Four men held on gang-rape charge in Saptari,"Police arrested four people for their alleged involvement in gang-raping a 17-year-old girl in Kanchanrup Municipality of Saptari. Three were detained on Monday while the fourth was held on Tuesday, said police.According to Deputy Superintendent of Police Dipak Kumar Raya, the suspects barged into the victim’s room on Friday night, took her out of the house and committed the crime. The accused, as the victim told investigation officers, took her to an empty house in the village and raped her in turn. The incident came to light after the girl lodged a complaint at the Area Police Office in Kanchanrup on Monday.The preliminary police investigation shows that the girl’s friend had come to meet her late Friday evening.

Man found murdered in Rautahat,,,,
Many local units in Madhesh are mired in disputes among elected officials,"The growing hostility between Mahendra Mahato and Sunita Singh Budhathoki, mayor and deputy mayor of Mithila Municipality in Dhanusha, has affected important development projects and daily administrative works of the local unit.Mahato, who was elected mayor on a Nepali Congress ticket, had postponed the municipal council meeting scheduled for June 25 after knowing that Deputy Mayor Budhathoki, who is from the UML, along with other local government officials elected from the party were planning to boycott the meeting. No new date for the meeting has been announced. The council meeting was deferred last year as well due to similar differences between the two elected officials.Sangita Kumari Ram, the deputy mayor of Rautahat’s Brindaban Municipality, boycotted the annual municipal council meeting accusing the mayor, Binod Patel, of attempting to convene the meeting without her consent. She accused the mayor of preparing the policy and programme as well as the budget unilaterally without consulting her and other elected representatives. Owing to the protest, Brindaban’s annual council was postponed soon after the inaugural function of the municipal council. Kumari Ram has the support of 28 people’s representatives including six ward chiefs. The mayor and deputy mayor are currently not on speaking terms. Ram Ekbal Yadav, a resident of Brindaban Municipality-7, says he is frustrated at the way things are unfolding in the municipality. “We elected the representatives to the posts with the belief that they would work for the welfare of the people,” said Yadav. “But the long-standing disputes between the mayor and deputy mayor show that our welfare is not their priority. Their disputes crippled development activities here and service seekers like me are also deprived of administrative services.”Mayor Lalan Gupta and Deputy Mayor Muna Kumari Pokharel of Kanchanrup Municipality in Saptari district were both elected from the Congress. Expressing her dissatisfaction with the budget and the policy and programme, Pokharel proposed to postpone the ongoing municipal council on June 25. The deputy mayor has the support of the majority of members in the municipality.According to the provisions of the Local Government Operation Act and Intergovernmental Fiscal Arrangement Act, all the local units in Nepal are required to present their annual budgets by June 25 every year.Out of 136 local units in the Madhesh Province, 100 presented their budgets on time. However, as many as 36 local units failed to convene the annual council due to disputes among the people’s representatives. In most local units, there are long-running disputes between mayors and deputy mayors. The annual council meetings for the upcoming fiscal year of two sub-metropolises, 18 municipalities and 16 rural municipalities were obstructed in the Madhesh Province this fiscal year. There are a total of one metropolitan city, three sub-metropolitan cities, 73 municipalities and 59 rural municipalities in the Madhesh province, which is the country’s smallest province in terms of area. Seven local units in Saptari, six each in Parsa and Rautahat, five in Bara, four each in Sarlahi and Dhanusha, two in Mahottari and one local unit in Siraha have yet to hold their annual council meetings. Disputes among the people’s representatives have paralysed the local units in the province and affected daily administrative work and developmental activities. In Kankalini Municipality of Saptari, Mayor Birendra Majhi and Deputy Mayor Sarita Sipaliya Yadav are in a long-running tussle, which has led to an indefinite postponement of the annual municipal council meeting. Majhi represents the Janamat Party while Sipaliya won the local election on a Rastriya Janata Party ticket.Some of the issues that cause disputes among the mayors and deputy mayors include project selection, budget allocation, and use of office vehicles and other benefits. While the reason behind the disputes in most of the local units is that mayors and deputy mayors are from different parties, in some local units even those from the same political parties are also not on good terms. Haripurwa Municipality in Sarlahi district has been the victim of two rival factions of the Nepali Congress. Mayor Binod Sah and Deputy Mayor Sumitra Devi Gwarin are from the same party, but they accuse each other of working unilaterally ignoring the genuine concerns of the other. Due to the dispute, the supporters of the deputy mayor padlocked the municipality’s office for about three months, which has hugely affected development activities. The lock was removed only two weeks ago. “Of the total Rs340 million development budget, only around Rs15 million was spent in the current fiscal year. The budget of almost all development projects in Haripurwa has gone unspent due to the disputes,” said Nimesh Mishra, the chief administrative officer of the local unit. The Local Election Act-2017 makes it mandatory for each political party contesting local elections to field a woman for either chief or deputy chief of local units. Most of the parties confine women to the deputy chief/chair position. The legal provision requiring one of the two candidates for the chief or deputy chief at the local level to be a woman is applicable only when a party fields candidates for both positions. But this requirement does not apply when parties contest elections by forming alliances resulting in women losing both the positions..The Local Government Operation Act delegates various powers and authorities to the deputy mayor or vice-chair. The deputy mayor/vice-chair is the coordinator of the judicial committee, project monitoring committee, and the budget consultation committee, among others. But the deputy chiefs, mostly women, are denied the authority. The female people’s representatives complained that women elected officials are not even given the roles guaranteed by prevailing laws. “The male representatives think that they are powerful. The deputy chief has the authority to monitor development projects and issue recommendations for payment. But the male local unit chiefs have been exercising that authority,” said Punam Chaudhary, the deputy mayor of Garuda Municipality in Rautahat district.Chaudhary, six ward chiefs and 24 ward members staged a sit-in a few weeks ago stating that Mayor Kanthamani Jaisawal made decisions unilaterally by sidelining the deputy mayor and other people’s representatives. “We had to resort to protest as our powers and authorities were seized by the mayor,” said Chaudhary. Kanthamani, however, denied any wrongdoing. “We have not sidelined the deputy mayor in the decision-making process. We don’t know what her demands are,” he said.","Published at : July 12, 2023",Rautahat/janakpur,Shiva Puri &
Locals obstruct East-West Highway against ‘mistreatment’ by mayor,,,,
UML obstructs Madhesh provincial assembly meeting,"The CPN-UML on Saturday obstructed the meeting of the Madhesh provincial assembly, accusing Minister for Economic Affairs Sanjay Yadav of corruption by transferring government funds unlawfully.As soon as the provincial assembly meeting commenced, UML assembly member Lakhan Das demanded Chief Minister Saroj Kumar Yadav to clarify to the assembly why the conditional grants to the local level and funds of various ministries were transferred to projects only in Sarlahi at the end of the financial year.The meeting was adjourned for 10 minutes after Das said the party will not allow the provincial assembly to proceed until the chief minister clarifies the matter.Minister Yadav was scheduled to present a proposal to start deliberations on the appropriation bill in today’s meeting.The UML that has been obstructing proceedings in both the House of Representatives and National Assembly over the prime minister’s remarks for the last couple of days has resorted to the same approach in the provincial assembly as well.","Published at : July 8, 2023",Dhanusha,Santosh Singh
"Police fire into air, baton charge to disperse protestors in Saptari","Police on Wednesday baton-charged demonstrators in Saptari to disperse the crowd to resume traffic on the East-West highway.Locals from the Mahuli River area took to the streets on Wednesday protesting against the local government’s apathy to the yearly flooding in the area.The agitated locals had been staging protests on the Mahuli river bridge, disrupting the traffic along the Portaha section of the East-West highway on Wednesday.Police baton-charged protestors and fired a round of bullets into the air to disperse the crowd as security personnel and demonstrators engaged in an altercation during the former’s attempt to clear the road, said Superintendent of Police Narendra Kumar Karki. Traffic has now resumed on the highway, Karki added.Every monsoon, the areas around the Mahuli River experience floods as the river breaks the barricades and enters the homes of the locals. The locals accuse the government of not making any efforts to prevent disasters even as water levels in the river have started to rise.","Published at : July 5, 2023",Saptari,Abdesh Kumar Jha
Poor reproductive health plagues Musahar women,"Jaikal Devi Sada from Maintole in Sonama Rural Municipality-7 got married when she was all of 14. The criminalisation of child marriage in the country hasn’t stopped Musahar parents here to marry off their children that young. When she gave birth to her first daughter, Jaikal was 15. Now she is 27 and a mother of five children—the youngest is just three years old. But Jaikal does not have the resources to feed herself and her children. Most days, the family goes to bed hungry, with the young children pestering their mother for food.With her husband in India for employment, Jaikal shoulders the responsibility of taking care of her children all alone. And it has taken a toll on her health, already weakened by multiple pregnancies. Jaikal now suffers from reproductive health issues like irregular periods and infection in the uterus that have led to purulent drainage. She, however, has not visited a health facility for treatment. She can’t afford it.“My menstrual cycle is disrupted. I haven’t had my period since March. Most women in our settlement are going through similar health issues, but none of us has gone for a health checkup,” said Jaikal. “My husband is in Chennai in India. He has left me with our children in this tiny one-room hut but with no means to feed ourselves. My husband brings money when he comes, but he doesn’t come home often so I work for daily wages to look after the children.”Despite the struggles, Jaikal perseveres because she feels she has done her duty by giving birth to a son and is happy in the knowledge that her husband will now not leave her for her failure to produce a son. “I had three daughters before my son was born. My husband had warned me he would leave me for another if I didn’t bear him a son,” she said. “Frequent pregnancies made me weak, but I am happy that at least I have a son now.” Given a deeply patriarchal social structure, most families in Nepal still prefer a son over a daughter.There are 70 households in the Musahar settlement and most women have a similar story to tell.Most of the houses have only women, elderly, and children with men going to India to earn a living. Almost every family has four to five children and all families live in crammed huts. The women work as daily wage workers at construction sites to feed themselves and their families.According to the National Census 2021, 48.7 percent of girls between the ages of 18 and 20 in the rural municipality get married while 40.8 percent of girls get married between the ages of 15 and 17.Early marriage in the Musahar community is the driving force behind adolescent pregnancy wherein girls have sex before they are physically and emotionally ready, and when they are unaware of their reproductive health and the repercussions of frequent pregnancies. Kaushila Devi Sada, a 25-year-old woman who is seven months pregnant, is going to become a mother for the fifth time in 10 years. The pregnant woman neither has the money to eat nutritious food nor feed her children. When told how important a nutritious diet is for her and her unborn child, Kaushila says she managed without nutritious food in her previous pregnancies and is certain her latest pregnancy would also not be affected by lack of a good diet. There is a basic health service centre about 15 minutes from the Musahar settlement in Sonama-7, but the health services extended to pregnant women is limited. According to Ram Sanjog Mahato, public health inspector at the centre, the community health centre provides free examinations to those from disadvantaged groups and offers 45 types of medicine for free. “But the health centres are not fully equipped to diagnose diseases or run tests so most of the time it works as a referral centre,” he said. “There are only two health workers posted at the centre and neither is female. That is also why women do not visit the health centre with their reproductive health issues.”Under the federal government’s safe motherhood programme, pregnant women in the mountainous, hilly and Tarai regions get Rs3,000, Rs2,000 and Rs1,000, respectively. Additionally, a cash bonus of Rs800 is provided to mothers who complete all four antenatal checkups.But Kaushila who has never visited the health centre during any of her pregnancies is unaware of such benefits. She, like most women in the settlement, does not visit health centres fearing doctors will recommend various treatments. “If I go to a health facility, they will diagnose my disease and ask me to seek treatment for it in big hospitals. I don’t have the money to do that,” she said. “If I had money, I would rather spend it on food for my children.” Like Jaikal’s children, Kaushila’s children also keep fighting for food because there is not enough for everyone. According to Dr Manisha Bhardwaj, a gynaecologist at the district hospital, around 60 percent of women from poor and underprivileged communities in Mahottari who marry at a young age and give birth to children before the appropriate age face complex health problems.Giving birth before the age of 19 and after 35 is risky for both the mother and the infant, said Bhardwaj. “Being pregnant at a young age not only affects the health of the mother, but also affects the health of the newborn. Problems such as malnutrition, lack of weight gain and lack of the necessary development of bones appear in newborns,” she said. According to the Madhesh Province Health Directorate, 50 percent of women and children in Madhesh Province are at risk of malnutrition.Binod Yadav, director of Public Health Services at the Madhesh Province Health Directorate, said that due to early marriage, the number of malnutrition cases in Madhesh Province is becoming alarming. “The families of poor, Dalits, and other underprivileged communities are becoming malnourished due to early marriage. Weak financial conditions contribute to poor reproductive health in women and poor health in children,” said Yadav.Recently, the District Health Office conducted a cervical health examination of 2,121 women from all eight districts of Madhesh province in coordination with non-governmental organisations. The result of the examination drive showed 59 of the examinees have cervical cancer, and 562 women are at high risk of uterine prolapse.According to Pratibha Singh, focal person of the health office, the data also suggest that women from Muslim, Dalit, poor, and underprivileged communities, especially those who have married at a young age, given birth to many children, and done hard labour during pregnancy, are at high risk of uterine cancer.“During the health examination of 640 women in the three local units of Mahottari alone, 91 women had prolapsed uterus and 20 people had cervical cancer,” said Singh.Aagma Devi Sada, 25, says despite living with serious health issues, women in the settlement avoid health check ups. “We just live with it because we know the health workers will ask us to go to a hospital for treatment. What use are medicines when we are on an empty stomach most days,” she said.","Published at : July 3, 2023",Mahottari,Sunita Baral

Youths deprived of citizenship finally find happiness,"Indrajit Safi is an engineer by profession. A resident of Dhanusha district, he was on the forefront of the longstanding struggle of thousands of youths deprived of citizenship for years. He spearheaded a sit-in and confrontation at Maitighar in Kathmandu, almost every day ever since the Supreme Court issued an interim order in response to a writ petition filed against President Ramchandra Paudel’s authentication of new amendments to the Citizenship Act. Indrajit’s struggle finally paid off on Sunday as the apex court on Thursday cleared the way for the implementation of new amendments to the Citizenship Act.Indrajit, along with his mother Sonawati and three brothers, reached the District Administration Office (DAO) in Dhanusha in the first hour on Sunday and submitted all required documents. Indrajit and his three brothers received citizenship by descent from Chief District Officer Kashiraj Dahal.“This moment has turned all the hardships including those we endured during protests at Maitighar into happiness. I wish nobody will have to struggle for citizenship when they have to focus on studies and make a career,” Indrajit told the Post after he acquired citizenship.After Indrajit and his brothers were handed over citizenship certificates they hugged their mother. They came down where many people were queuing for citizenship, and took a family photo with the queue in the background. They posted the photo on social media and shared happiness. Indrajit is the central chairman of the struggle committee of the people deprived of citizenship. The 31-year-old engineer is a resident of ward 3 of Ganeshman Charnath Municipality in Dhanusha. He and his brother could not acquire citizenship when they attained the required age for citizenship. His brothers Ranjit, 29, Chhotu, 22, and Rabin, 21, were visibly elated and credited Indrajit’s long struggle for the joyous moment..Indrajit has a long history of struggle for citizenship. He had been running from pillar to post for citizenship. “Earlier, I didn’t care much about citizenship, thinking that both my parents have citizenship and I could acquire it easily. I went to Kathmandu to study grade 11 and 12 after passing the School Leaving Certificate in 2013. I was asked to furnish a citizenship certificate to get enrolled for engineering,” Indrajit shared his ordeal.“I immediately went to Dhanusha to get citizenship. But the district administration office returned me empty handed stating that the Supreme Court prevented people like me from acquiring citizenship certificates,” said Indrajit.According to him, the DAO employees assured him that a new law would be formulated so that children of the people who acquired Nepali citizenship by birth would get citizenship. “I waited for two years for citizenship. Later I went to India to study engineering after learning that a citizenship certificate was not required to study there,” said Indrajit.Many people like Indrajit have acquired citizenship after the new amendments of the Citizenship Act came into implementation across the nation. They are now relieved from ‘statelessness’.“I now feel that I am a citizen of Nepal. My happiness has no bound for being Nepali citizen. I will work for my country,” said Indrajit, a civil engineer. Renu Kumari Yadav of Bishnupur in Siraha also acquired citizenship. She married a few years ago and gave birth to a daughter. But her child was deprived of birth registration as Renu did not have a citizenship certificate. “I feel that I have won a big battle. It took just about half an hour to get citizenship after fulfilling the necessary process and documents,” said an elated Renu proudly holding her citizenship card.On Sunday and Monday, the DAO, Parsa was crowded mainly with the youths who waited in serpentine queues for citizenship. They seemed a bit anxious and in a hurry fearing that the Supreme Court or any higher authorities could issue another order to prevent the implementation of the new amendment to the Citizenship Act.“I was in a panic until I got my citizenship. Finally I am a citizen of my country,” said Bhim Chaube, a 23-year-old man from Birgunj Metropolis-6 in Parsa. He complained that he had been offered to work as an accountant in a multinational company along the Parsa-Bara Industrial Corridor last year, but he could not take the offer as he did not have a citizenship. “Now that I have a citizenship certificate, I will find a good job,” said Chaube. According to Binaya Kumar Shrivastav, spokesman at the DAO in Parsa, around 70 people who were earlier deprived of citizenship, acquired citizenship on Sunday alone.In Morang, Niraj Kamat who attempted to self-immolate at Maitighar in the first week of June protesting the Supreme Court’s interlocutory interim order not to implement the new amendments of the Citizenship Act, received citizenship on Monday. Chief District Officer of Morang Birendra Kumar Yadav handed him the citizenship certificate.“I was deprived of opportunities and benefits provided by the state due to the lack of citizenship. I returned from the mouth of death and finally acquired citizenship. Our protests finally paid off,” said Kamat, aged 25, of Katahari Rural Municipality-4. He said his dream to be a police officer was ruined due to the lack of citizenship and he could not continue his studies in desperation. According to him, his father Kisun Dev Kamat had acquired citizenship by birth while his mother Gulab Devi Chaudhary had acquired citizenship by descent, but he was deprived of citizenship. The Supreme Court on Thursday cleared the way for the implementation of new amendments to the Citizenship Act that were authenticated by President Paudel. A division bench of justices Ananda Mohan Bhattarai and Kumar Regmi decided not to give continuity to the interlocutory interim order earlier issued by the single bench of Justice Manoj Sharma. Hearing the writ petition filed by senior advocates Surendra Bhandari and Bal Krishna Neupane, the apex court on June 4 had ordered authorities not to enforce the new amendments. The petitioners had filed the petition at the apex court following the President’s authentication of the amendment bill, stating that President Paudel had endorsed the Citizenship Bill unconstitutionally. The court’s latest order has cleared the way for thousands of children of parents who got citizenship by birth to acquire citizenship by descent. The new amendment is expected to benefit around 400,000 people. President Ram Chandara Paudel on May 31 had authenticated the bill—the same one that his predecessor Bidya Devi Bhandari had twice refused to endorse—after repeated requests from the government followed by a series of consultations with legal and political experts.(With inputs from Deo Narayan Sah in Morang)","Published at : June 27, 2023",Janakpur/parsa,Ajit Tiwari &
Rhino found dead in Parsa National Park,"A rhinoceros was found dead in Parsa National Park on Saturday.The park officials located the carcass of the rhinoceros some eight km west of Pratappur post in the national park.According to Surya Khadka, information and assistant conservation officer, it is believed that the poachers killed the rhinoceros as the patrolling team deployed from the national park office did not recover its horn.Officials say the rhino looks like an adult and is estimated to be killed some three months ago.One-horned rhinoceros is an endangered species and is sought after by poachers for its horns.Despite a significant decrease in poaching incidents in recent years, the number of rhinos dying due to natural causes, in-fighting, and other accidents has increased.As per the 2021 census, Nepal is home to 752 one-horned rhinos. The country’s rhino population stood at 645 in its four protected areas in 2015.","Published at : June 25, 2023",Parsa,Shankar Acharya
Kin demand justice as woman’s death raises suspicion,"Aarati Sah, a 22-year-old woman from Dhanusha, died under suspicious circumstances on May 21. Her family has accused her husband’s family of beating Aarati to death for not bringing enough dowry.Motibabu Sah of Thapa Chowk in Janakpur Sub-Metropolitan City-9 and Aarati of Nagarain Municipality-8 were married around two years ago. Theirs was an arranged marriage and Binod Sah, Aarati’s father, alleges his son-in-law and his family killed Aarati for not bringing enough dowry. Motibabu’s family said Aarati was rescued and rushed to the hospital immediately after she was found hanging at home. She was pronounced dead at Kavya Hospital.On Tuesday, Aarati’s relatives and well-wishers resorted to vandalism in Janakpur. The protesters hurled stones at the Dhanusha district court while the custodial hearing of the victim’s husband and father-in-law was underway at the court.Motibabu and his father Madan Sah were taken into police custody a few days ago for investigation into the case.According to Deputy Superintendent of Police Bed Prasad Gautam, scores of Aarati’s supporters attempted to barge into the court demanding the ‘death penalty’ for the suspects. “The security personnel were compelled to use force after the enraged protesters hurled stones and attempted to enter the court compound,” said Gautam. A protester was taken into custody.Police resorted to baton charges in which four demonstrators sustained injuries. A female police officer was also injured in the violent clash.The supporters of deceased Sah have been staging demonstrations in Janakpur as well as in Kathmandu demanding justice for the victim and strong action against the guilty. They accuse the police of not investigating the case sincerely with the intention to free the suspects. Aarati’s father, Binod Sah, his mother, brother, sister, maternal uncle and some other relatives came to Kathmandu on June 16 to pressure the authority for a fair investigation into the case. They have been staging a sit-in protest at Maitighar, Kathmandu, demanding action against the guilty.According to Binod, he had provided Rs2.5 million cash to Motilal’s family two years ago at the time of her wedding as dowry. “The husband, father-in-law, mother-in-law and brother-in-law had been torturing my daughter for not bringing more dowry. It was not suicide. They murdered her,” he said, demanding a fair investigation into the case. Meanwhile, the single bench of judge Ram Prasad Neupane remanded Motibabu and Madan into judicial custody following the court hearing on Tuesday.A team from the Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) of Nepal Police started an investigation into the case. The team is now in Janakpur. According to the District Police Office in Dhanusha, the CIB team has not disclosed any information since the case is still under investigation. A medical team in Janakpur Provincial Hospital carried out a postmortem of the deceased on May 22. The postmortem report says that the victim died by hanging and it could be a suicide. The report mentions that the victim sustained deep injuries on her cheek.","Published at : June 21, 2023",Dhanusha,Santosh Singh

Birgunj locals march to Kathmandu to highlight Sirsiya River pollution,"Sirsiya River that flows through Birgunj, a major business and industrial hub in Parsa district of Madhesh Province, has become highly polluted due to the toxic industrial waste generated by several factories on the Parsa-Bara Industrial Corridor. The factories release untreated waste into the river, locals say, resulting in the river turning into an open sewer.In an apparent bid to exert pressure on authorities concerned and to bring to light the worsening water pollution in Sirsiya River, 10 days ago, a group of Birgunj residents set off on a march to Kathmandu carrying the polluted water from the river. The march that started on May 18 finally reached the Capital on Saturday evening through Hetauda, Narayanghat and Muglin.“The initiatives of the local government were not enough to control pollution in Sirsiya. So we decided to launch the long march to Kathmandu to put pressure on the federal government to look into the matter,” said Saroj Raya, patron of Chure Forest Conservation Campaign. According to him, a group of 25 people are participating in the march. “We walked around 25 kilometres a day. We plan to hand over the polluted water to the government in Singha Durbar.”The locals of Het settlement in Jitpur Simara sub-metropolitan city-23 of Bara district where the river originates and flows towards the middle Ganga plains in India say the water in the Bara section of the river is clean enough for household use.“However, by the time the river reaches Parwanipur in Birgunj-21 just one and a half kilometres downstream, the river turns toxic as a result of the waste released into the river by factories and industries,” said Ajija Miya of Parwanipur. “The river no longer supports aquatic life. The water is unfit for consumption even by the cattle. It’s hard to believe that until a few years ago, people used to bathe and wash in the river in the Parwanipur area.”The factories along the Parsa-Bara industrial corridor frequently release untreated waste into the river, giving its water a perpetually murky hue. Earlier, water from the same river was used for drinking and washing by households in more than a dozen VDCs in Parsa and Bara districts. “Today, the river is so polluted that its water has become unsupportive of any form of life,” said Miya.Various textile, pharmaceutical, leather and meat factories, among others, line the corridor. “The river emits a foul smell. It is becoming increasingly difficult to go anywhere near it,” said Sabdar Hussein of Parwanipur. According to him, most of the factories along the corridor have water treatment plants, but they don’t treat the wastewater before emptying it into the river.The Sirsiya river, which originates from Ramban forest in Jitpur Simara-3 of Bara, has cultural significance as well. It is an important water body for devotees during Chhath, a major Hindu festival in the central Tarai. The devotees are hit hardest by the pollution.Chhath organisers have for the past several years been urging the district administration to take initiatives to control river pollution, at least during Chhath, which is celebrated for five days. On the instructions of the district administration office, the factories are closed during Chhath and the pollution in the Sirsiya river automatically comes down for a few days, say locals. The group of visiting activists arrived in Kathmandu on Saturday evening.  Deepak KC/TKPSome factories along the corridor were set up some eight decades ago. Over time, their numbers have multiplied. Since the 1970s, the pollution level in the river has increased significantly.The local people of Simara, Tajapur, Parwanipur, Lohasanda, Ramauli, Jagarnathpur, Rampur Tokani, Sagardina, Chhatapipara, Nitanpur, Gamhargaon, Ramgadhawa, Ranighat, Sirsiya Khalwatol, and Birgunj metropolis sections along the Parsa-Bara industrial area are hugely affected by the river pollution. The deterioration of the river makes life difficult also for the residents of the East Champaran district of Bihar, India.A study conducted by the then Ministry of Population and Environment seven years ago shows that as many as 250 factories discharged polluted waters and chemicals directly into the Sirsiya. Earlier, the district administration office in Parsa had formed a committee to study the pollution in the river. The committee’s report had pointed to industrial discharge as the main cause of river pollution.Birgunj Metropolitan City formed the Sirsiya River Pollution Control Committee chaired by deputy mayor Imtiyaz Alam a few months ago. The committee monitors the factories and businesses in the area. According to Laxmi Prasad Paudel, chief administrative officer, the committee in March decided to fine five firms Rs300,000 each for polluting the river in the month. But the firms have yet to pay the fine.“We are coordinating with the Birgunj Chamber of Commerce and Industry to control pollution in Sirsiya. The process to scrap the licence of the factories that have not paid the fine is underway,” said Mayor Rajeshman Singh.At the initiative of the Birgunj chamber, a gathering of industrialists on the Parsa-Bara corridor was held in Birgunj in January. Sirsiya River pollution was the main agenda of the gathering. The industrialists had agreed to set up water treatment plants at their factories within a week and promised to release only treated water into the river. But they never kept their promise.","Published at : May 29, 2023",Birgunj,Bhusan Yadav

Poaching surges as wildfires force animals out of forests,"Two months ago, a severely injured blue bull (Boselaphus tragocamelus) was rescued from the Bakaiya riverside in the Junglesaiya forest in Rautahat. Forest officials sent the injured animal to Parsa National Park for treatment. “The blue bull had several injuries on its body. It had been speared in several places including in the head and hump,” said Ram Prasad Sah, information officer of the Division Forest Office, Rautahat. “Hunters use nets, traps and homemade weapons to trap and attack wild animals that leave the forest.”Several of Rautahat’s forests were engulfed by wildfires in the past few months. The start of the wildfire season saw an increase in illegal poaching and hunting activities in forest areas, Sunil Kumar Karna, head of the Division Forest Office told the Post. “Wild animals tend to leave the forest grounds fleeing the fires which makes it easier for poachers to trap and kill them,” said Karna.According to the forest office, three loaded guns were recovered from the Chocha and BalariKhor National Forest areas five months ago. Similarly, on April 15, three more guns were recovered from the same forest areas.On April 21, Ek Bahadur Jargha Magar of Gaidatar village, Chandrapur Municipality Ward 3, was arrested for killing a wild boar. Magar and four others were arrested with dead wild boars from his house. A case has been filed against them under the Wildlife Act, according to the forest office.Forests in Rautahat are home to tigers, blue bulls, deer, wild boars, elephants, and monkeys, among others, according to the forest office. Illegal poaching activities are being reported from Chetanagar, Chandrapur, Gaidatar, Rangapur, and Balari forest areas. A total of 29,400 hectares is forest in Rautahat. Hunting activities have increased especially in Chetanagar, Chandrapur, Gaidatar, Rangapur, and Balari forest areas.Locals living near forest areas also say that they have recovered several nets and traps in the forests and areas close to human settlements where the animals fleeing fire tend to escape to. According to some locals, the poachers and hunters work in cahoots with some of the locals to find ideal spots to set traps for wild animals. “In the last couple of months I have recovered several nets and traps in the forest,” said a local of Balarikhor, Brindawan Municipality Ward 1. “I informed the forest officials and they removed the traps.” “Humans and animals always cross paths in this area,” said Ramchandra Khadel, former secretary of the Ministry of Forest, Madhesh Province. “This year the animals are escaping the forests to avoid wildfires. This has led to an increase in poaching activities. Wild animals enter the fields and human settlements for food, water, and safety. Upon seeing them so close to human settlements in a vulnerable state, not only poachers but locals also kill them.”Karna says the forest office plans to mobilise a special team of security personnel in the forests to stop illegal activities. “We will increase security in the forests and monitor the entry and exit points,” he said. “We also need to sensitise the locals about the need to protect the animals in the forests.”","Published at : May 8, 2023",Rautahat,Shiva Puri

Drug trade  becoming difficult to control in Sarlahi,"Last Saturday, a teacher at a private school in Sarlahi was arrested for drug possession.Raja Hussain, a teacher at Rajdevi Boarding School in Ishwarpur Municipality, was arrested from the school premises in possession of Nitrovet tablets, marijuana and a brass knuckle. He is currently in the custody of the Kesharganj Area Police Office for further investigation.The arrest is not a one-off incident in Sarlahi. The district has of late become a major transit point for drug trade, police say. “Drug dealers are taking advantage of the open border to buy drugs from India, take them to the hilly areas, and sell them there,” said SP Naresh Raj Subedi of the District Police Office. “They are using local residents to carry contrabands and sell them locally.”The involvement of even school teachers in drug trade is a worrying sign, says Subedi. “This inadvertently encourages students to use drugs,” he said. “If contraband is so easily available, it won’t be long before students get involved in the use, buying and even selling of drugs.”About three months ago, students of Balgovind Janata Secondary School in Kawilasi Municipality Ward 2 were invited to visit a private school in Nawalpur for two days. The students visiting the private school were accused of using marijuana during their trip.While educators put the blame on the guardians, the latter find fault in the government mechanism and lack of security checks and monitoring in border areas.“Drug addiction is spreading in the school due to the carelessness and weakness of the parents,” said Badrinarayan Mishra, principal of Balgovind Janata Secondary School. “Parents must play a more engaging role in the lives of their children. We can only keep an eye on them when they are at school. But when they are outside school, we can’t control what they do or don’t.”Rajnikant Jha, a local resident, says the inefficiency of concerned authorities to monitor border points where drug trade takes place has led to the easy availability of contraband in the villages.“Police personnel are the only ones trying to stop illegal drug use. But they alone can’t stop this growing problem among young people,” said Jha. “All levels of government must start taking this matter seriously because it affects our children.”According to the data of the district police, 113 people have been arrested in 88 drug cases in Sarlahi in the current fiscal year. In the fiscal year 2021-22, 126 people were arrested in illegal drug cases.“Drug control is becoming increasingly challenging for us due to the open border and limited manpower,” said Subedi from the District Police Office. “The local police and those in border security are doing their best to control the transportation of drugs through the open border but we haven’t been able to do that completely.”","Published at : April 9, 2023",Sarlahi,Om Prakash Thakur

Musahar man kills self amid looming eviction,"Upendra Dhanukar, a 40-year-old Musahar man, died by suicide on Saturday night. Dhanukar was under immense pressure after being told to vacate his house in a Musahar settlement in Kawilasi Municipality ward-7, where his family had been living for the past five decades, according to his family members.The post-mortem report confirmed Dhanukar had died by suicide. The police handed over the body to his family on Monday. Musahars from the settlement led protests on Monday morning in Gaurchowk along the Nawalpur-Malangwa road section accusing the moneyed of displacing the Musahar community.According to Lalka Majhi, a Musahar woman, 24 families have been living in Kawilasi ward-7 on a plot of land measuring approximately 8.5 kattha (around 2,900 square metres) for several years. Madan Krishna Prasai, the previous land owner, had given them the land to settle down, says Majhi. But the residents never had the land registered under their names.The Sarlahi District Court states that the said land was auctioned by the court in 2010 after Mukul Prasai, Madan Krishna’s son, failed to pay his loan to one Ram Kailash Raya. Rai won the auction.Following the auction, Raya visited the Musahar settlement several times to evict the settlers. But the locals protested and prevented Raya and the police from bulldozing the homes of the Musahars. Bereaved family members and relatives of Upendra Dhanukar, who killed himself allegedly after his family was told to move out from a piece of land they have been living in for years.  Om Prakash Thakur/TKPAfter several disputes between the Musahars and Raya and initiatives from the police and the local administration, an agreement was reached on Friday between the Musahars and Raya. At the meeting held at Kawilasi Area Police Station Raya agreed to compensate the Musahars with Rs7 million on condition that they leave the land.Majhi claims the Musahars were coerced into signing the agreement by Raya in cahoots with local politicians. “They put pressure on us at the police station. We had told them we only wanted half of the land to live in but the other party refused,” she said. “Rs7 million compensation is not enough for 24 families. With that money, we can’t move anywhere else and settle down.”According to Rajnikant Jha, a human rights advocate from Kawilasi ward-7, those wanting to remove the Musahars from their settlement must take the responsibility for Dhanukar’s death.“Dhanukar was a leader of the Musahars in the area. Friday’s forced agreement left him dejected. He was driven to a point where he had to kill himself,” said Jha.Dhanukar’s wife, Rekha, says her husband was not in favour of the agreement since he did not want to leave his birthplace. “He was willing to participate in the auction and pay the money for the land as directed by the court, but he wasn’t allowed to do that,” said Rekha. “Since the court’s decision in 2010 to auction the land, we haven’t had an easy life. My husband was at his wit’s end and he decided to take his life.”Dhanukar has left behind his wife, two daughters and a son. The youngest daughter is 10 years old. Rekha is now worried for her children and their well-being since she does not have the financial resources to take care of them. “We will soon be displaced. I don’t know where I will go with my children,” she said.","Published at : March 31, 2023",Sarlahi,Om Prakash Thakur

The three road sections are the major routes connecting a majority of villages in Saptari and east Dhanusha to Janakpur. “For the past week, I have been using the bus to travel to and from Janakpur. I am spending at least Rs200 per day just on transportation,” said Sahani. “I used to make a profit of Rs500 to Rs1,000 every day selling vegetables. Now I am spending a considerable chunk of my profit on transport fare.” The disruption of the three major road sections has created several challenges for the locals, farmers, daily wage workers and businesses. According to Dinesh Sah, owner of Bishwakant Furniture at Kadamchowk, the footfall in his shop has seen a significant decline since the road construction began. “Work on all three road sections is estimated to be completed in four months,” said Sah. “I don’t know if my business will be able to sustain without customers for so long.” More than 150 to 200 local businesses at Kadamchowk have been affected by the disruption in road connectivity. “Before demolishing the bridges and disrupting the roads, both authorities should have constructed an alternative road to Janakpur, but they did not. Now people have to take a detour of 60km to 80km to reach Janakpur from the villages. Earlier they needed to travel 10km-15km to reach Janakpur,” said Shah.  Shyam Sundar Shashi/TKPLack of coordination between the Postal Highway project and the Department of Urban Development led to both the projects being implemented simultaneously. “Road upgrade work and construction of sewage tunnels started at the same time a week ago. The authorities did not think before starting work on these projects together and the impact it would have on the lives of the locals,” said Shah.“The locals are furious because all three roads are blocked at once. The bridge should have been demolished only after constructing an alternative road,” said Bharat Sah, a bicycle dealer at Pulchowk in Janakpur-1.According to officials of Sugam Construction Company, which has been contracted to construct the two bridges, the bridges will be ready by the end of the current fiscal year, which is mid-July.  Shyam Sundar Shashi/TKPLaxman Yadav, Divisional Engineer of the Federal Planning Implementation Unit, says their department was unaware of the Postal Highway’s plans to construct the bridges in the two major road sections leading to Janakpur. He expects their project to also finish by the end of the current fiscal year.Similarly, according to divisional engineer Krishna Dev Mahato of the Postal Highway project, they too were unaware of the Federal Planning Implementation Unit’s project. An all-party meeting was held at the district administration office (Dhanusha) before the bridges were demolished. According to the decision of the meeting, with the aim of completing the construction by the end of the fiscal year, both roads were demolished simultaneously.“We couldn’t create an alternate route before starting the upgrade work, but we will try to complete the project as soon as possible,” said Mahato.“This is the season to sell wheat grains and I am having difficulty reaching the markets owing to the road construction work,” said Sahani. “It will soon be time to plant paddy, so farmers in Siraha and eastern Dhanusha are worried because road disruption will hamper the supply of seeds, workers and machinery.”  Shyam Sundar Shashi/TKP","Published at : March 28, 2023",Dhanusha,Shyam Sundar Sashi

Some see cultural shift in vanishing clay tile roofs,"Ham Na Rahab Saiya Mati ke ghar me,Paka Pitwaida balamuwa…(I don’t want to live in a mud house, husbandPlease build a concrete house for me)The song by Bhojpuri singers Nisha Dubey and Arvind Akela tells a story of a woman who is asking her husband in a foreign land to send her money to build a concrete house. She no longer wants to live in a house with clay tile roofing. The song topped the charts in Madhesh when it was released some two decades ago. A majority of the listeners related to the song since it depicted the condition of the settlements and homes of Madhesh at that time.Bhojpuri songs are popular in Mithila-Madhesh due to linguistic similarities. During the time of the release of the song, the trend of replacing mud houses with khapada (cylindrical interlocking clay tiles) roofing, with concrete houses had swept the region. The decade-long Maoist insurgency from 1996 crippled the economy of the country; the political situation was unstable and unemployment at its peak. This was when Madhesh, and the rest of the country, saw a mass exodus of young men leaving for foreign shores for employment. The steady flow of men from villages to Gulf nations in search of employment was directly proportional to the number of new concrete houses mushrooming in the villages. The trickle of remittance increased the income of almost every household. In Madhesh, those who went on foreign employment and earned money did two things—they replaced their tile-roofed mud houses with concrete houses and sent their children to private schools in cities. The increase in income courtesy of foreign employment and the association of tile-roofed houses with poverty attributed to the erasure of the built heritage that encompassed the architectural, cultural and social history of Madhesh, says Sahadev Pandit, a 70-year-old potter of Parwaha village in Kumhal Tole settlement in Aurahi Rural Municipality-2.“It also meant that the craft of making and installing roof tiles got lost,” said Pandit. “It is a special skill but these days it’s a skill that doesn’t pay.”Pandit spent his younger years baking roof tiles and clay utensils. “But now all my tools have been set aside, so has my skill. It no longer serves any purpose.” Being a potter installing clay tiles roofing meant travelling far and wide. Pandit recalls the time when he would be living out of a suitcase for weeks and only visit his home once or twice a month. “I started pottery when I was 10 years old. I used to travel, earn decent money, and meet new people. I have installed roofs in so many houses during my active years,” said Pandit. “But now my skills have no worth in this day and age.”Most of the new houses in Madhesh are built partially or fully with concrete with either concrete or zinc roofing—a sign of modernisation that has worked several craftsmen out of their jobs, says Hridaya Kant Mandal, a 70-year-old potter of Parwaha village. “My skillset went out of fashion a long time ago, but who am I to complain? I myself have been living in a concrete house for more than a decade now.” Phenhara village in Bishnu Rural Municipality of Sarlahi district near the Indian border was famous for its skilled pottery craft.Sogarath Pandit, a 60-year-old potter of Phenhara, says the village has the dominant population of communities such as Yadav, Kumhal, Sah and Brahmin. Until two decades ago, most of the houses had tile roofing, but now only one or two houses carry the traditional feature. One of the few structures with a tile roof is the Navaranga Hotel in Janakpur, the capital of Madhesh Province. It is also one of the oldest hotels in the city, but it too is soon letting go of the heritage it has carried for so long. The hotel will now be housed in a concrete building from mid-April, informs Prakash Bhagat, the owner. Bhagat, 35, says the maintenance cost of the tiles is costly these days and adds to the overhead burden of the business. “The repair and maintenance of clay roof tiles have to be done annually and the cost is high,” said Bhagat. “But the more pressing problem is finding skilled potters to make the tiles or replace them when needed. That’s why we plan to demolish the old structure and construct a concrete building.” Navrang Hotel is just an example. Almost every house in Madhesh today is made of concrete. Mahabir Singh, a resident of Gaushala Municipality Ward 12, Mahottari, recently built a concrete house and converted his old mud house into a shed and store.The difficulty in the maintenance of the clay tile roofing every year before the rainy season and the scarcity of skilled craftsmen to bake clay tiles prompted him to build a concrete house, he says. “I decided to not demolish the old house because, during summer months, the mud house is much cooler,” said Singh. “I will live in the new house during the winter and the rainy season, but during the summers I will go back to my old house. I will try to maintain the old house, cost and skills permitting.” Until 30 years ago, at the tail end of the rainy season and before the winter set in, potters would move around villages to make and repair tile roofs. The potters would move around in groups and spend months in one village making tiles because almost all the houses had tile roofing.Clay tiles are traditionally formed by hand, then textured or coloured and fired in high-temperature kilns to set. “Mudhouse with clay roof tiles, the walls covered in cow dung cakes, floors covered in a special mixture of water, cow dung, and mud was the identity of Madhesh. But the concrete houses have changed the face and identity of Tarai,” said Nitya Nanda Mandal, a writer from Janakpur. Old people grew up baking roof tiles and earthenware. Very few people are still in the profession.  Santosh Singh/TKPAccording to Dr Revati Raman Lal of Janakpur, a cultural expert, special skills are required not only to make clay tiles but also to cover the roof. The installation of clay tile roofing is only possible in slope roof-style structures. Hay and yellow mud locally known as Piyari Mati is used as an adhesive to stick the tiles together and onto the frame of the roof.The traditional mud houses with clay tile roofing not only hold cultural importance but also define the geography of Madhesh, says Lal. “The houses are made of simple materials such as mud, hay and wood which all are biodegradable and do not affect the environment like the way concrete structures do. There is no need to excavate rivers or dig mountains for stones. The materials needed in clay tile roofing last a lifetime and are reusable.”Lal rues the vanishing of an important aspect of Madhesh with the disappearance of clay tile roofing. “Modernisation has had an adverse impact and has changed the intrinsic cultural values showcased through crafts by Madhesis. Mud houses did not need replacement in Tarai where the weather is mostly hot since mud houses and clay tiles act as coolants for the inhabitants.”The nuclear family set-up; gentrification of rural villages and the declining practice of farming have also contributed to the disappearance of traditional houses in Madhesh, says Lal. “The disappearance of traditional houses has made way for the appearance of foreign folk culture, folklore, drama, patterns of worship and traditional games practised in Madhesh. Due to the changing structure of the house, the social connection between people and culture is also disappearing,” he said.However, Engineer Mukesh Dubey of Mahottari disagrees and says that the physical structure of a house has nothing to do with the disappearance of culture and tradition.“At a time when everyone is working very hard for a comfortable life, living in a mud house is a challenge. While the maintenance and upkeep is costly, finding a skilled potter, quality mud, and workers is a headache,” said Dubey. He argues that building a concrete house is a one-time investment and therefore a viable option for most people in Madhesh. “People don’t talk about the danger of snakes, leaking roofs and adverse weather conditions when talking about living in mud houses with clay tile roofing. Concrete houses are simply a safer option.”Giving continuity to the craft is also a challenge in conserving the traditional housing system in Madhesh with the newer generation disinterested in taking up the craft.Teji Pandit of Aurahi Municipality-2, a professional potter, died a couple of years ago. He left behind three sons, but none of them picked up the craft when their father was alive. The oldest son works at the Nepal Electricity Authority, the middle one runs a tea shop and the youngest is in Qatar for employment.According to Jibchhi Pandit, a 70-year-old woman of Aurahi-2, the children of several renowned potters did not learn the traditional skill of pottery. The craft died with the older generation, she says.“Now the children from traditional potter families also buy clay lamps for festivals because they don’t know how to make them,” said Jibchhi. “Everyone has chosen a different vocation from their fathers and forefathers. But you can’t really blame them, can you? The demand for clay tiles and clay products has decreased significantly, so a craftsman can’t survive on their skills anymore. Compared to the past, the earning from pottery work is very low.”","Published at : March 20, 2023",Dhanusha,Santosh Singh

Musahar children in Saptari village are still deprived of education,"Girija Sada Musahar of Maniyar Parsahi settlement, Mahadeva Rural Municipality-4, has a seven-year-old son who has never been to school. The seven-year-old said that he does not go to school because his parents do not send him there.Pawan Sada of the same settlement also has two daughters, one eight years old and the other 10; they also never go to school.Sampait Sada’s son, who is in grade two, also doesn’t go to school. His son said that he doesn’t have the uniform and other materials he needs at school.Even though the local government claims 100 percent enrollment of school-age children in the Mahadeva Rural Municipality, around 200 aged 5 to 10 years in the Maniyar Parsahi Musahar settlement are deprived of education. Some have not been enrolled at school, and even those enrolled do not go to school regularly. Like any other Musahar community, people in this settlement survive by doing menial labour, farm work, and fishing in rivers and ponds.Most of the children of this settlement have not been enrolled in school due to the absence of birth certificates and because their parents don’t have citizenship certificates in the first place. Some don’t go to school because of poverty.“We even struggle to put food on our plates. In such conditions, how can we provide materials necessary for their education?” said Brihaspati Sada of Maniyar Parsahi. There are around 250 children in the settlement. Most of them can’t even afford government-run schools that only collect nominal charges from students.“The school, the local government, and the parents are all to blame for the Musahar children not attending school,” he added.“My son also stopped going to the school after he was kicked out for not attending his exam. They say he can only go to school in the new academic session,” said another local, Lalo Devi Sada. Children in this settlement cannot even spell or write their own names or the names of their schools. “We don’t know if this is a weakness of our children or the school’s,” she added.“We stopped sending my seventh-grade son to school because he couldn’t write anyone’s name. We thought we were wasting our resources by sending him to school,” said Ashok Sada, a local.“Children of this settlement are mostly found playing cards, playing marvels, and fishing, among other things, during the day. All the parents in the settlement leave for work at 7 in the morning and only return home at 9 pm every day. With such a busy schedule and little money, how can we manage to send our children to school? There is no progress between the children who go to school and those who don’t. They haven’t learned anything,” he added.The nearest school is Dwarika, Shreelal, Satandevi Secondary School in Bathnath, which is 1.5 km away from the settlement, and some of the children of this settlement go to this school.“Our children face hardships even after being admitted to school,” said Raijani Devi Sada. “After two or four days at school, they don’t want to go because the students and teachers treat them unfairly for being Dalits,” she added.According to Yuddha Narayan Yadav, principal of Dwarika, Shreelal, Satandevi Secondary School, the children from Maniyar Parsahi are not regular at school.“The parents in this settlement do not pay attention to their children’s education. Sometimes the teachers also scare the children saying that they will be kicked out of school if they are not regular. So the students stop coming to school,” said Yadav.“Not only the children of this Musahar community but other children too don’t come to school regularly. About 40 percent of them do not come to school regularly,” he added. There are nearly 900 students at the school, 150 of them from various Musahar settlements.Despite the absentees, the municipality still claims 100 percent enrolment.According to Dev Kumar Yadav, head of the education unit of the Mahadeva Rural Municipality, all the children of the school age are enrolled. The federal government allocated Rs65 million under the conditional grant, and the municipality allocated Rs6.9 million to education.“We have been offering scholarships and mid-day meals to bring dalit students to school,” he said.","Published at : March 2, 2023",Saptari,Abdhesh Kumar Jha

Court hands down jail sentence to three convicted in murder of environment activist Dilip Mahato,"The Dhanusha District Court on Friday handed down a 25-year jail term to two persons convicted of murdering environment activist Dilip Kumar Mahato of Dhanusha.A bench of Judge Chitra Bahadur Gurung sentenced Bipin Mahato and Munindra Mahato to 25 years in prison and slapped a fine of Rs500,000 each.The court also sentenced Jitendra Mahato to 12 years in prison, a fine of Rs250,000 and ordered him to pay Rs200,000 in compensation to the victim’s family.Bipin and Munindra were charged with intent to kill, while Jitendra was named as complicit in the crime.The court on February 16 had convicted them of murdering Mahato. The court, however, had given a clean chit to crusher operator Binod Mahato, and workers Satya Narayan Mahato, Shatrudhan Mahato, and Roshan Kumar Mahato who were also accused in the case. Twenty-four-year-old Mahato, who had been protesting against the illegal mining of Aurahi riverbed material for two years, was dragged and killed by a tipper truck in the wee hours on January 10, 2020.Dilip had returned home only two weeks ago from Bhopal in India, where he was pursuing a bachelor of engineering degree. Dilip was in the last semester of his course and about to graduate. From the very beginning, Dilip had argued that harvesting the river of its sand, stones and boulders would place his village at risk of flooding. Dilip’s relatives had said he was repeatedly threatened but he took it lightly.Following the incident, police had remanded four of the alleged perpetrators of the tipper attack in judicial custody for five days. The Dhanusha District Court had issued the order to keep the accused—Bipin Mahato, Munindra Mahato, Jitendra Mahato and Roshan Kumar Yadav—in custody pending a police investigation.","Published at : February 24, 2023",Kathmandu,Post Report

Lack of citizenship pushes Musahars deep into poverty,"Forty-eight-year-old Shankar Sadaya lives in Shobhapur, a Musahar settlement in Lahan Municipality-18, Siraha. Most people in the settlement, including his family of five, have been deprived of basic government services for the lack of citizenship certificate.“All five members of my family are above 16 years of age but we haven’t been able to acquire citizenship certificates,” said Shankar. “Because of that, my children were deprived of education. None of my children has birth certificates so the local school denied them admission when they were of school-going age.” There are 40 households in Shobhapur, and more than 50 people above the age of 16 do not have citizenship certificates.The lack of citizenship has also affected the elderly population in the settlement since they haven’t been able to benefit from government schemes such as the elderly allowance.Under the cash scheme, the government provides Rs4,000 per month to those above 68 years of age and the same amount to those above the age of 60 years from the Dailt community and to single women.Somni Musahar, 63, has spent her entire life doing menial labour. When she turned 60, she had hoped her burden would lessen with the help of the government allowance. But since she doesn’t have a citizenship certificate, she has never once received the benefit.“I heard that the government gives allowances to the elderly so they don’t have to be dependent on others. To access the fund, I need a citizenship certificate and I have tried getting one, but the government officials turn me away saying I don’t have the necessary documents to make my citizenship certificate,” said Somni. According to her, in the last three years, she has visited the ward office and the district administration office several times but hasn’t been able to acquire her citizenship certificate. “I thought the government’s job was to solve the problems of the people, but our government is bent on making things more difficult for poor people like us,” she said. “Our children are uneducated, and we have to live on someone else’s land. I don’t understand why the government does not consider us citizens.” There are 40 households in Shobhapur, and more than 50 people above the age of 16 do not have citizenship certificates. Bharat Jargha Magar/TKPThe lack of a citizenship certificate has affected every member of the Musahar community living in various settlements in Siraha. From the elderly to children to the youth, every Musahar is living a hopeless reality, says 22-year-old Ajay Musahar, who lives in Shobhapur.“I want to build a house and for that I need to own a piece of land. But since I don’t have a citizenship certificate, I haven’t been able to realise my dream of living in my own house,” said Ajay. “The land where my family currently lives is not in our name so we can’t build a permanent structure like a house there,” he said. “The landowner will object and kick us out.” Ajay has been working as a daily wage earner since he was a child and has saved some money. He wants to build a secure future for himself and his family with his hard-earned money, but his options are few and far between. “I want to go on foreign employment with the money I have saved up but that option is not open to me because I don’t have the required paperwork,” he said. “My hope of working my way out of generational poverty is waning. The government has done nothing for us and does not understand our problem.”The Lahan Municipality says despite their intentions to provide the Musahar community with land plots they haven’t been able to do so since a majority of Musahars do not have citizenship certificates.According to Ramesh Gautam, spokesperson of Lahan Municipality and chairman of ward No 6, the National Land Commission has approved their request to provide land to the landless squatters living in the municipality, and they have started taking applications from them. But the Musahars are not among the beneficiaries.“There are several landless squatters from different communities living in different parts of the municipality. We are providing them with land plots so they can build houses,” said Gautam. “But in the case of the Musahar community, where most of them don’t have citizen certificates, we haven’t been able to find a solution. We can’t transfer land to their names without proof of their citizenship.” According to the 2011 national census, the total population of the Musahar community in Nepal stood at 2,34,490 with 39,929 of them living in Siraha. The Musahar Association of Sihara says out of the total population of Musahars in Sihara, 95 percent are landless squatters.Musahars mostly live on public lands such as the banks of rivers, ponds, and roadsides. Traditionally they do menial labour work in other people’s fields. The lack of a citizenship certificate has affected every member of the Musahar community living in various settlements in Siraha.  Bharat Jargha Magar/TKPAccording to Ramswarup Sadaya Musahar, a leader of the Musahar community and a rights activist, most members of his community do not have citizenship certificates because of low awareness of government procedures and frequent migration. Sukan Sadaya, a 70-year-old man lives in the Itatar settlement in Aurahi Rural Municipality-4. His settlement is spread on the banks of a pond. According to Sukun, his family has been living there for more than four generations. There are 66 households in the Itatar settlement with a population of more than 700 people. Most have been living there for decades but none of them has land ownership certificates. “Four generations ago, the settlement had enough space for all of us. But over time our population has increased and the available space is not enough to accommodate all of us,” said Sukan. “People are struggling to live in such congestion. We can’t even move elsewhere because we don’t have citizenship certificates to be able to buy property.” In the Musahar settlement of Katti Tol in Bariyarpatti Rural Municipality-3, there are 50 households living on the shores of a pond. “I started living in this place four generations ago, and till now I haven't got a land ownership certificate. The negligence of the government and other authorities has made the life of the Musahar people more difficult than before. Now in the modern age where education and assets are highly valued, our community has become more vulnerable and backward,” said Jogendra Sadaya, a 58-year-old man of Katti Tol.A citizenship certificate is necessary for the identification of a person. One can be deprived of government’s services and benefits, education, employment, and land ownership certificates for lacking a citizenship certificate.Sita Ram Sadaya, a 61-year-old man from Bhadaiya in Lahan Municipality-18, is a father of two sons and a daughter. All of his children are above the age of 16 and none of them has a citizen certificate.“I tried several times to get citizenship certificates for myself and my children, but the officials sent me away,” said Sita Ram. “Most Musahars have stopped trying to acquire their citizenship certificates after being rejected by the administration office multiple times under various pretexts.” Ram Swarup, the rights activist, says that a majority of Musahars are deprived of all essential services and benefits such as education, allowance, voting, and medical treatment in the absence of their citizenship certificates. “The government is not unaware of the situation of the Musahar people, but they have done little to solve the problems,” he said. “We have started an initiative by talking to the local units of Siraha to help the Musahars to acquire citizenship, but we haven’t heard from them.”","Published at : February 2, 2023",Siraha,Bharat Jargha Magar

Janakpur youths found murdered in India,"The bodies of two youths—Bishnu Sah and Rohit Sah—from Janakpur Sub-Metropolitan City were found buried in a bordering Indian village on Sunday. The duo was kidnapped by an unknown group sometime in the second week of January, said police. For Ram Babu Sah and his family, the last few days have been difficult. They have been running around to arrange for Rs2 million to pay an unknown group of men who made a ransom call to them on January 13 claiming to have kidnapped Ram Babu’s son, Bishnu, and his friend and neighbour, Rohit.Bishnu’s grandfather, 65-year-old Ram Kishor Sah, cannot bring himself to believe that he will not see his grandson alive. “They had asked for Rs5 million. After borrowing loans from relatives and friends, we somehow managed to collect Rs2 million for the ransom. My son talked them into reducing the ransom and they had agreed,” said Ram Kishor.“The money is still in my bag, but it’s not going to bring my grandson back. What kind of people would do such a thing to another person?” Ram Kishor added. “Bishnu has a young wife at home and a three-year-old daughter. We don’t know why any of this has happened.”According to Deputy Superintendent Deepak Raya at the Dhanusha District Police Office, the bodies of 22-year-old Rohit and 23-year-old Bishnu were found buried in Parsa village, which falls under the jurisdiction of Bela police station at Sitamarhi district in Bihar, India.The family of the deceased reached the incident site and identified the bodies, police said, adding that the bodies will be sent to Nepal by Sunday night after completing the autopsy in India.

Madhesh’s only juvenile reform centre overcrowded,"The only juvenile reform centre in Madhesh has become overcrowded and is currently holding twice its capacity. There are currently 128 children and teenagers kept in the centre in Birgunj, Parsa with a capacity of holding 60 juvenile delinquents.The centre, which is spread across an area of approximately 507.94 sq m (1.5 kattha), has 11 rooms. According to Tika Krishna Kafle, chief of the centre, ten of the rooms are small and each room is shared by 10 children while the only big room is shared by 20 children.Limited rooms and resources have created problems in managing the centre, says Kafle.“We are having various problems in the management of the children. In colder months, we somehow manage but we have to deal with the spread of communicable diseases among the children living in close quarters,” said Kafle. “Even now, children are falling sick every day with cold and fever.” According to him, there is only one nurse deployed to the centre. “The nurse can’t attend to all the sick children. So we have to take them to the hospital. But the Ministry of Women, Children and Social Welfare has not even arranged for transportation for us to take patients to the hospital.”The reform centre in Birgunj receives juvenile delinquents from all across the province. Out of the 128 children and teenagers, nine are Indian nationals, said Kafle.According to Kafle, out of a total 128, only one and a half dozen cases have received verdicts from the court so far. Although there is a provision in the Children’s Act 2075 that children’s cases should be decided within 120 days, it takes years for the courts to issue verdict which leads to overcrowding at the centre, according to Kafle.“Juvenile Reform Centres in Kathmandu and Pokhara are well-equipped,” Kafle said. “They have schools and even a hospital on the premises but here in Parsa, there are none.”","Published at : January 19, 2023",Parsa,Shankar Acharya

Student dies after accidentally drinking chemical spirit at school,"The locals of Mirchaiya of Siraha district obstructed the Mirchaiya section of the East-West Highway on Sunday following the death of a 16-year-old student of Sagarmatha Higher Secondary School on Saturday.Srijana Kumari Mahara, an eighth grader, had fallen ill on Friday after accidentally consuming chemical spirit (isopropyl alcohol) at school.According to the police, Srijana died while undergoing treatment at the Karjanha-based Phul Kumari Mahato Memorial Hospital. Students and the locals have demanded legal action against the school for being negligent.The protest along the East-West Highway intensified and the police fired 12 rounds of bullets into the air and 15 shells of teargas to control the crowd, informed Deputy Superintendent of Police Hari Bahadur Wali of the Area Police Office, Mirchaiya. Five security personnel were injured while attempting to clear the obstruction from the highway, said Wali. On Friday, Srijana complained of period pain. A teacher at the school gave her a pain-relief tablet. Mahara picked up a bottle containing the chemical spirit, mistaking it for drinking water, and ingested the tablet. The chemical spirit is used in the classrooms to clean whiteboards. The school’s founder principal Pradeep Tiwari had ignored the student’s complaint of pain after consuming the chemical, and had dropped her home instead of taking her to a health facility for treatment, said Dharmendra Mahara, the victim’s father.“The principal told us that our daughter had consumed spirit but would be fine after resting for a while,” said Mahara. “We believed him, but her condition only worsened.”Mahara has filed a complaint at the Area Police Office demanding action against the school administration, stating that he lost his daughter due to the school's negligence.According to Dr Shyam Kumar Shah, who treated Srijana, the victim’s lungs were already damaged when she was admitted to the hospital. Shah said the victim lost her life due to a lack of oxygen. “The victim’s lungs had turned white, the X-ray showed,” Shah informed. “The cause for the whitening of the lungs will only be known once the forensic results come in.”An investigation is underway to find out how a bottle containing a chemical spirit got into the hands of the victim while she was trying to drink water, said Wali. Wali said the school has admitted that the incident occurred during school hours and the teacher, who had given the medicine to Srijana, and the school principal Tiwari, have been taken into police custody for further investigation.","Published at : January 8, 2023",Siraha,Bharat Jarghamagar

Cold waves throw life out of gear in several districts across Tarai,"Cold waves over the past few days have greatly affected daily life in several Tarai districts of Madhesh Province. Several local units decided to close schools as the temperature started plummeting in the region. On Tuesday, most of the flights to and from Janakpur, Simara and Rajbiraj were cancelled due to poor visibility caused by thick fog.According to the Provincial Police Office in Janakpur, five people—four in Sarlahi and one in Saptari—died due to severe cold in the past three weeks. People from impoverished communities, elderly people and children are hit hard by the increasingly cold weather in the area.“I cannot go outside the house to find work due to the bone-chilling cold. I have problems managing food for my children and keeping them warm,” said Shanti Majhi of Kabilasi Municipality-7 in Sarlahi district. Majhi, who ekes out a living as a daily wage earner, does not have enough food grains and warm clothes to see him through the winter.People of Musahar, Dom and Chamar communities are hugely affected due to the cold wave. Many of them do not have warm bedding materials. They have been using straws and jute sacks to keep themselves warm. “The straws used as bedding get damp. We have not been able to dry them out for a lack of sunshine for days,” said Marani Devi Majhi, another local of Kabilasi-7.Cold wave is a weather condition with a rapid fall in temperature due to a lack of sunshine, thick fog and cold wind. Districts across the Tarai region are affected by the phenomenon every year.Sarlahi and other districts have not seen sunshine for the past three days. Human activities decreased significantly in the streets and marketplaces as people remain confined inside their houses.Several local units in Madhesh started closing schools to save children from severe cold. Birgunj Metropolitan City decided to close schools for four days starting from Tuesday due to the cold. The metropolis office on Monday issued a notice directing all the schools to close their classes up to Friday. The metropolis distributed firewood to make bonfires in major market junctions while various social organisations distributed warm clothes to the homeless.Meanwhile, cases of cold-related diseases including pneumonia are surging in Rautahat district. According to Subas Chaudhary, a doctor at Chandrapur Hospital in Rautahat, four to five children suffering from pneumonia have been visiting the hospital daily for the past few days. “Children, elderly people and people with chronic diseases have been affected hugely. We suggest people stay indoors and keep themselves warm,” said Chaudhary.The provincial assembly members drew the attention of the provincial government to take prompt initiatives to protect people from the cold wave. Speaking at the provincial assembly meeting on Tuesday, the people’s representatives demanded the distribution of warm clothes and relief to the needy.According to the data available at the Meteorological Forecasting Division, maximum and minimum temperatures in Janakpur were recorded at 16 degree Celsius and 12.6 degree Celsius, respectively, on Tuesday.

Forest guards beat up three women for entering forest to collect grass,"Three women from Kolhabi Municipality-8 in Bara were brutally beaten by forest guards on Sunday. The women had entered the Madhuban Forest to collect grass for fodder.30-year-old Harka Maya Khadka, 28-year-old Hem Kumari Shrestha and 33-year-old Sita Shrestha have accused five forest guards of manhandling them and beating them. On Monday, the victims’ families and locals protested outside the District Police Office and the District Administration Office in Kalaiya demanding action against the guards.“We had gone to cut grass in the forest two kilometres from our settlement, Naya Basti,” Harka Maya told the Post. “When the forest guards found us, they started attacking me.”“I was brutally beaten for entering the forest,” said Harka Maya. “My friends—Hem Kumari and Sita—came to save me. They too were beaten by the guards.”The District Forest Office admits that the guards beat up the women on Sunday for entering the forest. “The locals are banned from entering the forest area but the three women did not comply with the rules. They were caught cutting saplings inside the forest,” Binod Singh, chief of the district forest office, told the Post.According to Harka Maya, when the victims approached the Area Police Office in Kolhabi to file an FIR, the police refused to lodge the FIR. “They instead asked us to settle the matter amicably with the forest administration. That’s why we had to go to Kalaiya to protest in front of the authorities,” she said.The District Forest Office and the local administration have, however, only promised to take departmental action against the forest guards. “But we want the police to initiate legal action against the guards for the physical abuse they inflicted on us,” she said. “We want to file an FIR for an attempt to murder charge against the guards but the police say that the case is that of harassment.”Anup Subedi, ward chair of Kolhabi-8, said that he is aware of the Sunday incident. The guards used batons to beat up the women, he said. “They have suffered injuries from the beating. The police must take action against the guards.”According to him, the forest guards were from the Forest Sector Unit Office located north of Bodhban Machhagaon, which falls under the Madhuban Forest Sector Office in Ward 5.“The victims told me that the forest guards were in a group of five—three in civil dress with a face cover and two in uniform,” Subedi said. “Those in civil dress were forest guards Ram Tapasya Sah, Pradeep Sharma and Dhal Bahadur Karki. They were the ones who manhandled the women.”The guards fled the incident site soon after, he added.Singh, chief of the district forest office, says that the guards resorted to physical abuse because the women were flouting the rules. “The guards have made a mistake. I have recommended departmental action against them.”","Published at : January 3, 2023",Bara,Laxmi Sah
Jayanagar-Kurtha trains will keep rolling for now,"The Nepal Railway Company (NRC) that runs the Jayanagar-Kurtha cross-border railway has agreed to a temporary arrangement with India’s Konkan Railways Corporation Limited (KRCL) to continue operating the country’s sole railway service.Officials said a commercial contract with the KRCL has been renewed for a month, subject to three months’ extension, by when they expect to find a more permanent alternative. “We have decided to extend the KRCL contract by a month,” said Balaram Mishra, chief administrator of the Department of Railways. “We have sent a financial proposal to the KRCL, asking it to reduce its service charge so that we can extend the commercial contract. Had the extension not been made, the country’s sole cross-border railway could have halted operation as the original contract was valid only until December 26.”The railway had come into operation from April 2022 when it was jointly flagged off by then Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It was considered a milestone in strengthening cross-border connectivity between Nepal and India. Officials said that they expect the KRCL to reduce its fees. The railway is running at a loss and the finance ministry is also not helping. “We have not received even a single penny in the past 18 months,” Niramjan Jha, general manager of the Nepal Railway Company, said. “So we are requesting the KRCL to reduce its fees.” “If the KRCL is ready to restructure the fees, we will extend the contract by three months. We are also thinking of operating the rail by striking a service contract with other Indian rail operators and individuals,” said Jha. The KRCL has been helping the NRC run rail operations for the past nine months. As the KRCL’s commercial contract is expensive and both Indian and Nepali sides are planning to operate the rail line up to Bijualpura, Nepal needs more technical manpower. “We know carrying passengers does not make profit,” said Jha. “To earn money, we have to focus on freight service.” The length of the railway from Jayanagar to Bijalpura will be 52 km, according to officials. The Jayanagar-Kurtha-Bijalpura-Bardibas railway is one of the five cross-border links being planned between Nepal and India. Besides this, India has already expressed its commitment to extending cross-border rail to Kakarbhitta, Biratnagar, Janakpur, Bhairahawa, and Nepalgunj by linking them to the closest Indian railway stations. Work is underway for laying another new railway line from Raxaul to Kathmandu. Besides the Jayanagar-Kurtha-Bijalpura railway link, India is working on expanding another railway from Biratnagar to Bathnaha (India), which will be about 18 km. According to officials, before formal resumption of the newly expanded railway service, the two sides will complete technical work, including test drive, speed trial, and track inspection.“Without money, you can only imagine how we operated for the past 18 months. We have not received a single penny for the operation of this cross-border railway. We have requested the finance ministry to release funds several times but they don’t listen to us,” complained Jha.The KRCL has been providing 28 different railway techniciansincluding engine drivers whom the local railway administration has had to offer hefty perks and salaries.As the Nepali side does not have adequate technical manpower tooperate the railway, the local authority has been handling onlygroundwork and staff management and relying on the Indian firm for the rest. In terms of connectivity, this is Nepal's first cross-border broad gauge railroad and the first rail link between the two countries to be operationalized since the rail services were halted in 2014 for infrastructure-upgrade. As of now, the chances of Nepal bringing Indian railway technicians are slim for a variety of reasons. But if the train services were to be halted, people-to-people connectivity between India and Nepal would be severely affected. In June 2022, India's ""Bharat Gaurav Train"" on the Ramayana circuit brought over 500 Indian tourists to the Janakpurdham station, utilizing the newly inaugurated rail-link. Further, as the project was built with technical and financial assistance of the government of India worth some 5.50 billion Indian rupees and as the rail link was inaugurated by the prime ministers of the two countries, rail operations may feature prominently in future bilateral discussions.Already, India has highlighted, through official channels, severe manpower and security-related issues in the operationalisation of the rail link to Nepal. Even prior to the inauguration, there was a concern over lack of availability of ground manpower in Nepal and that had delayed the project’s operationalization. Two Diesel Electrical Multiple Unit rakes were procured from India in September 2020. “I would like to reiterate that we are facing an acute shortage of funds as well as technical and trained manpower,” said Jha. “If we can arrange for those, we are sure to make a profit.”","Published at : January 3, 2023",Kathmandu,Post Report

Birgunj Prison lacks treatment facility for inmates,"The lack of a medical centre on the premises of Birgunj Prison has deprived the prisoners of immediate medical care when needed.The prison currently holds more than 1,200 prisoners, according to the data of the prison administration. Cases of minor health issues among the patients are reported daily but since there is no health centre on the prison premises, the patients are taken to Narayani Hospital for treatment. However, if a patient is in need of immediate care, delay in taking him to the hospital often leads to his worsening health condition and in some cases even death.“In July 2018, 74-year-old inmate Dipan Shah fell ill. Shah, a chronic patient with high blood pressure and asthma, died on his way to a hospital,” said Ashok Kumar Baidya, former president of Birgunj Chamber of Commerce and Industries.Baidya was also a member of Hanumani Devi Nathamal Baidya Sewa Samiti Birgunj, a non-profit organisation, which had handed over a two-room building inside the prison premises meant to be used as an infirmary for inmates eight years ago.“The building was constructed by the Hanumani Devi Nathamal Baidya Sewa Samiti. We had set up a fully-equipped infirmary for the prisoners. We handed over the infirmary to the prison administration on March 14, 2015,” said Baidya. “But the building is being used by the prison administration as living quarters for the security personnel.” Section 16 of the Prisons Act 2022, which took effect on November 26, states unequivocally that any prison with more than 500 inmates must have a fully-equipped hospital, and any prison with fewer than 500 inmates must have a health post. Birgunj Prison has neither.When the donor group handed over the health centre building, they also provided beds and essential health equipment. The equipment lies unused while the beds are being used by the security personnel. The lack of a treatment facility has not only posed problems for the inmates but also inconvenienced the prison administration since a large number of security personnel need to be deployed to escort a patient to hospital.Madan Ghimire, the jailer, says despite the problems faced by both prisoners and the prison administration, they have no option but to use the infirmary as living quarters for security personnel. “We have limited space. We can’t accommodate the number of security personnel we have,” said Ghimire. “We were short-staffed earlier and we couldn’t bring more security personnel because of a lack of space. That’s why we have to use the infirmary as living quarters.”The prison administration, however, is planning to bring the infirmary into operation by making alternate arrangements to house the security personnel. DSP Dipak Giri, spokesperson for the District Police Office, said it is the responsibility of the prison administration to provide necessary facilities to the security personnel.“They had to use the infirmary because they don’t have space. This has gone on to affect the prisoners. It is time for the authorities to take this matter seriously because it affects both prisoners and security personnel,” said Giri. Baidya from the Hanumani Devi Nathamal Baidya Sewa Samiti Birgunj says the prison administration should ensure the prisoners’ rights are not trampled upon while making considerations for the security personnel.“Our motive was to do something good for the prisoners so they aren’t deprived of medical assistance. I am no authorised person to tell the prison administration how to use the infirmary but they should think about the health of the prisoners because they are also human and they have rights. The law also stipulates a healthcare centre in the prison but it is not being implemented,” said Baidya.","Published at : December 31, 2022",Parsa,Shankar Acharya

"Nepali workers flee Punjab’s rice mill, report death from torturous conditions","Lakhan Ram, a 54-year-old man from Baramajhiya in Kanchanrup Municipality-2 of Saptari, died in a rice mill in Punjab on Sunday. Lakhan’s nephew, Naresh Ram, who also works at the rice mill, said that his uncle had gone to bed around midnight after a long day of intensive work. Lakhan didn’t wake up the next morning.Lakhan claims harsh working conditions and inhumane treatment at the mill led to his uncle’s untimely death. A total of 14 people including Lakhan had gone to Punjab in India in the second week of October to work at Mittal Rice Mill in Samana. According to Naresh, two local men, Laxmi Das and Inarjit Yadav of Kanchanrup took the workers to Punjab assuring them of employment at the rice mill. The workers were promised IRs 10,000 per month as salary. Lured by the prospects of an income, the workers did not think twice before agreeing to leave for Punjab, says Naresh. The working conditions and additional perks and benefits were not discussed.Pankaj Ram, another Nepali worker at the rice mill, says their group of 14 was taken to Nirmali in Bihar through Kunauli where they were made to wait for six days before they left for Punjab.“We were finally taken to Punjab along with 180 Nepali workers brought there from different places,” said Pankaj. “At the rice mill, our job included drying paddy under the sun and storing them in sacks later.”The duty was long, says Pankaj, lasting 18 hours a day. “We were forced to work from 6 in the morning to midnight. The employer’s men gave us some rice and pickles. We would work hungry all day and go to bed hungry.” Pankaj accuses the mill operators of physical abuse and intensive manual labour in difficult conditions. “They would lock us inside a room during the night. They severely thrashed us if we spoke up. We were held hostage inside the mill’s premises and forced to work up to 18 hours a day,” he said.Four out of 14 workers from Baramajhiya fled the mill on the fifth day of starting work. Pankaj, among the first ones to escape, says when other workers tried to escape they were captured and tortured. “We decided to run away at night since we could not bear the torture. We went to another place in Punjab and worked at construction sites. We managed to save IRs 1,000 each so we returned home,” said Pankaj. “Two other workers, Naresh Ram and Niraj Sheikh, also tried to run away but they were caught and taken back.” Naresh says the mill staff thrashed him and Niraj with wood strips for two continuous days. “They threatened to kill us if we tried to escape again,” he said. “We just couldn’t stay there. There was never enough food; the work hours were long and they gave us gunny bags to sleep on. We were being treated like work mules.” The mill operators wanted to cremate Lakhan, Naresh’s uncle, in Punjab itself but Lakhan’s son Badri warned of legal consequences if the mill operators did not release his father’s body to his family. “It was an unnatural death. My father was tortured and kept hungry. The pathetic working conditions led to his death. The contractors who took him and other workers from Nepal should be held accountable to my father’s murder,” said Badri.Naresh and another worker Dev Sundar Ram brought Lakhan’s body home two days ago. According to Dev Sundar, three Nepali workers have been held hostage in the mill. He said the mills have held Niraj Sheikh, Rahim Sheikh and Kisor Ram of Baramajhiya captive.“They want to leave but can’t. They are not allowed to come out of the mill,” said Naresh. Kisor’s health is ill and his condition is worsening with every passing day. “His limbs are swollen and he has been vomiting blood. But the mill operators have denied him medical care,” said Naresh.The family members of Kisor, who Dev Sundar alleges is being confined to the mill, say the operators have not given them access to Kisor. “The mill operators do not let us talk to him over telephone. He hasn’t been allowed to return home. We are deeply worried,” said Kariyahi Devi, Kisor’s wife. “I request the Nepali authorities to intervene and help us rescue Kisor and others from the clutches of the mill operators.”On Wednesday, Lakhan’s family and those of other workers lodged a complaint at the Area Police Office, Kanchanpur demanding their rescue. They have sought strong action against the agents and contractors who lured them into the jobs. They have filed complaints against Laxmi Das of Kanchanrup-3 and Inarjit Yadav of Kanchanrup-9 who took the workers to India.“A complaint was filed with the police. We are inquiring about the incident,” said Deputy Superintendent of Police Naresh Kumar Singh.","Published at : December 30, 2022",Saptari,Abdhesh Kumar Jha

Construction of proposed Bardibas Medical College uncertain,"Infrastructure construction at the proposed Bardibas Medical College has been left in a limbo for the past seven years over land acquisition issues.In 2015, the Council of Ministers had decided to establish a provincial-level medical college—Bardibas Medical College—in Mahottari, a district of Madhesh Province. As per the decision, the construction of the physical infrastructures should be completed by mid-April, 2023. However, the construction work is yet to begin because of a land acquisition dispute.After the Cabinet’s decision, a Detailed Project Report was prepared, proposing the construction of the physical infrastructures of the medical college in around 49 hectares of land belonging to Maisthan Community Forest in Bardibas Municipality-4.According to the medical college infrastructure construction office in Bardibas, the proposed construction site is thinly forested. Debi Subedi, the chief medical college infrastructure construction office, said that the Environment Impact Assessment had also been prepared and submitted to the Division Forest Office in Rautahat.“A writ petition was filed in the Supreme Court recently against the medical college while the federal Ministry of Forest and Environment was preparing to send a file to the Council of Ministers,” Subedi said. “The construction work could not move forward with the writ petition.”The federal government had allocated a budget for the construction of Bardibas Medical College in the fiscal year 2016-17. The medical college infrastructure construction office is without work now.Environment campaigner Devnarayan Mandal filed the writ petition at the apex court stating that the construction of the medical college in the forest land would jeopardise the ecosystem in the area. He demanded to shift the construction site of the medical college elsewhere. “I am not against establishing a medical college. I just don’t want them to encroach the forest land,” said Mandal.The DPR mentions that a total of 1,967 trees need to be cut down for the construction of the physical infrastructures inside Maisthan Community Forest. However, a consultant service company involved in preparing the Initial Environmental Examination says that only 300 to 400 trees should be cut down to construct the infrastructures while other trees could be saved to make a ‘green medical college’.Meanwhile, the locals of Mahottari who have been looking forward to having a medical college within access are disappointed with the uncertainty surrounding the medical college. They say that the construction of the medical college does not stand to “affect the environment” since the proposed site of the medical college has only a few trees.Sanu Purbachhane Magar, a resident of Bardibas-4, says the government should construct the medical college in the proposed location. “In the name of conserving Chure forests, some people and organisations are conspiring against the development of Bardibas,” said Magar, a resident of Bardibas-4. “We will launch a stringent protest if conspiracies are being hatched to shift the proposed medical college outside Bardibas.”A study team chose Bardibas for the construction of the medical college for its location as it is almost in the middle of all eight districts of Madhesh Province. “The project site is suitable,” said Prakash Pokharel, another local of Bardibas. “The locals of the entire province will benefit from the construction of the medical college. The government should construct the college at the proposed site.”The federal government aims to construct the college with a 1000-bed hospital. The total budget for the construction and establishment of the medical college is estimated at Rs30 billion. The government has spent around Rs60 million so far.“It is a misfortune that the government could not initiate the construction of the project which was approved years ago,” said Giriraj Mani Pokharel, the former education minister hailing from Mahottari. “Bardibas Medical College should be constructed in Mahottari because people from across eight districts of the province stand to benefit from its establishment.”","Published at : December 8, 2022",Mahottari,Sunita Baral
Students stage protest against lack of teachers in Mahottari school,"The students of Rastriya Secondary School in Gaushala Municipality of Mahottari district have been protesting against the school and local administrations for failing to provide adequate numbers of teachers.The students took to the streets on Sunday stating that their studies have been affected since the past four months after the municipality removed three teachers in July-August. “Most of our courses have remained incomplete as there are only five teachers for 635 students currently studying at the school,” said Rupesh Kumar Mahato, a tenth-grade student from the school. “Our demand is that the administrators should immediately fill the vacant teaching posts.”The students claim that they resorted to protest as their concerns were ignored even after repeated requests to the school principal, management, and the mayor. “With only a few months to spare for the Secondary Education Examination (SEE), preparations have been hampered since the students are only being taught two-to-three subjects,” said Mahato.According to the students, in an earlier meeting mayor Dipendra Mahato had expressed commitment to resolve the issue after the elections were over but failed to stand by his words. Instead, Mahato ordered the students to not attend school for a week after the students took to the streets to protest, said students and their parents.“The mayor, stating that the students have become undisciplined, has asked us to keep them at home for a week and try to reason with them,” said Rameshwor Mahato, a parent of a ninth-grader Khusbu.Meanwhile, principal Shiva Kumar Yadav said that the school has been making efforts to teach all subjects despite the lack of teachers. “The arrangements for new teachers have been delayed due to the festive-seasons and elections,” said Yadav.Yadav claims that although the students had been asked to stay home after the protests, none had been expelled. He further stated that the mayor has not issued any notice ordering the students to not attend school but had requested the parents to reason with them.","Published at : December 7, 2022",Mahottari,Sunita Baral

Area Police Office building in Thori-2 in dilapidated condition,"Security personnel deployed to the Area Police Office at Thori Rural Municipality-2 in Parsa have been living in deplorable conditions for the lack of a permanent office building.The police operate out of a shaky five-room building. The exterior of the building has cracks and the roof has sunk in. The building provides little to no protection for the 21 personnel stationed there from either security threats or natural elements.The office, built 50 years ago on five bighas of land, was initially used as the army barracks. In February 1996, the barracks came under a heavy attack by Maoist rebels, but the outpost survived. “During the conflict, most police stations and army barracks in rural areas of the district were destroyed by the Maoists, but this office building was defended,” said Prakash Khanal, a 40-year-old local. “After the army left, the building is being used as a police office.”The northwestern part of Parsa falls under the Area Police Office’s jurisdiction but the personnel are not equipped to monitor or provide security to the area, an officer stationed at the police office told the Post on condition of anonymity.“We don’t get any rest or sleep because the building is uninhabitable,” he said. “A couple of years ago the roof was fortified with zinc sheets. That was the only time this police post was renovated.”The officer continued, “It is a nightmare for us to live here. During the summer, we can’t rest for fear of snakes; during the rainy season, the whole building leaks and winters are unbearable here.”According to Chiranjivi Sapkota, a teacher in Thori-2, local residents have the feeling that the authorities have neglected the police outpost.“It is sad to see the condition in which the police live,” Sapkota said. “They are here to protect the area from harm but they are in no condition to serve us. Their living conditions are deplorable.”Thori is near the Nepal-India border and security should be high on priority to monitor cross-border crimes but the police office is not equipped to do that, Sapkota added.In the fiscal year 2014-15, then-home minister Bimalendra Nidhi submitted a memorandum seeking funds to construct a new police station in Thori. The Ministry of Home Affairs set aside Rs8.7 million for the project and invited bids.“At that time, the locals of Thori petitioned the Minister of Home Affairs for the construction of a new area police building and succeeded in getting the budget allocated,” Nidhi said. “But nothing came of it. The tender process collapsed, and the building construction was also postponed in 2017.”Shankar Shrestha, head of the Area Police Office, said that he had already informed the District Police Office about the problems faced by the police personnel. “But I haven't heard anything encouraging from them,” said Shrestha.DSP Deepak Giri, spokesperson of the District Police Office Parsa, said that the necessary correspondence has already been sent to the Police Headquarters for the construction of a new building in Thori. “But I am unaware of the progress on the issue,” he said.","Published at : November 29, 2022",Parsa,Shankar Acharya

"Deprived and repeatedly duped, Musahars are losing faith in state","The huts made with mud, wood, and hay have been raised a little from the ground to ensure safety from the floods that inundate the Musahari tole every monsoon. The tole is a settlement of 22 poor Musahar families with a total of 131 members, and falls in ward 3 of Mukhiyapatti Musaharniya Rural Municipality, which is around 15 kilometres from the Janakpur Sub Metropolitan City. The settlement is spread on around three Kattha land (10,935 square feet approximately).The Musahars have been living in these flimsy huts for generations. And most of the residents do not have land registration certificates for the land their huts occupy. Leaders change. Elections come and go. The only thing that persists is a life full of miseries and stories galore of neglect by political leaders. The top leaders of the major parties have included populist agendas in their election manifestos—Rail and Panijahaj [train and ship] have gotten their place. But neither the local leaders nor the known faces of the top political parties from the region care about the Musahari tole and the problems its residents have faced for generations. The leaders of the political parties have already begun electioneering and they also visit the Musahari tole with their usual tall promises. Are the leaders genuinely bothered or are the Musahars again being seen as no more than vote-banks, the tole residents wonder. Forty-four-year old Birma Devi Sada’s husband died 12 years ago while working in India. Now she lives on the income of her sons who work in the fields on daily wages. There are days they don’t get any work. The Musahars ultimately blame the Nepal government for their sufferings and surmise life would be better if they moved across the border to India. Prakash Chandra Timilsena/TKP She lives in a congested place along with her three daughters and two sons.Come elections, politicians visit us asking for votes, but after getting elected, they forget about us and our plight, she says. “We voted for the umbrella symbol [Rastriya Janata Party-Nepal] and the party also won, but they then didn’t do anything for us,” Sada told the Post.The 22 families share one tube-well for potable water. “But better-off families living nearby got new tubewells under a government grant,” she said.The Musahars do not have access to a toilet. So they defecate in the open in the nearby fields.Sitali Sada, another tole resident, has a hut partitioned into three rooms, shared by her three sons and their wives. The mother sleeps on the tarpaulin-covered porch outside.“Before every election, the leaders always promise to build a house with a bathroom for each of us,” Sitali said. She has difficulty in hearing, but has not sought medical help for the lack of money. “I requested the local leaders for help with treatment, but no one seemed bothered.”All the families cook food outside their huts, with brushwood collected from nearby fields. And collecting fuelwood is not easy. “We get scolded by the owners for trespassing,” Sitali said. The tole is a settlement of 22 poor Musahar families with a total of 131 members, and falls in ward 3 of Mukhiyapatti Musaharniya Rural Municipality, which is around 15 kilometres from the Janakpur Sub Metropolitan City.  Prakash Chandra Timilsena/TKP “Whenever the leaders come to us begging for votes, we ask what they have done for us, to improve our living conditions. They can’t answer and leave,” she added.Disappointed with their elected representatives, the Musahars try new candidates every time, but get duped each time, they say.Shail Devi Sada, 60, has a family of 12 sharing accommodation in two huts. Her sons and their wives sleep inside, but she makes do on the porch outside. On rainy nights, she can’t sleep at all.The Musahars ultimately blame the Nepal government for their sufferings and surmise life would be better if they moved across the border to India.The Indian government helps Dalits by providing them food and proper houses, they said. “What has our government done for us? Absolutely nothing,” they aver. The huts made with mud, wood, and hay have been raised a little from the ground to ensure safety from the floods that inundate the Musahari tole every monsoon.  Prakash Chandra Timilsena/TKP “We re-roofed our thatched huts with tiles, but the tiles have also been damaged by a hailstorm,” said Sitali. “The government has not helped us repair them.”Dukhi Sada, a farm worker, has no time to meet political leaders. “Leaders win, fail to keep their promises, and yet come back to us, trying to trick us every time,” he said. “But our problems remain the same. Our forefathers set up the settlement here by cutting down the forest. But we don’t even have laalpurja [land registration certificate].”Article 40 (5) of the Constitution of Nepal states that the State shall provide land for one time to landless Dalits.But no one is sure when the poor Musahars will get land from the State to legally call their own.Gyan Chand Sada, 70, has some hope that those elected in the November 20 polls will help them build new houses and dig tube-wells. “But we have had a bitter experience. They stop counting us as citizens the moment they win elections,” he says ruefully.","Published at : November 15, 2022",Janakpur,Nishan Khatiwada

"Uniform gives confidence, say women temporary police","On a sunny Friday afternoon, a contingent of temporary police personnel, many of whom were young women, was marching on the side of the road in Chandranigahapur. Smartly turned out in their police uniform, the women constables appeared to be brimming with confidence as many of them have just started on in life.Even though their assignments are temporary since the job is only until the federal and provincial election results are out, they are seen as a precursor to future jobs abroad, mainly in security and local jobs in the army and police.Ashmita Rai, 20, from Bagmati, Rautahat is now posted in Chandranigahapur and lives in her maternal uncle’s house there. Rai’s mother works in Dubai (UAE). Her father does not care about his family and helps economically. “He does not care about us,” she said. She has a younger sister aged 15 and Ashmita is her sole guardian. Ashmita Rai  Prakash Chandra Timilsena/TKP“I don’t want to study further. I completed the SEE during the lockdown. Now I want to help my sister pursue her studies,” she said. They have a house that was built by the government after they were displaced by Bagmati floods, but they don’t have land to grow crops.The police uniform gives her confidence, she said. “Now, I am learning to handle difficult situations.” On learning about her joining the temporary police, her mother said, “Now you will know what real struggle is.”Around 115,000 temporary police personnel have been selected for the elections to the House of Representatives (HoR) and provincial polls slated for November 20.Physically and mentally fit Nepalis aged between 18 and 54 years were selected on the basis of different training criteria from respective district police offices.One of them, Sushila Parajuli, 30, from Jungle Saiya, Rautahat could not study beyond the eighth grade. She is married and has a son. She is habituated to doing daily-wage labor as she and her siblings had helped their family earning Rs100 a day working in a farm until she reached class 8. Sushila Parajuli  Prakash Chandra Timilsena/TKPParajuli also served as temporary police in the local elections in May—the money she received was spent in repaying loans which her husband took to buy Tata magic, a small passenger vehicle. On returning home from Malaysia after developing a backache, he started driving the vehicle. “I always wished to serve my country in a police uniform,” she said. “Now, even if it is a short-term job, I feel proud.” She, however, is curious and a little anxious about where she will be deployed during the elections and what if the area witnesses violence, or whether she will have communication problems due to the language spoken by locals. Although some share concerns like that of Parajuli, others are confident and optimistic that they will overcome all the obstacles. When the team reached the Area Police Office in Hariwan in Sarlahi, the women temporary police were ready for their daily drill. Their voices were loud and crystal clear while performing the drill.

She has passed grade 12 but has no plans to study further. “We don't have our own land for agriculture. So I need to help my family,” she said. Her younger brother goes to school.Her experience working as a temporary police in May’s local polls has boosted her confidence. “I gave my entire salary to my mother to support the family. My father is a farm hand and gets paid only when there is work,” she added. “I was a bit afraid during the local elections, because the job was new, but not anymore.”Laxmi wants to join the Nepal Army, but her relatives advised that she should first gain experience as temporary police.Menuka Kumari Shah from Sugar Factory, Hariwan is 19 and a bachelor's student at Chaturbhuheshwar Janata Multiple Campus. She took the police job so that she could pay her college fee—Rs20,000—and also help the family. “I will continue my studies.”Shah is not worried about where she will be posted on election duty. “We need to perform our duty honestly wherever we are deployed.” Of the total 66,884 applicants in the Madhesh province, 11,827 were women.  Prakash Chandra Timilsena/TKPThere are 84,296 men and 30,642 women deployed as temporary police personnel across the country.Madhesh province has the highest number of temporary police—23,771—while Karnali province has the lowest.Of the total 66,884 applicants in the Madhesh province, 11,827 were women.The temporary police personnel will get Rs 34,760 for a 40-day election duty.

Victims of Madhesh movement left to fend for themselves,"The victims of the Madhesh uprising are languishing in abject penury despite repeated assurances of compensation and rehabilitation by leaders across the political spectrum.They are leading a miserable and painful life—struggling to secure two meals a day. Neither the provincial government nor the Madhesh-based parties, or the major political parties for that matter, have bothered to address their woes.It’s been seven years since the Madhesh uprising of 2015 when many protesters were shot dead, while some others succumbed to their injuries. Still others who were seriously hurt eventually became physically disabled. “Kathmandu has tricked Madhesh. Let’s join the movement for our rights even by risking our lives,” the then chair of the Sadbhawana Party, Rajendra Mahato, announced in the third week of August, 2015 just before the promulgation of the constitution. “If someone is martyred in the process, the government to be formed after the movement will provide Rs5 million to each victim and guarantee free education for their children and employment for their family members.” In their 2017 election manifestos, Mahato’s Rastriya Janata Party and its partner Sanghiya Samajbadi Forum had made similar promises: “The martyrs of the Madhesh uprising will get Rs5 million each. For the injured, we will guarantee the honour of a living martyr, employment, and education for their children.”On the day of the constitution promulgation on September 20, Munsi Patel from Bagahi in Birgunj Municipality-28 was hit by a bullet while protesting near Geeta Mandir in Birgunj. He now is unable to walk or stand—he can only lie down or sit on the bed outside his house.Patel got involved in the movement as he, along with many others, believed the constitution, which was going to be promulgated, had undermined the Madheshi people and their rights. Even though the school was only 50 metres from his home, he could not attend it for want of finances. Financially weak, all four of the family’s sons, including Munsi, became daily-wage labourers. Patel is unaware of his age. When asked how old he is, he just showed his citizenship card. He had three children, but none survived. He even doesn’t remember the date of his marriage. “I got married in the year of the royal massacre in Kathmandu.” On the day of the constitution promulgation on September 20, Munsi Patel from Bagahi in Birgunj Municipality-28 was hit by a bullet while protesting near Geeta Mandir in Birgunj.  Prakash Chandra Timilsena/TKPPatel hopes political leaders would help him lead a normal life and feed his family. He doesn't have the laalpurja [land registration certificate] of his house. His father had purchased a house from a moneylender named Madhav Shah back in 1971, but he is yet to get the laalpurja.When he was shot at, he was first taken to Bir Hospital in Kathmandu, and later shifted to the Sushma Koirala Memorial Hospital. After that, he was brought to the Narayani Hospital in Birgunj and then taken to Delhi for further treatment.Lying in his bed, he recounts the days when he actively participated in the Madhesh protests and the years of his struggle after getting bullet injuries. After seven years of the Madhesh movement and five years of Madheshi parties’ rule in the province, Patel has come to a conclusion, “Leaders only promise, never deliver.”But Patel still hopes that the leaders from Madhesh, who have enjoyed power, will help him build a house for the family: “That is the least they can do.” He said the financial support he got from the government was not adequate. “They provided Rs300,000 twice. The money was spent on repaying loans. Once a loan is paid, another gets added. It would be better if they provided us monthly allowances.” He has been requesting for the same quite a few times, but to no avail.In Patel’s view, the agenda raised by the Madhesh movement is yet to be addressed. “The leaders became ministers, lawmakers and chief ministers, but we are still landless. Even though a government was formed in the Madhesh, it has done nothing for us.”Ranvir Singh Rajput, a resident of Hajminia in Rajdevi Municipality-5, has not been able to work to provide for his family after he was hit by a bullet in the Madhesh movement. His is a family of four—two children besides him and his wife—and he is struggling to run his family household.Before the incident in which he was hit by a bullet at the Ram Krishna Mandir near Nandini hotel, he used to work as a lift operator in India, but now he can’t due to the bullet injury.His wife works at a nearby school named Aadharbhoot Vidyalaya in Harminiya where she earns a monthly salary of Rs 10,000. Ranvir Singh Rajput of Hajminia in Rajdevi Municipality-5 has not been able to work to provide for his family after he was hit by a bullet in the Madhesh movement.  Prakash Chandra Timilsena/TKP“No Madhesh-based party came to my help after I was injured during the Madhesh movement,” said Rajput. He reached out to the local and provincial leaders and even met the chief minister of the Madhesh province. “Once, I didn’t even have enough to feed the family.”He is losing his eyesight and has swelling in his joints. There is also a problem with his digestion. The Madhesh government did not respond to his plea, and none of the provincial leaders sympathised with him, he said. “I am in this pitiful situation because of the Madhesh provincial government. They simply don’t care.”Suffering from extreme hunger, Rajput threatened the provincial government that he would commit suicide. “We don’t have access to the central government. But even the provincial government lent us a deaf ear.”According to Rajput, the Madhesh-based parties do little, and are only good at bargaining for a share in the federal government.Jitendra Prasad Yadav, from Kalaiya-12 of Bara, is now fifth in number in the list of proportional representation (PR) candidates from the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal. He was also badly injured during the 2007 Madhesh movement.That year, he led a protest against the killing of his leader and friend, Majid Miya, in the Madhesh uprising a day before. The administration had imposed a curfew at the time. They defied the curfew and performed Miya’s cremation rites. While they were returning home after doing so, they clashed with the police.The police started firing and he got hit by a bullet. Yadav’s urine bladder burst. He now limps while walking and takes painkillers to ease the constant pain. Jitendra's urine bladder burst after a bullet fired by the police hit him during the movement. He now limps while walking and takes painkillers to ease the constant pain.  Prakash Chandra Timilsena/TKP“Though the party leaders say I am a living martyr, neither the state nor the party has supported me financially or provided me any benefits,” Yadav said. “I also suspect that the inclusion of my name in the proportional representation list is merely a lollipop that I will never get to taste.”Not all those who were injured by bullets in the Madhesh uprising returned home alive. On the same day Munsi Patel was injured, 20-year-old Satrughan Patel from Pakaha Mainpur also received a bullet near the Geeta Mandir in Birgunj. He did not survive.Patel had just returned from Delhi when he joined his local friends in the protests.“We got a call from his mobile. He was taken to the hospital. But he died before he could be treated,” his mother Kusumidevi recalls.Two years after Patel’s death, the Sanghiya Samajbadi Forum made Patel’s mother, Kusumidevi, a candidate for the deputy chair of a rural municipality in the 2017 local polls. She got elected but her role was limited to doing formalities. She was not given any meaningful work by the rural municipality chair. “They had made me a candidate only to cash in on the public sympathy for the mother of a martyr,” said Kusumidevi. Kusumidevi Patel, mother of Satrughan, who died in Madhesh uprising of 2015. Prakash Chandra Timilsena/TKPAfter she was left out of the decision-making process, she had complained about it with party chair Upendra Yadav, then led a group of protestors against the rural municipality chair Vijaya Chaurasiya, before registering a case at the court. Nothing worked. She lost. Now she concludes, “Yi Rajanity Ham Naakaresakem.” (“Politics is not my cup of tea.”)She is now fed up with politics. She played no part in the last local polls nor is she now engaged in any electioneering.Lalbabu Patel from Tikuliya in Gaur Municipality-4 was injured in the Madhesh movement. In return, the government provided him with a water buffalo. He was frustrated with the corruption even in water buffalo distribution. “The buffaloes were given to us and they made a bill [invoice] of Rs175,000 for each animal,” he said. But they were so weak that he could sell his for only Rs50,000, while others could get no more than Rs25,000.Patel was hit in the spinal cord in Gaur violence on September 13, 2015. He was treated in Birgunj, Kathmandu, and Delhi. He is still incapable of sitting up and working.The Madhesh province government, however, claims that they have adequately compensated the victims of the Madhesh uprising.Internal Affairs and Information Minister of the Madhesh Province Bharat Shah said, “It is human nature to be never satisfied.” He claimed the government had helped treat the injured and to provide skill-training to the family of the martyrs. “If they need any more assistance, we are ready for that as well.”Federal government officials also claim to be sensitive to the needs of the Madhesh uprising’s injured and martyrs’ families. “We have provided an equal amount of financial assistance, that is Rs1 million each, for the families of those martyred during the Madhesh movement as well as the Jana Andolan [April 2006 movement],” said spokesperson of the Home Ministry, Phadindra Mani Pokharel.  Prakash Chandra Timilsena/TKPThe two Madhesh-based parties—Rastriya Janata Party and Sanghiya Samajbadi Party—had fought the 2017 elections together in the Madhesh province.They won 19 federal seats—compared to 13 by Nepali Congress, Maoists and the UML combined.They dominated the provincial elections too, winning 44 seats and forming the provincial government.In the past seven years, the Madhesh-based parties went through several splits and mergers and are now largely represented by the Janata Samajbadi Party and the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party.But they failed to do justice to the movement’s victims.“In every political movement, the poor are at the forefront, and in clashes, they mostly become victims. Compensating and helping them has never been any party’s priority,” said Tula Narayan Shah, a political analyst and a close observer of Madhesh politics.The Madhesh-based parties had gotten votes by promising to provide compensation, free education, and jobs to the people in Madhesh. “They have done the movement grave injustice by breaking their promise,” Shah told the Post.","Published at : November 11, 2022",Birgunj,"Nishan Khatiwada						,"
Businessmen in Janakpur stage demonstration against hike in interest rates,"Businessmen in Janakpur have taken to the streets against an increase in interest rates by banks and financial institutions.A group of businessmen led by the Janakpurdham Chamber of Commerce and Industry, protested on Thursday, carrying placards with slogans– “Maintain stable interest rates” and “Limit interest rates to a single digit” among others.They also submitted a memorandum to Madhesh Province Finance Ministry through the Chief District Officer.Jitendra Kumar Mahaseth, president of Janakpurdham Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said they resorted to agitation as the businesses are on the brink of closure as financial institutions have been charging interest rates ""exorbitantly"".Mahaseth said their 12 points demands mentioned in the memorandum include limiting interest rates to a single digit and allowing banks to charge an additional premium as per risks being based on spread rate.Likewise, the demands include making banks roll back the increase in the service fee, loan approval fee and LC negotiation fee to make it the same as the previous year.Of late, businessmen in different parts of the country have staged protests against the banks and financial institutions denouncing an increase in interest rates.Last Friday, demonstrators associated with Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Lalitpur chapters of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, Nepal Wool Felt Producer's and Exporter's Association and Woolen Felt Producers and Exporters Association among others staged a sit-in at Maitighar Mandala in Kathmandu claiming that banks and financial institutions have been charging interest rates exorbitantly.Businessmen said they have been hit hard as banks have increased the interest rates three times in the past year. Banks, however, have been defending the moves saying rising interest rates is a global phenomenon.","Published at : November 10, 2022",Janakpur,Santosh Singh
Voters in Parsa unenthused about provincial candidates,"Political observers have repeatedly warned of how holding the federal and provincial polls together could put the latter in the shadows. No prominent leader wants to contest from the provinces and even if they do, it is alleged, all they want is the chief minister’s seat.The situation in Parsa of Madhesh province is no different. Many people the Post spoke to could quickly tell the names of federal election candidates but were unaware of those contesting provincial assembly seats from their constituencies. When asked about the candidates for the provincial assembly from Parsa constituency-2, 80-years-old Basudev Raya from Bagahi thought deeply for a while but could not say their names. However, he quickly blurted out the names of major candidates for the federal polls. “In our constituency, Ajay Kumar Chaurasiya from the Congress and Surendra Prasad Kurmi from the Janata Samajbadi Party are contesting,” he said with confidence. The Janata Samajbadi Party has forged an alliance with the CPN-UML in the constituency. When the Post asked how he would cast his votes without knowing the names of candidates, Raya replied, ""I will vote for the candidates who my family trusts with bringing development to the constituency.” Ganga Sagar Patel, 28, owns a pharmacy in Pakahamainpur rural municipality. When asked about candidates, he could quickly answer that while Surendra Chaudhary is the candidate of the ruling alliance, the UML-JSP coalition has fielded UML leader Raj Kumar Gupta in the federal polls from constituency 3 (his constituency). But when asked about provincial candidates, he said he needed to look at the official candidate list. Likewise, 26-year-old Radheshyam Patel from constituency-3 who is a driver by profession, also knows the names of federal candidates. “But I can’t remember the names of provincial candidates. Are there candidates for provinces in the constituency? I don’t know,” he added. Lack of knowledge about provincial-level candidates was pervasive and seemed to span caste and gender lines. One such respondent was Radha Devi Yadav, 43, a homemaker from Birgunj Municipality. She too recalled the names of candidates for lower house and also the name of a popular rebel candidate—Ajaya Dwivedi—in her constituency. (Dwivedi was also former president of the District Chapter of the Nepali Congress.) When asked about provincial assembly candidates, she replied, “No I don’t know their names.” Observers say this lack of knowledge about provincial candidates is not without reason. Conducting federal and provincial polls together has undermined the value of the provincial polls and by extension of the provinces, according to Chandra Kishore, a journalist based in Birgunj, who has for long followed Madheshi politics. The local and provincial polls should have been conducted together or the provincial polls should have been conducted separately, he said. ""Now, people don't even know the names of the candidates. Voters have also been confused by alliances among parties with vast ideological differences.” The Madhesh provincial assembly has 107 seats. In the 2017 provincial polls, the Rastriya Janata Party had won 15 seats, Sanghiya Samajbadi Forum 20 seats, the Nepali Congress eight, UML 14, the Maoist Centre six and an independent one seat, under the first-past-the-post election system. Sohan Shah, a commentator on Madhesh politics, said federal candidates are better known because they are established faces. ""Unlike the federal-level candidates, political parties have fielded mostly unknown faces in provincial assembly seats,"" he said.","Published at : November 9, 2022",Birgunj,Nishan Khatiwada
DNA samples of Niharika Rajput’s child and alleged father match,"The DNA samples of Niharika Rajput’s son and Shivaraj Shrestha, the man Rajput has accused of repeatedly raping and impregnating her, have matched, according to the Janakpur High Court.Khadgaraj Adhikari, registrar of the Janakpur High Court said the result of the DNA test report was submitted to the court on Friday. “Niharika’s case will be reopened on November 11. However, since most of the employees of the courts are deployed on election duty, the case may be heard after November 20,” said Adhikari.The DNA test was conducted at the Nepal Academy of Science and Technology in Lalitpur on September 9. Last year Rajput’s demand for a DNA test was rejected by the Dhanusha District Court. She had then decided to start a fast-unto-death until her demands were met. Rajput had filed a case at the Dhanusha District Court on March 2, 2020, after she was allegedly raped by Shrestha on October 29, 2019. She gave birth to a baby boy on August 21, 2020.Shrestha, a resident of Kshireshwarnath Municipality-3, Mahendra Nagar, had given a statement in the court saying that Rajput’s accusations were baseless and untrue.The Dhanusha District Court decided that the existing evidence could not establish the charges.The court’s verdict did not come in Rajput’s favour because she had told the court that Shrestha and her relationship was that of a husband and wife, advocate Rinku Kumari Yadav, who fought on behalf of Rajput at the district court, had told the Post in June.Rajput had then appealed the district court’s verdict at the Janakpur High Court on February 27. Then she came to Kathmandu and approached the National Human Rights Commission seeking justice. She, subsequently, started a hunger strike demanding a DNA test, to prove that Shrestha is her baby’s father. She ended her hunger strike after signing a five-point agreement with the Home Ministry.Rajput, whose real name is Sonali Kumari Singh, is from Mahottari in Jaleshwar Municipality-9, had attempted self-immolation in front of the President's office on August 12. She was taken into custody to prevent her from self-harm, said police.On Friday, Rajput, who is in Kathmandu, was detained briefly by the police after she went to the Baluwatar area, where the prime minister’s residence is, to hold a press meet. “No one can protest or gather in a restricted area.

Chhath’s essence is equality but Dalits still left out,"“Come Dom’s daughter, prostrate and bring the offering basket, it is time for ArghyaCome Koiri’s daughter, bring sweet potato, it is time for ArghyaCome Ahir’s daughter, bring the milk, it is time for ArghyaCome Panheri’s daughter, bring the betel nut, it is time for ArghyaCome Mali’s daughter, bring the flowers, it is time for Arghya…”One of the age-old Bhojpuri Chhath folk songs is a call to the community of people across all castes and beliefs in the southern Terai belt to bring their offerings to worship the Sun God. The song beckons devotees to come together to prepare for the worship of the god. Materials such as bamboo firewood and woven baskets used for Arghya—a ritual of offering prayers to the setting and rising sun—are used for prayers. It is customary for members of the Dom, Barai, Suthani Koiri, Mali and Ahir communities, categorised as Dalits, to bring their specialised offering for prayers and celebrations that follow.The fundamental essence of this Chhath song is to bring together all communities including those pushed to the lower strata of society based on their caste. The traditional Chhath songs have different versions sung by different communities in the Terai belt. While the Chhath songs call for equality and impartiality, the lived experiences of those from the Dalit communities are wholly different. Caste-based discrimination is rife in Nepal—from the mountains to the Terai—and never is the bias more visible than during religious festivals.During Chhath, one of the major festivals celebrated in Nepal’s southern plains which concluded on Monday, the devotees pray by the rivers, lakes, ponds and streams. Pilgrims and worshippers pitch huge tents near the places of worship and celebrate the four-day festival. However, for Dalits in Bara, the four-day festival was a stark reminder of the discrimination they have been subjected to for decades. The main bazaar of the historic Simraungadh Municipality in Bara, where devotees from half a dozen villages gathered to celebrate the Chhath festival on the banks of Isra Pond on Sunday, a grand and attractive tent was built for non-Dalit worshippers of all those villages. But separate tents were pitched for those from the Paswan, Domal, Chamar and other very backward Dalit communities underscoring and emboldening the segregation further. “For decades, the Dalits have not been able to celebrate Chhath with the people of the so-called upper castes,” said Advocate Ram Babu Prasad Yadav, a resident of Kachorwa in the municipality. In Ramnagar village in Ward 11 of the municipality, there is only one house belonging to a Dom family. Of around 150 families that reside in the village, the Dom family is the only one that has been celebrating Chhath separately for generations by fashioning their own water source at a separate place. “For four generations, we have been celebrating the Chhath festival separately,” said Arati Mali Dom, a member of the sole Dom family in Ramnagar. “The other communities here do not allow us to pray alongside them.”The four-day festival is dedicated to the Sun God and his wives Usha and Sangya (Sandhya), thanking them for the bountiful earth and praying for the well-being, and prosperity of their loved ones. The rituals of Chhath festival include fasting—even abstaining from drinking water—offering prayers to the setting and rising sun, popularly known as Arghya and offering prasad. The prasad prepared for this auspicious occasion includes fruits and rice pudding.Bhojpuri literature expert Dr Gopal Thakur says that despite the message of equality in the festival, barring Dalit people from the worship areas of non-Dalits highlights the inequality in society.“Chhath is a festival of equality. But what is being practised on the ground goes against the very essence and purpose of the festival,” said Thakur. “Chhath festival precedes caste structures; the songs are a testament to that. The beginning of the festival is marked by the songs that call for unity and equality.”The bamboo firewoods, offering baskets and shovels made by Dalits (Dom community) are some of the essential materials used during Chhath puja but the deeply rooted caste system in Nepal has over the years pushed Dalits to the periphery of such celebrations. Yadav expresses his displeasure over the failure of society to accept the Dalit community even though legally caste-based discrimination is a crime, and socially, immoral.In Kachorwa village in Simraungadh Municipality, there were about 1,000 devotees gathered at the ghats near Dinbandhunath, Parasnath and Aduwa rivers where people from the so-called “upper caste” observed the Chhath fast together in one tent but no one from the Dalit community was allowed inside. The narrative is not limited to only a couple of villages in this particular municipality in this particular district. Dalits in other neighbouring districts are also segregated from the non-Dalits and have been forced to celebrate every Chhath separately for generations.Vice Chairperson of Baragadhi Rural Municipality Lakshmi Devi Rae, a leader of the Dalit community in her area, says that lack of awareness in society is one of the major reasons behind the practice of discrimination.To bring an end to the long-practised discrimination, Thakur says Dalits must be prepared to struggle for equality during Chhath. “Dalits should also be mentally prepared and struggle for equality to celebrate Chhath alongside non-Dalits in future.” In Baragadhi Rural Municipality, the Dalit community that used to celebrate the Chhath festival separately until a few years ago now celebrates together with non-Dalits after a long struggle for equality.“After years of struggle we were finally able to break the tradition of segregation in our community,” said human rights activist Sikendra Paswan. “Now we celebrate Chhath under a single tent.”Paswan says that Dalit communities in other areas should also fight for equality to celebrate Chhath with everyone in the community.Champa Devi Chaudhary, aged 66, from Madhuban, Karahiyamai Rural Municipality-1, says Dalits and non-Dalits performing Chhath puja in separate spaces is not rooted in discriminatory practices but over time the practice took the form of discrimination. “Every community in the Terai has its own native way of observing Chhath. They have their own versions of folk songs too. People offer what their community produces to the Sun God and every community has different offerings. This is how the practice of different communities observing Chhath in separate spaces came about,” she said. “But over the years, the segregation of worshippers has taken a different meaning altogether. It was never meant to be a discriminatory practice. This festival allows every community to create their own ecosystem and provide a helping hand to others.”","Published at : October 31, 2022",Bara,Laxmi Sah

According to him, the villagers lift water from the tube well by using a motor for an hour daily and distribute it to each household equally.The people have been managing the tube well at their own initiative and with their own resources. Until four years ago, they used to lift water for two hours daily. As groundwater depletes, the villagers have had to cut their pumping time.“One can imagine how much water a family gets with the resource lifted just for an hour. The hardship of the locals is inexplicable,” said Shrestha.The local people vented their ire stating that the government authorities and the people’s representatives are indifferent to addressing the longstanding problem of drinking water in Brahmanagar. They complained that they had requested various political parties and their leaders to resolve the chronic problem, but to no avail.“The election fever has gripped the country. Candidates have started visiting our village. We have decided to vote in the upcoming elections for those who address our problem,” said Shrestha. According to him, all the villagers unequivocally raise the issue of drinking water with the candidates and politicians as they come campaigning.Brahmanagar is around 50 km west of Birgunj, the district headquarters of Parsa and the country’s major import hub.“We attempted to construct a tube well a few years ago but we could not find water even 150 metres underground,” said Bharat Bishwakarma, another resident of Brahmanagar.“We are to be pitied to face such a chronic drinking water crisis in the 21st century. And the leaders who were elected through our votes did nothing to resolve our problem,” Bishwakarma vented his anger, charging the leaders and political parties with ignoring their problem.The women, who traditionally perform household chores, are hardest hit by the drinking water crisis. “A household gets one gagri (traditional water pot) of water on a given day. We have to use it for drinking and cooking food,” complained Parbati Shrestha.“We have to use the murky water of the irrigation canal due to the shortage of tap water. There should be at least six taps or hand pumps to supply drinking water to the villagers”.The villagers are dependent on the murky water channelised to the villagers from the nearby Odarkhola stream. “The water in the canal is unusable especially in the rainy season. But we have no alternative to it. The wild animals also frequently damage the canal and muddy the water,” said Bishwakarma.The elected representatives admit that they could not work as expected to resolve the chronic water crisis in Brahmanagar. “A drinking water project is under construction at Sirantol in the settlement with the financial assistance of the provincial government. It aims to install a deep tube well and distribute water by constructing an overhead reserve tank. The drinking water crisis will be resolved with the completion of the project,” said Shambhu Bahadur Khadka, the ward chairman of Thori-3. But the ward chief was quick to add that it would take some months, if not years, to accomplish the water project.","Published at : October 29, 2022",Parsa,Shankar Acharya
Woman allegedly tortured in custody,"A 33-year-old woman, who was detained for investigation into a murder case, was allegedly tortured in police custody in Siraha district. The incident came to light after the victim was taken to Mirchaiya Hospital for treatment on Monday.The Area Police Office in Mirchaiya had on Saturday arrested Jibachhi Devi Sah, a resident of Rampurbirta in Mirchaiya Municipality-1, in connection with the ‘suspicious’ death of her sister-in-law Gubadi Devi Sah, who was found dead in a sugarcane field on September 30.Jabachhi has said the security personnel tortured her severely in custody, forcing her to confess the involvement of herself and her family in the incident.“A male officer severely thrashed me with a pipe and gave me an electric shock,” Jibachhi told human rights activists, media persons and relatives from the hospital on Tuesday. “A female officer hit me on my private parts, forcing me to say that my father-in-law murdered the wowan.”The hospital said there were bruises on her body. Police said she was released on Sunday.“The security personnel can investigate into the murder without any hurdle,” said Debaraj Pokharel, Madhesh Province chief of the Human Rights Alliance. “But the detainee should not be tortured during the investigation. Torturing is against the fundamental rights enshrined in the constitution.”Pokharel demanded a fair probe and action against the guilty.Asked about the incident, Superintendent of Police Arjun Prasad Timalsina was tight-lipped. “Our probe into the incident is ongoing. We can say what actually happened only when the investigation is over,” he said.On Monday, Mirchaiya locals staged demonstrations, demanding stringent action against the guilty personnel. The protesters pelted stones at the Area Police Office and disrupted traffic along the East-West Highway. Security personnel lobbed six teargas canisters and fired two rubber bullets to contain the situation.The protesters stopped their demonstrations after Chief District Officer Lalbabu Kawari and SP Timalsina met the victim’s relatives and assured them of a probe into the incident. A probe committee chaired by Hari Kishwor Chandrabanshi, administrative officer at the Siraha District Administration Office, was formed. The team will submit its report within five days, Kawari said.Incidents of torture and death in custody are frequently reported in Nepal, especially in the Tarai. The incidents, however, are rarely investigated and the rate of conviction is dismal.","Published at : October 19, 2022",Siraha,Bharat Jargha Magar
Death of two tigers in quick succession worries conservationists,"An adult male tiger was found dead at Bagadadob in Paterwa Sugauli Rural Municipality-4, Parsa, on Sunday. Farman Miya, the spokesperson of the Forest Division Office in Parsa, said the big cat might have been dead three or four days ago. “When we discovered it, the carcass had already started decomposing,” Miya said. “Paws of both front legs of the nine feet four inch long tiger were severed off and taken away.”The place where the tiger was found dead is around 300 metres south from a national forest that borders Parsa National Park. The dead tiger is kept at the subdivision forest office in Basantpur and a team of expert technicians from Chitwan National Park conducted a post-mortem on Sunday, according to Miya. “Sample has been taken to Chitwan for a viscera test which will confirm the cause of the death,” Miya said. “It is suspected that the poachers might have poisoned the tiger.”The death follows another incident on October 1 when another tiger was found dead at zero mile of Kathmandu-Nijgadh Expressway near Nijgadh, Bara. After conducting a post-mortem, a team of veterinary doctors and technicians ascertained that the 14-year-old tiger had died due to lack of food and water. They surmised that the old tiger did not eat for about 15 to 20 days.The tiger found dead in Bara sustained injuries in its mouth and other parts of the body. Conservationists suspected that the tiger was quite old and it sustained serious injuries while fighting with other tigers. According to the Parsa National Park, the tiger entered a Nepal Army camp nearby a few hours before its death. The tiger bit and scratched the tyres of vehicles parked in the camp, park officials said.The death of two tigers in quick succession has had conservationists worried.“Huge efforts are being made to conserve tigers which are endangered in the world [the species is listed as ‘Endangered’ in the IUCN Red List],” said Ashok Ram, chief conservation officer at the Parsa National Park. “The frequent death of tigers is quite worrisome.”Ram guessed that the tiger which was found dead on Sunday might have emerged from the national park as the incident site is just seven kilometres from the national park forest. “Both the dead tigers went out of the park forests and reached there through the national forest,” he added.According to the latest tiger census held in 2021, tiger population in Nepal has reached 355, with the country nearly tripling the number in 12 years. In 2010, there were 121 tigers in Nepal. The number had risen to 198 in 2013 and 235 in 2018.According to the latest census, Parsa National Park is home to 41 adult tigers. According to Ram, there were only four tigers in the park in 2010. The number rose to seven in 2013 and 18 in 2018, with the population doubling in just four years.“The number of tigers is increasing with the rise of prey species and thanks to effective conservation programmes,” Ram said. “We are concerned about the recent death of the tigers. We will study about it and take necessary initiatives for tiger conservation.”","Published at : October 18, 2022",Parsa,Shankar Acharya
"In tit-for-tat action, Chief Minister Raut sacks three Congress ministers","A day after Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba fired four ministers of Janata Samajbadi Party, the chief minister in Madhesh Province sacked three ministers of the provincial government representing Nepali Congress on Friday.Chief Minister Lalbabu Raut of Janata Samajbadi Party sacked Ram Saroj Yadav, minister for Physical Infrastructure Development; Om Prakash Sharma, minister for Water Supplies and Energy Development and Birendra Prasad Singh, minister for Women, Children, Youth and Sports. “As per the recommendation of Chief Minister Lalbabu Raut Province Chief Hari Shankar Mishra has relieved three ministers and assigned the duties of the three ministers to Chief Minister Raut,” states a statement issued by the office of the Province Chief.According to Manish Suman, spokesperson of Janata Samajbadi Party, his party has taken a decision to reciprocate the action taken by the ruling coalition on Thursday by removing their ministers in the Madhesh Province.However, the chief minister has not taken any action against the ministers representing the CPN (Unified Socialist) and CPN (Maoist Centre) that are partners in the ruling alliance led by Congress.

Squatters fall victim to elephant attacks,"Dhanmaya Pahari, a 65-year-old resident of Lamaha in Chandrapur Municipality-6, recently took a loan of Rs50,000 to set up a retail shop of daily essentials targeting Dashain.Last Wednesday, she went to the Chandranigahapur market and bought groceries for her shop. Pahari spent the night prepping up her shop, and set up bamboo fences to keep away intruders and wandering animals.At around 2 in the morning, she woke up to loud noises outside. When she looked outside, she saw two elephants raiding her neighbour’s house and people trying to chase the megafauna away.Pahari rushed towards the highway to save her life. Most of the villagers followed her. The elephants were still running amok, destroying the houses, including Dhanmaya’s, and her yet-to-be-opened shop.“It took me a while to process everything happening around me. I started running to save my life, and then I saw a parked gas truck and climbed onto it,” Pahari recalled. “No one returned to the village that night. Most of us lost our homes and some have already left the settlement seeking a safer place. Now I don’t know how I’ll repay my loan.”The villagers returned to the settlement the next morning. They are now appealing to the municipality office to relocate them to a safe space. But their appeals have yet to be heeded, say locals.That night, personnel from the area police office, Chandranigahapur reached Lamaha settlement to chase away the elephants. But by then, the pachyderms had already damaged five houses belonging to Ram Pahari, Laxman Pahari, Phulmaya Magar, Arjun Pahari and Dhanmaya.Dhanmaya, who lost her husband two years ago, says she is now left with little and has nowhere to go. “I have three sons but they live separately,” she said. “After my husband’s death, the house was all that I owned. I thought I would earn some money through the shop but now I don’t even have that.”Today, Lamaha, a squatter settlement of 14 households, is reeling under the shock of the incident and the confusion in its aftermath. Most of the residents have moved near the east-west highway.“The village is virtually empty,” Laxman, who lost his house and crops he had saved for winter in the incident, said. “Most of the villagers are now living by the roadside, nowhere to go.”The residents aren’t indigenous to Lamaha. They migrated here in 1987 after they were removed from Dangdunge village of Makwanpur. Ever since, they have been living in the forest near Lamaha River.Sher Bahadur Pahari, 78, another resident, said they had been living peacefully for 35 years in the settlement surrounded by a dense forest. Nothing catastrophic happened. But the incident on Wednesday night has shaken everyone.“We do not know why the elephants are angry. The attack was terrifying,” Sher Bahadur said. “Many people left their homes due to the fear of elephants. Women and children are seeking refuge with their relatives in other settlements. I do not know how long we will be able to survive without money and food.”Keshar Bam, an employee of the Timber Corporation of Nepal (TCN), who was in the settlement when the elephants wreaked havoc, says there were more than 30 children in the settlement at the time of the incident.“Everyone was running around to get the children to safety,” Bam said. “No one knew what or whom the elephants would attack next.”According to Sanjay Kafle, mayor of Chandranagar, there is no electricity or water supply in the settlement. Efforts are being made to provide relief to those affected by the elephant attack, Kafle said.Kafle added that his office is discussing alternatives for relocating the victims. “This settlement is vulnerable and deprived of services, so it should be relocated permanently,” he said. “It will take some time but we are making efforts.”","Published at : September 24, 2022",Rautahat,Shiva Puri
Violence against LGBTQI+ people continues,"Last Saturday, Munni Kinnar was on her way back home to Dumari from Laxmipur with her friend, Chanda Raut, after visiting her ailing sister. What followed their visit to Laxmipur has scarred the two friends both physically and emotionally. “I am still trying to comprehend what happened to us,” said Munni, who sustained serious injuries from a thrashing she was subjected to by Laxmipur locals.Members of the LGBTIQ+ community, 43-year-old Munni and 47-year-old Chanda, residents of Kalyanpur Municipality in Siraha and Hansapur Municipality of Dhanusha respectively, say the locals of Laxmipur Chowk in Bishnupur Rural Municipality-5, Siraha physically abused the two on suspicions of stealing a newborn. A mob gathered and first verbally abused the duo using indecent language and then proceeded to beat them up indiscriminately. The abuse stopped only after the arrival of the security personnel from the Area Police Office in Bishnupur. The police personnel rescued the duo from the clutches of the unruly mob. But by then Munni had already sustained serious injuries to her body. “The villagers beat us up calling us thieves. They accused us of stealing infants and refused to listen to our pleadings. We told them we are a sexual minority and also members of the Blue Diamond Society but no one listened to us,” said Munni. “It was painful and humiliating to be subjected to abuse like that.”The Blue Diamond Society is Nepal’s oldest LGBTIQ+ rights organisation with branches across the country. Following the incident, Munni filed a complaint with the police seeking justice. Based on the complaint, police detained Madan Mahato of Laxmipur on Tuesday on the charge of physically abusing people from the sexual minority group. According to Deputy Superintendent of Police Subas Budhathoki, who is also the information officer at the District Police Office in Siraha, a complaint of ‘indecent behaviour’ has been filed against Mahato in connection with the incident. “Detailed investigation is underway. We are searching for the other accused involved in the incident,” said Budhathoki.Munni and her group traditionally visit houses where a new baby is born. They celebrate with the family and bless the baby. The family provides them with gifts in cash and kind in a gesture of appreciation. But on Saturday, Munni and Chanda were not out on their jobs. They were visiting a family member. “We never came in touch with a baby that day, let alone steal one,” said Munni. “The locals took offence at us being there at that moment.”In Tarai districts, the practice of inviting members of the sexual minority groups to celebrate the birth of a child is still very much alive. The invitees, who visit the home of the newborn on the sixth day of birth, perform the “pamriya” dance through which they congratulate the new parents and bless the child; recite folk tales and become a part of jubilant celebrations. Of late, rumour has been circulating in several districts about women from India entering Nepal to steal babies. This has led to incidents of violence against women of Madheshi origin, and also members of the LGBTIQ+ community.The Cyber Bureau of Nepal Police on Tuesday dismissed the rumour and issued a public appeal to stop circulating baseless news on social media platforms. For queer community members, violence against the LGBTIQ+ community remains a distressing reality. Lakshmeshwar Prasad Yadav, programme coordinator of the Blue Diamond Society, says that Munni and Chanda faced abuse mostly because they are queer. “The locals found it easier to accuse Munni and Chanda of being thieves because they are queer.” LGBTIQ+ people have been living under threat in the absence of stringent government measures to protect marginalised communities, say queer rights activists. In January 2020, Ajita Bhujel, a transgender, was beaten to death in Hetauda. The body of the 29-year-old was found naked at the local Kyampadanda road. In March 2019, 31-year-old Junu Gurung, a third gender, was found murdered in her apartment at Lazimpat in the Capital. Both incidents were “hate crimes” against the LGBTIQ+ community, say queer rights activists.Peter Rai, a transgender woman working with the Blue Diamond Society, Kathmandu, says Saturday’s episode is also a “hate crime” because the perpetrators had no proof of Munni and Chanda stealing babies. “They were accused in the first place because they are queer,” she said. “The Blue Diamond Society in Janakpur is following up on the issue. This is not an isolated incident. This has happened before to members of our community. It is cruel of people to treat us like we are not humans and ostracise us for our gender and sexual identities.” “The government must formulate new laws and upgrade the existing policies and laws to provide protection to the marginalised and the sexual minorities,” she said.","Published at : September 15, 2022",Siraha,Bharat Jargha Magar
Madhes government members stage sit-in seeking police adjustment,"Madhesh Province Chief Minister Lal Babu Raut along with several cabinet members on Sunday staged a sit-in protest against the federal government demanding immediate adjustment of the police force.The leaders staged the protest outside the official residence of the Province Chief, stating that the federal government has delayed the adjustment and has not handed over the right to the provincial government as enshrined in the constitution.Raut said the delay in implementing the Police Adjustment Act that was endorsed by the President on February 11, 2020 has raised a lot of questions regarding the intention of the federal government. “We cannot imagine a government without a police force. Four years ago we drafted the Police Adjustment Act in an effort to build pressure on the federal government. It’s been two-and-a-half years since the President also endorsed it,” said Raut. “We even drew the attention of the prime minister and top brass of political parties. But since no one is paying heed, we are forced to launch a protest.”Minister for Internal Affairs and Communication Bharat Prasad Sah said that the sit-in is part of the first phase of protests and will go on for a week from 11am to 1pm everyday.Despite the continuous demand by the provincial governments that the police force be adjusted immediately, the federal government has not done so because of which provinces are facing problems.At a press conference in Janakpur on Saturday, the Madhesh government announced a protest against the federal government demanding immediate adjustment of the police force.Meanwhile, the main opposition party Loktantrik Samajbadi Party said that the sit-in staged in Janakpur has no relevance. Loktantrik Samajbadi Party province chair and leader of the opposition party Jitendra Sonal said that even though it is also his party’s stance that the police administration should come under the purview of the province, the sit-in in Janakpur will not be enough to create pressure on the federal government. “There is no point in staging a sit-in in Janakpur. The protest must be organised in Kathmandu,” said Sonal. “The protest organised here has no relevance.”Earlier on July 7, internal affairs ministers of all the seven provinces had issued a seven-point declaration including their demand for an early adjustment of the police force.In the second week of July, the internal affairs ministers met all major leaders of the ruling coalition and set a mid-August deadline to adjust the police force.The federal government, however, is unlikely to adjust the police force as general and provincial elections have already been declared for November 20.The federal government has already taken control of security arrangements of the three districts of Kathmandu Valley—Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur—by amending the existing laws despite the controversy, as even ruling party lawmakers said the move would breach the constitution.The constitution says that the responsibility for the security of the province falls under the provinces. Kathmandu Valley falls under the Bagmati Province.Conflict is set to escalate as the provincial governments want police adjustment before the November 20 polls while the federal government wishes to delay it until the polls.","Published at : August 14, 2022",Dhanusa,Santosh Singh
"Man attempts to burn wife, mother-in-law to death","A man in Mahottari district attempted to burn his wife and mother-in-law to death by dousing them in kerosene at Bhangaha Municipality-1 of Mahottari district, police said. The victims sustained critical burn injuries in the incident.According to the District Police Office in Mahottari, the alleged perpetrator Shankar Sada of Aurahi Municipality-8 in the district poured kerosene on his wife aged 35 and mother-in-law aged 65, on Saturday night. Deputy Superintendent of Police Prakash Bista said Shankar attempted to kill them after a heated family dispute.The critically injured mother and daughter were rushed to Provincial Hospital in Janakpur for treatment. The mother sustained serious burn injuries on her back, arms and left leg while her daughter sustained injuries on her chest, arms and legs.The provincial hospital referred the victims to Kathmandu as their treatment was not possible in Janakpur. “The victims are in critical condition. We referred both of them to the national capital as their treatment is not possible in Janakpur,” said Dr Rupesh Barma, who was involved in their treatment at the provincial hospital. According to Barma, the mother is expected to recover following treatment but the daughter's health condition is very critical.Shankar fled the scene soon after the incident. Search is underway to nab the perpetrator, said police.The perpetrator attacked the women while they were asleep at around midnight. The suspect set them on fire after dousing them with kerosene. He locked the door from outside and ran away soon after the crime.The women cried for help but the villagers did not hear them as it was raining heavily. Rajawati Devi, a neighbour, knew about the incident first and informed other neighbours. ""They were immediately rushed to Janakpur after the villagers knew about the incident,"" said Sana Kumari Sada, a relative of the victims who stays in another house in the settlement. According to her, there were no serious disputes in the family.Police recovered an alcohol bottle that the perpetrator used to bring kerosene from a nearby shop.According to the locals, Shankar and his wife went to the field nearby together on Saturday evening to collect fodder for the cattle. He brought the kerosene while returning from the field.Shankar was staying at his in-law’s house with his wife and mother-in-law after returning from foreign employment in Kuwait a year ago.","Published at : August 8, 2022",Dhanusha,Santosh Singh
Midday meal scheme in corruption controversy in Madhes districts,"Several community schools in at least two districts of Madhesh Province have not been able to resume the midday meal programme effectively post Covid-induced school closure.The scheme has been mired in controversy and charges of corruption and irregularities in its implementation. The government introduced the scheme with aims to ensure hunger does not keep students away from school.Mukesh Jha, the father of two children who attend Kabilasi Secondary School in Kalibasi Municipality Ward No 7 in Sarlahi, says his children were not given meals at school since the school reopened for the new academic year in May.He alleges that the principal of the school and employees of the municipality in collusion have misused the midday meal programme funds leading to irregular meals for the students. “The people’s representatives also know of this but remain silent,” he said.Parents of students attending community schools in Ishwarpur Municipality, home to 38 community schools, also accuse the local unit and the executives of the schools of misusing the funds.Dinesh Luitel, chief of the municipality’s education unit, said the midday meal scheme was halted in the schools for 15 days before the end of the last fiscal year on July 16. “We will resume the programme in mid-August after the summer holidays,” he said.Meanwhile, community schools in the northern part of Sarlahi have successfully restarted the scheme after a gap of almost two years.Balgovind Secondary School in Kabilasi Municipality Ward No.1 and Haripur Primary School in Haripur Municipality Ward No 8 have resumed the programme.The federal government provides Rs 15 per day to each student studying up to grade five in the province’s community schools through the local units. With this scheme, the government aims to provide nutritious diet to the children and control malnutrition in the province.The community school midday meal programme is being run in 42 out of 77 districts in the country. While the government manages the programme in 33 districts, the World Food Programme funds midday meals for the children of select schools in nine districts.Under the programme, the community schools should prepare nutritious foods for the children as per separate menus prepared by the Centre for Education and Human Resource Development, which mentions 60 different foods in its menu.In Rautahat, schools and local units were found to have withdrawn money for the midday meal programme which has remained suspended throughout the school closure period. According to the Auditor General's report for 2021, in the fiscal year 2019-20, Paroha Municipality spent more than Rs11 million on the midday meal programme; Fatuwa Bijaypur Municipality spent Rs9 million, Garuda Municipality Rs7 million, Durga Bhagwati Rural Municipality Rs 12 million; and Yamunamai Rural Municipality Rs7 million.Paroha Municipality, home to 21 community schools, reportedly distributed cash directly to the parents of the students rather than providing meals at the school. The Auditor General’s report states that the municipality disbursed Rs11.7 million for the programme in the fiscal year 2020-21.The midday meal programme was embroiled in controversy in Garuda Municipality with the then mayor of the municipality Innuray Yadav and deputy mayor Rangila Devi Jaiswal alleging each other of misuse of the programme funds.There are 23 community schools in this municipality, including seven secondary schools. According to Kanthamuni Jaiswal, the municipality’s incumbent mayor, the children of the school in the area were deprived of midday lunch for seven months. The programme was discontinued in mid-April last year and resumed in December. Nearly Rs 26 million budget allocated for the midday meal programme was frozen.The 58th annual report of the Office of Auditor General states more than Rs 48.7 million from the midday lunch programme has been withdrawn by the Paroha, Fatuwa Bijaypur, Garuda, and Yamuna municipalities of Rautahat district against the rules by forging paperwork.Bunilal Yadav, the then education coordinator of the Education Unit of Fatuwa Bijaypur Municipality, was also heavily criticised for withdrawing the lunch programme money when the schools were closed during the pandemic.","Published at : July 22, 2022",Sarlahi/rautahat,Om Prakash Thakur						 &
Monsoon means disaster in Madhes Province,"Every year during the monsoon, floods and inundations wreak havoc in Madhesh Province which comprises eight Tarai districts. Thousands of people face displacement, loss of lives and property due to the lack of preparedness by the authorities to control such water-induced disasters.In Saptari, a Musahar settlement in Hanumannagar Kankalini Municipality-4 is at high risk of floods as the Mahuli stream has started eroding the embankment. The 10 impoverished Dalit families of the settlement, who are living on encroached land, are living in fear of displacement as the government authorities and people’s representatives have not taken any initiatives to protect the settlement from the floods.“The settlement is being eroded by the Mahuli stream in the west and a small water outlet from the east. One house was swept away recently while others are at high risk. We are encircled by floods but nobody is concerned about our plight,” said Manju Devi Sada, a resident of the Musahar settlement.On Monday night, the area received heavy rainfall and the water level in the Mahuli stream increased, trapping the villagers inside the settlement. “The erosion is increasing day by day. The settlement will turn into a sandy bank within a few days if the stream and rivulet are not controlled immediately. We have nowhere to go if the floods displace us,” said Manju Devi. She urged the concerned authorities and the local unit to protect their settlement from flooding and erosion.According to Mauli Mandal, the ward chairman of Hanumannagar Kankalini-4, the flood waters flowing from the northern side last year eroded the area near the Musahar settlement and emptied into the Mahuli stream. He admitted that the settlement is at high risk of floods this year too.“The flood already swept away a house while others are at risk. Efforts are underway to control the floods and protect the settlement by installing hume pipes,” said Birendra Majhi, the mayor of Hanumannagar Kankalini. In mid-July last year, Chandiya village in Rajdevi Municipality-3 of Rautahat was inundated following continuous rainfall. Every single house in the village was submerged. The villagers left their houses and ran. Some people were injured when their houses collapsed.Jayram Shah recalls his house collapsing while his whole family was inside. “We nearly died. All of us suffered injuries,” said Shah. Every monsoon, Chandiya residents struggle to keep afloat and save themselves and their properties from floods in the Bagmati River. The floodwaters from the river enter the village every year resulting in floods and inundation. “Nobody can understand our situation except us. We suffer every year. The government does nothing to address our problem,” said Shah.There are about 200 households in Chandiya village and all of them have been displaced by monsoon disasters. A 44 km-long dam has been constructed with the help of the Government of India to prevent loss of property due to floods in the Bagmati River. All the displaced folks from Chandiya have to take shelter in the dam area every year. The villages bordering Chandiya, including the district headquarters Gaur, are living the same fate. The floodwaters from the Lalbakaiya and Bagmati rivers inundate the settlement during the monsoon and inundate 80 percent of the land every year. Three days ago, the district administration instructed the local units in the district to start preparing for water-induced disasters this monsoon. “We spend our days and nights worrying about how to save our lives and the lives of our family during the rainy season. We have been suffering for the past 29 years and it seems like the government does not want to listen to us,” said Pramod Das of Durga Bhagwati Rural Municipality-5.There are about 300 houses built in and around the dam area in the Bagmati River and all of them are at high risk of being submerged this rainy season. According to Chief District Officer Krishna Bahadur Shahi, the main problem of Rautahat has always been floods and inundation. The office has instructed all its local units to be prepared for water-induced disasters. According to the data of the District Police Office in Rautahat, 90 people have been killed in floods and inundation in different parts of the district in the last three years. Six people, including two women, have gone missing, about 70,000 households have been affected, 20,000 families displaced and over 400 cattle killed in the floods.","Published at : June 25, 2022",Rautahat & Saptari,Shiva Puri						 &
Malnutrition taking its toll in Parsa. Experts blame poverty and ignorance,"Seven-year-old Dil Kumari Pahari, a resident of Chandrapur Municipality-8 in Rautahat district, was taken to the Nutrition Rehabilitation Home at the Birgunj-based Narayani Hospital on June 14 in a critical condition. Dil Kumari, who belongs to the impoverished Pahari community, was diagnosed with severe malnutrition.“The child was found suffering from severe malnutrition due to a lack of nutritious food. Her body was swollen when she was brought to the Nutrition Rehabilitation Home. And there were problems in all her vital organs, except the kidney,” said Sarita Yadav, the chief at the Nutrition Rehabilitation Home. The girl, according to Yadav, weighed 22.7 kg when she was brought there. Dil Kumari was brought to Judibela Health Post by a local teacher who had gone to Phulbari settlement in Chandrapur as part of a school enrollment programme. The health post later referred the girl to the Nutrition Rehabilitation Home in Birgunj.The girl is receiving treatment at the paediatric unit of Narayani Hospital.“She is also suffering from anaemia. We gave her a blood transfusion. Her condition is gradually improving. We will keep her at the Nutrition Rehabilitation Home until she gets better and make provisions for nutritious food after she is discharged from the hospital,” said Yadav. According to her, victims of severe malnutrition like Dil Kumari may die if they do not get timely treatment.Dil Kumari’s father Aadu Bahadur, aged 65, has been languishing in the hospital as an attendant to his ailing daughter. He said his wife died three months ago due to stomach cancer.“I have three children, including Dil Kumari. We have just about 1,500 sq ft of land. What I grow in the fields is not enough to feed the family. I am old and jobless. So I am unable to provide nutritious foods to my children,” said Aadu Bahadur. According to him, he somehow manages to bring home rice that they consume with salt but he never feeds milk to his children. “Except for breast milk, my children have never tasted milk in their life,” he added.Malnutrition is a serious health challenge in Madhes Province mainly due to poverty and a lack of awareness among guardians regarding nourishing food needed for a child’s growth. The children of poor communities and Dalits are especially vulnerable to malnutrition in the province.“The main cause of malnutrition is a lack of awareness among the guardians. They are unaware of the importance of nourishing food required for the overall growth of the children. They do not take their wards to health institutions unless they fall ill seriously due to malnutrition,” said Yadav. According to her, most families in the province eat potatoes for vegetables which are low in nutrients. “People generally offer packaged foods like noodles and biscuits to their kids. Even the guardians who have the ability to provide nutritious foods to their children are found to be reluctant to provide nutritional foods like milk, yoghurt, egg and meat,” she said.According to Yadav, the nutrition home identifies malnourished children on the basis of the latest standard set by the World Health Organisation. As per the standard, the height of a newborn should generally be 50cm and it should increase by 25cm, 12.5cm and 12.5cm in the next three years, respectively.The Nutrition Rehabilitation Home in Narayani Hospital was established in 2006. Thirteen malnourished children from various districts of Madhes are currently undergoing treatment at the 10-bed nutritional home. As many as 170 children—88 male and 82 female—were brought to the Birgunj-based Nutrition Rehabilitation Home in the current fiscal year of 2021-22. Among them, nine are below the age of six months, 96 are between 6-24 months, 45 are between 25-60 months and 20 are above 60 months.","Published at : June 22, 2022",Parsa,Shankar Acharya
Youths taking up nature guide training,"Elisha Mulmi, a resident of Jitpur Simara Sub-metropolis-5 in Bara district, is a first year bachelor’s student at the Hetauda-based Institute of Forestry. The 19-year-old recently received a weeklong nature guide training conducted by the Parsa National Park. She took the training to gain practical knowledge about forests and nature, she said.“The training was an opportunity to get on-field information regarding natural vegetation and wildlife which is essential for an aspiring nature guide,” said Mulmi. Debi Magar had some free time after graduating from grade 12 so she too decided to join the training. The nature guide training has been a boon for the 19-year-old girl to utilise her leisure time and get the opportunity of learning new things. “I was free after passing grade 12. I received the nature guide training to learn new things about forest, wildlife and nature,” said Magar.Pujan Shrestha, aged 21, of Subarnapur in Thori Municipality-5 is another recipient of the nature guide training. He has always been very interested in the study of forests and wildlife since his early childhood. “I have a deep interest in working in the field of forest and wildlife. My father is a conservationist. The nature guide training has been a great opportunity for me. I plan to run a home-stay or a resort and work in the tourism sector,” said Shrestha, stating that the weeklong training fulfilled his ardent wish to watch nature and wildlife closely.Many youths like Mulmi, Magar and Shrestha are taking up nature guide training in Parsa. As many as 20 youths, including three women, received the training that was provided by the Parsa National Park last month. According to Tikaram Giri, one of the two trainers involved in the nature guide training, all the participants were below 35 years of age.“The trainees were very enthusiastic and participatory. We took the participants to the forests two times a day and provided field training. They closely watched wildlife and birds and learned to identify the footprints of various wild animals,” said Giri. According to him, the trainees were taught about their duties and responsibilities before they took up their jobs as nature guides.The Madhes Province government declared the Thori area of Parsa district as a tourist area a few months ago. Such training is expected to benefit the local youths. “The local people, mainly the youth, can run homestays or start a hotel business after receiving such training. Tourism entrepreneurship should not be confined only to Chitwan, particularly in Sauraha. The youths should be involved in tourism where there are prospects,” said Giri, claiming that the nature guide training was quite helpful in encouraging the youths interested in nature tourism. Parsa National Park, the country’s youngest national park, had provided similar training six years ago but almost all of the training recipients then did not involve themselves in tourism activities. According to chief conservation officer at the park Manoj Kumar Sah, the participants of the nature guide training were selected by the consumers’ committee of the park this time hoping that they will be involved in tourism-related activities. “The national park aims to promote tourism in the area by providing such training to aspiring tourism entrepreneurs and tourist guides. We plan to provide similar training next year too with the objective of enhancing the number of trained nature guides,” said Sah.","Published at : May 21, 2022",Parsa,Shankar Acharya
Mismanagement plagues Janaki Eye Hospital,"Last Friday, Manmohan Sah of Janakpur Sub-metropolitan City-8 visited the Janaki Eye Hospital, where he was examined by a technician instead of a specialist doctor.“There are two types of tickets in the hospital. If you pay Rs 50, you’ll have to wait in line for your turn to see the doctor. If you pay Rs 250, they fast-track the process and take you to a doctor immediately,” said 49-year-old Sah. “I got a ticket costing Rs 250 but when I was taken to the doctor’s cabin, a technician walked in and told me that the doctor was away so he would examine me. I was quite taken aback.”The hospital, which has been treating an average of 600 patients daily, is falling apart at the seams with everyday management of health services left unattended.The hospital has been operating without a chief administrator for four years, according to the hospital’s information department.The health institution has total designated posts for five specialist doctors but currently, only two positions are filled. Dr Ashish Bohara, who is also the executive director of the hospital, and Dr Amit Yadav are the only two specialist doctors at the hospital and in the absence of both, patients are left in the care of technicians.On Friday, a long queue had formed outside the ticket booth but both the doctors were absent. According to hospital sources, Bohara along with acting administrator Jitendra Singh had gone to attend a medical conference in Pokhara while the patients spent the entire day waiting for the doctors.Information Officer Rudal Prasad Sah was also on leave and Accountant Rajan Sah had gone to the bank when the Post reached the hospital on Friday.According to hospital data, a total of 125,000 patients have been receiving OPD services at the hospital annually. About 10,000 to 11,000 of them undergo cataract surgery, about 9,000 patients undergo Small Incision Cataract Surgery and about 2,000 patients go for Phacoemulsification procedure.The hospital is run by the Nepal Red Cross Society. A provision allows the central committee members of the Red Cross Society to appoint the chairman of the board of directors and the treasurer. In January 2021, UML leader Gangaram Yadav was appointed chairman and Sanjay Kumar Sah the treasurer.“Not a single meeting has been held in the last 16 months since the formation of the board of directors,” Sah, the treasurer, said. “The hospital is in a pitiable state.”","Published at : May 1, 2022",Janakpur,Shyam Sundar Shashi
Voters in Birgunj are perplexed as to who to vote for because of alliance politics,"Seventy-year-old Shuvan Dewan of Nagwa Gaon in Birgunj Metropolitan City has been exercising franchise for 52 years. By his age and the experience of participating in elections over the years, he always considered himself a conscious voter. He has been voting for Madhes-based parties every election since 2008, he says. But he is confused now.“The so-called big parties always undermined the Madhesis. And the parties that have their roots in Madhes have gone to join hands with them,” he said. “They promise one Madhes province of 22 districts, but they settle for eight. They promised Rs5 million for the kin of the martyrs of [political] movements but nothing happened. Now I wonder who to vote for and on what basis.”Dewan’s disenchantment stems from the Madhes-based parties’ decision to align with those forces against which they were once fighting. Also, Madhes-based parties’ failure to stick together to fight for the Madhes cause has left him disappointed.Currently, there are two recognised forces in Madhes Province—Janata Samajbadi Party and Loktantrik Samajbadi Party. Until August, they were one force, ultimately united having suffered several splits. The Janata Samajbadi is under an alliance with the Nepali Congress, the CPN (Maoist Centre) and the CPN (Unified Socialist). The other force in the coalition, Rastriya Janamorcha, has negligible clout in Madhes.The Loktantrik Samajbadi, on the other hand, has forged an alliance with the CPN-UML, whose leader KP Sharma Oli is largely viewed as an anti-Madhes politician. Manoj Sah, who is a devoted worker of the Nepali Congress, is upset with the party leadership for not fielding a mayoral candidate for Birgunj Metropolitan City. Sah said his morals do not allow him to vote for a candidate who is not from his party.As per an understanding among the coalition leaders, Janata Samajbadi’s Rajesh Man Singh and Imtiyaz Alam of the Congress are running for mayor and deputy mayor posts in Birgunj.Vijay Sarawagi, who won the mayoral race in 2017 from the then Sanghiya Samajbadi Forum (now Janata Samajbadi Party), has switched to the UML, seeking a second term in office. Loktantrik Samajbadi’s Purushottam Jha is the deputy mayor candidate as per the party’s electoral understanding with the UML. Sah says ideological lines in Nepali politics have been blurred, making it difficult for many loyal voters to decide who to vote for because of alliance politics.Madhes is the second largest province in terms of the number of voters, with a total of 3,331,170 registered voters, according to the Election Commission.  Deepak KC/TKPBirgunj is a major business and industrial hub of Madhes. Bordering India, it is a politically significant city, a hotspot of the Madhes Movement. Birgunj is a microcosm of Madhes.Birendra Sah, a lecturer of sociology at the Birgunj-based Thakur Ram Multiple Campus, said this is the first election since 2008 when the Madhes Movement is not in focus.The 2007 Madhes Movement, spearheaded by the leaders of the two Madhes-based parties, largely contributed to the country’s adoption of a federal system.“The movement made the people politically aware but the leaders used it as a tool to fulfil their petty interests,” said Sah. “Several issues remain unaddressed. Madhes-based parties, however, failed to remain united.”According to Sah, there is no ideological base in any of the Madhes-based parties now and no party has any long-term plans.“Party leaders are forming alliances with those forces which were their foes once,” Sah added. “Which party should the people choose? Whose agenda is correct? The voters in Madhes are confused.”The Madhes-based parties in 2017 had even decided to boycott local elections because they had their objection to the constitution, which they and some other sections of the society said further marginalised the downtrodden. It was because of their protests that the 2017 local elections were held in three phases.When Madhes-based parties were leading protests in the lead up to the constitution promulgation, they received an overwhelming support from the people of the entire region.But over the years, observers say, Madhes-based parties joined hands with forces like the Congress, the Maoist Centre and the UML, who they once charged with writing an anti-Madhes constitution.Sah, the lecturer, says parties have failed to make the voters understand why these local elections are being held.“The parties have imposed candidates on the voters, giving them little room to make a choice,” Sah told the Post. “Those who have money and influence stand a better chance of winning even if they don’t have any agenda. How can democracy strengthen when voters are forced into elections in such a way?”There are a total of 136 local units in the eight districts of Madhes Province, where Birgunj is the only metropolitan city. There are three sub-metropolitan cities, 73 (urban) municipalities and 59 rural municipalities.Madhes-based parties held sway in the province during the 2017 elections, while the Congress had traditionally enjoyed clout in the region, with the UML not having much influence. The Madhesi parties this time are not only divided but have aligned with different forces.In the 2017 local polls, the Janata Samajbadi and Loktantrik Samajbadi had won 26 and 25 local units in the province. The Congress had won 40 local units, the Maoist Centre 21 and the UML 18. The remaining six units were won by some fringe forces.Chandra Kishore, a journalist and writer based in Birgunj, says the Madhesi people, Madhesi agenda and Madhesi parties should be understood differently.“Even though the parties are divided, the agenda of the movement raised by the Madhesi people is still relevant,” Chandra Kishore told the Post. “The election result of 2017 was influenced by the current of the Madhes movement. Since the state was refusing to talk to dissenting forces, they wanted to take the movement forward through elections. But that’s not the case anymore. Hence, alliances were formed.”Due to alliance politics, parties have been forced to support candidates from other parties.“The coalition’s electoral alliance suddenly became strong largely because of the country’s internal politics, geopolitics and the alliance partners’ goal to increase the number of seats in the House of Representatives,” said Chandra Kishore.The UML and the Maoist Centre had swept the 2017 national elections as they had fought under an alliance. The parties merged in May 2018, but the merger was invalidated in March last year. Then in August last year, the Madhav Nepal faction split from the UML to form the CPN (Unified Socialist).The UML, however, continues to remain the largest party in the House of Representatives. The Congress, the Maoist Centre and the Unified Socialist now want to defeat the UML, hence they have decided to stick together and have roped in the Janata Samajbadi and Rastriya Janamorcha in the alliance too.Chandra Kishore believes alliance politics has made three kinds of impacts on Madhes politics.“It has put the brakes on the continuity of Congress-Madhes relations. Despite Birgunj and Janakpur being its strongholds, the party has decided to cede mayoral posts to the Janata Samajbadi,” he said. “While the UML seems to have significantly increased its base in Madhes, Madhes-based parties that emerged as encouraging forces riding on the Madhes movement are disintegrating.”","Published at : May 1, 2022",Birgunj,Tufan Neupane						 &
Chandrapur adopts door-to-door campaign to make Dalit children attend school,"In a bid to include Dalit children in the school system, Chandrapur Municipality in Rautahat is conducting a door-to-door campaign wherein teachers from various community schools visit Dalit households to encourage the guardians to send their wards to school.The school enrollment programme is a nationwide campaign launched by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology with an objective to provide school education to all children of school-going age. The campaign generally starts in the last week of April every year by organising awareness programmes to bring all the children under the school system. But due to the Secondary Education Examination and local elections, the campaign was pushed back to mid-May in several districts this year.The District Education Office, Rautahat, has plans afoot for the campaign to send teachers to Dalit households in two weeks to encourage parents to send their wards to school.Rajesh Chaudhary, principal of Dumriya Secondary School, in Ward No 9 of Chandrapur Municipality, says it is necessary for the programme to see successful results in the Dalit community since the number of Dalit children in schools is not encouraging.Although the school enrollment campaign started off as a noble undertaking by the government to bring every child into the school system, the campaign has not seen much success in the Dalit communities, says Anup Majhi, a central member of the Nepal National Musahar Association.“The number of children of school-going age is more than 5,000 in Rautahat but not even a quarter of them go to school,” said Majhi. “There are 2,056 households in the Musahar community in the district but hardly anyone is literate.”The low enrollment number of Dalit children in schools can be attributed to parents’ inability to afford education for their children, clubbed with a lack of interest from school management, says Majhi.The population of Musahars in the district is 13,796 and only 635 people out of the entire population are literate, according to Majhi. Of which, as many as 3,000 are still out of the school system.“Specific plans and policies should be put in place to ensure every Dalit child attends school because it’s not enough to just look at the number of students enrolled,” Majhi added. “This is the only way to ensure the next generation of the Dalit population is not deprived of opportunities for a lack of education.”Dumriya Secondary School plans to extend financial support to Dalit families who have not been able to send their children to school because of financial constraints. “We want to ensure that children are not forced to leave school to support their families,” said Chaudhary, the principal.The Education Unit of Chandrapur Municipality says that every possible step would be taken to reach Dalit settlements with the campaign.According to Dipendra Mandal, education branch officer at the municipality, even though there are schools nearby Dalit settlements of Dom, Musahar and Chamar communities, children from these communities do not attend classes regularly even if they are enrolled. “When parents don’t force them to go to school, they don’t make the effort to attend classes and instead spend their days idling around,” said Mandal. “Apart from enrolling Dalit students in schools, we have to create a conducive environment at home and school.”Ram Binay Singh, head of the Education Development and Coordination Unit in Gaur, said that there are around 400 basic schools in the district’s 18 local units.Dalit children from all local units including Gujra, Gaur, Garuda, Brindaban, Ishnath and Katahariya municipalities go to school but in small numbers.Although the government has promised to provide assistance to the extremely poor, Dalit students have not been able to access the concessions provided under the education campaign, according to Mandal.In most Dalit households with poor financial standing, education features last on the priority list. The foremost concern for the entire household is making ends meet on a daily basis. Rajkumar Majhi from Jugauli, Gujra Municipality-8, for instance, has two sons and two daughters, all of whom are of school-going age but he says he doesn’t have the money to send them to school. “Whatever little money I make, I spend it on fulfilling my family’s basic needs,” he told the Post. “I would send my children to school but first, I have to keep them from starving.”According to Binod Jaiswal, the acting chief administrative officer of Gujra Municipality, none of the children in Musahar settlement of Jugauli in Ward No 8 goes to school. There are 70 Musahar households in the settlement and around 100 children of school-going age, according to Jaiswal. “This time the office will make more effort to have all of those children enrolled in schools,” he said.","Published at : April 30, 2022",Rautahat,Shiva Puri
Timber smuggling resumes in Sarlahi,"The felling and smuggling of sal trees goes rampant in several forests of Sarlahi, a Tarai district of Madhes Province.Janakinagar collaborative forest in Hariharpur Municipality-1 has become a safe haven for timber smuggling in the past few years. According to the local people, timber smuggling goes unchecked due to the lack of effective patrolling in the forest area. “It is apparent that some local people are also involved in the smuggling of timber in collusion with the office bearers of the forest committee and the employees of the division forest office,” said a local resident of Hariharpur-1, who asked to stay anonymous.The smugglers had cut down dozens of sal trees and smuggled the timber in the months of October and November last year. The felling and smuggling of timber came to a halt for a few months following the coverage of the issue by various news media outlets, including The Kathmandu Post. “However, the felling and smuggling of trees has resumed in Janakinagar collaborative forest. The concerned authorities seem indifferent to controlling the timber smuggling,” said the local.Janakinagar collaborative forest spreads across 1,200 hectares of land. The smugglers cut down green sal trees, log them and smuggle them using bicycles and tractors. More than 100 sal trees have been cut down in the forest in the past few months.“Patrolling should be intensified in the forest area to control timber smuggling,” said another local of Ghurkauli, who also wished his name to be withheld. “But the division forest office and forest consumers’ committee are indifferent to strengthening security in the area. The security team patrol the forest occasionally and that too when the local people pressurise them.” The office-bearers of Janakinagar collaborative forest admit that there has been an increase in timber smuggling in the forest of late.They, however, claim that smuggling cannot be controlled by the forest office alone.Ram Bishwas Raya, the chairman of Janakinagar collaborative forest, said that the forest office, forest committee and the local people should work hand in hand to control deforestation and timber smuggling. According to him, the forest has just three armed forest guards and they are not enough to patrol the forest regularly.“We requested the division forest office and federal forest ministry several times to mobilise more armed forest guards for patrolling but our requests remain unaddressed. The forest committee alone cannot control the illegal felling and smuggling of trees,” said Raya. According to the sub-division forest office in Janakinagar, there are just eight employees at the office. “Three employees have been mobilised in the Chure forest area while five are deployed in the forests situated south from the East-West Highway. With such limited resources, forest patrolling is not effective,” said Subas Sah, chief at the sub-division office. The division forest office claims that the people of various settlements near the forest are involved in timber smuggling. “The forest office recovered timber of illegally felled trees while raiding the area at different times,” said Santosh Jha, chief at the division forest office. The security personnel seized smuggled timber of sal trees felled in Janakinagar collaborative forest. Similarly, an Armed Police Force (APF) team seized 57.4 cubic feet of timber hidden in the forest area on Thursday. According to the APF base camp in Hariwan, the seized timber worth around Rs 300,000 was handed over to the division forest office for investigation. Similarly, the APF seized a tractor loaded with 36.76 cubic feet of smuggled timber on Saturday.According to Jha, the forest office has recently asked for a clarification from the forest consumers’ committee of Janakinagar collaborative forest regarding the felling of trees and timber smuggling.","Published at : April 6, 2022",Sarlahi,Om Prakash Thakur
Captive elephants being smuggled to India through Parsa,"Acting on a tip-off, a team of security personnel from the Area Police Office in Pokhariya detained three people with two captive elephants from Pakahamainpur Rural Municipality-5 in Parsa district on Saturday.Animal rights activists and investigation officers claim that the elephants were being smuggled to India from Sauraha, a tourist destination near Chitwan National Park.According to the District Police Office in Parsa, Apharoj Alam, 35, of Pakahamainapur-5 and Budiram Mahato, 60, and Raju Kumal, 40, of Bharatpur Metropolis-18 in Chitwan district were arrested on the charge of smuggling the captive elephants. The preliminary police investigation shows that Alam is the smuggler while Mahato and Kumal are the mahouts.“Our investigation has revealed that Alam brought both the elephants from Chitwan. He kept the jumbos in Parsa for the past one year waiting for a suitable time to cross the border. We caught them before they could cross into India,” said Deputy Superintendent of Police Om Prakash Khanal. According to him, the trio were arrested as domesticating elephants without permission and trading them is illegal in Nepal. An elephant is traded at around Rs 1 to 3 million in India, he added.Police handed over the suspects and the two elephants to Parsa National Park on Saturday. According to Santosh Bhagat, the information officer at Parsa National Park, the Division Forest Office in Parsa has been given the responsibility to investigate the case.“The elephants were taken under control outside the buffer zone of the national park. So we have given the responsibility of investigating the case to the Division Forest Office in Parsa,” said Bhagat.Trading of elephants has been banned by the CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) and the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act, 1973. The CITES, which is a global agreement among governments to regulate or ban international trade of species under threat, has enlisted Asian elephants in Appendix I.Tourism entrepreneurs in Sauraha raise captive elephants to use them for safaris and earn money. As the tourism industry was hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic, these elephant owners were at their wit’s end since their income had come down to zero but their expenses remained the same. “The captive elephants, mainly the old and diseased, are taken to India and sold. We informed the police when we got to know that Alam and his men were taking the elephants to India for sale,” said Shristi Singh Shrestha, an animal rights activist. “We were informed that Alam was planning to smuggle two other elephants as well. We are working to check the possible smuggling of the other elephants.” Shrestha, who has been working for animal rights for the past decade, said that captive elephants from Chitwan are being smuggled to various places of India through Parsa. “Elephants are still being used in various temples and religious functions, including weddings, in India. We work in coordination with animal rights activists in India to keep a check on elephant smuggling,” said Shrestha.According to Shrestha, there are around 100 private captive elephants in Sauraha. She said some elephant owners started selling their elephants as tourism came to a standstill in 2020 because of the pandemic. The government authorities started registering private elephants in Sauraha a few months ago. However, Shrestha claims that around a dozen captive elephants are unaccounted for.“Those unaccounted elephants might have been smuggled to India or kept hidden to be smuggled later,” said Shrestha.","Published at : March 29, 2022",Parsa,Shankar Acharya
Musahar children in Rautahat deprived of formal education and state benefits,"Kabita Majhi, a 24-year-old woman of Dumariya, a Musahar settlement in Chandrapur Municipality-9, has four daughters. All four of her daughters are deprived of education and government facilities since their births have not been registered at the ward office.Majhi does not have a citizenship certificate therefore she couldn’t register the births of her children, she says.According to the existing legal provisions, the guardians have to furnish their children’s birth certificates while seeking admission at a school.Without a birth certificate, Majhi’s children are deprived not only of formal education but also of all child welfare schemes allowed by the government. “My daughters, who are between the ages of four and nine, haven’t been able to go to school because they don’t have a birth certificate,” said Majhi. “I can’t even collect the nutrition allowance from the local level for my youngest one as her birth is not registered.” The government in 2017 had announced a nutrition allowance programme for children under the age of five in Rautahat, Bajhang and Achham districts. Before that, only Dalit children were provided with the monthly nutrition allowance of Rs 400. But in Rautahat, a majority of children from the impoverished Musahar community do not have access to such government programmes.“I don’t have a citizenship card and both of my parents are dead. In a situation like this, the ward office should help people like us,” said Majhi. “I have tried every possible way to get birth certificates for my children but failed to do so.” Majhi tried to enroll her daughters of school-going age to Dumariya Secondary School near the Musahar settlement but the school denied them admission in the absence of birth certificates. Manoj Musahar, another local, said there are around 50 children in Dumariya without birth certificates. “There are more Musahar children in other local units of the district who don’t have birth certificates,” said Manoj.According to Keshab Basnet, ward secretary of Chandrapur, the citizenship and marriage certificates of the parents are needed to apply for a birth certificate at the local level.“Guardians can register the birth of a child within 35 days of birth for free. After 35 days, they can still register the birth but will be charged Rs 200. The municipality has also been providing a nutrition allowance of Rs 500 per month for children under the age of five,” he said. “To register a child’s birth, parents must furnish their citizenship, but if they don’t have the document, they must come to the ward office.” “In most cases, parents come to the ward office and leave when they find out that they need their citizenship certificate to register the birth of their child,” Govinda Dulal, chairman of ward-9, told the Post. “If they have issues, they can talk to us. I will now take the initiative of providing birth certificates to Musahar children.” The government’s programme provides nutrition allowance to up to two children born to a couple. It is estimated that around 500 children of Musahar and Dom communities in Rautahat have not been able to get the allowance. Anup Majhi, a resident of Gajura Municipality-5, said that Musahar children are deprived of their birth and citizenship certificates due to the apathy of the local level government. “Authorities in the ward office have to look into these issues on a case-by-case basis. Many Musahar families do not have citizenship certificates and we have been deprived of government services and opportunities our entire lives because of that,” said Anup. “Our children should not go through the same miseries. They are already deprived of state facilities and education. They will be left behind if this disparity continues.”According to a recent report released by Madhes’s Policy Commission, Rautahat is multi-dimensionally the poorest and least literate district in Madhes Province. The province has an economic poverty index of 27.7 percent.","Published at : March 24, 2022",Rautahat,Shiva Puri
People of some Bardibas villages deprived of health care services,"The residents of several villages in Bardibas Municipality, Mahottari have to walk for four hours to reach the nearest health post. Some villages like Chhodke, Jhyauray and Bhyangre do not even have motorable roads, and this has deprived the villagers of timely medical attention.Poor infrastructure and a lack of roads in the villages have especially put pregnant women at high risk.The closest health post with maternity services is in Khayarmara, a four-hour walk from these villages. Since the health post is too far to visit for regular checkups, the villagers take pregnant women there for medical examination only in case of complications. “Pregnant women from these villages rarely come for prenatal checkups. They are only brought to the health post when they face complications,” said Kamala Giri, a health worker at Khayarmara Health Post.Recently, 18-year-old Sumitra Magar was brought to the health post after her health deteriorated while giving birth. She had been unable to give birth even after two days of prolonged labour. The villagers had to carry Magar all the way to the health post and back. She had a safe delivery the next day at the health post. “If she had been brought to the health post on time, she would not have had to suffer for so long,” said Giri.The lack of motorable roads has not only deprived the villagers of health services but it has also cut them off from education, drinking water and transportation services.“The villagers have always lived in depravity,” said Deo Maya Magar, a local resident. “Before federalism, we did not even have access to institutional births. The local government established a birthing centre at the health post only a couple of years ago so that the women could have a chance at surviving difficult births.” “Earlier, we had to go to Bardibas to give institutional births. It took us more than six hours to reach Bardibas on foot. At least now we have a birthing centre at Khayarmara,” she added.According to her, health workers at the Khayarmara health post also pay home visits in case of emergencies. “Pregnant women in Chhodke and Bhyangre villages do not come for health checkups so we go to the villages to monitor their health conditions,” said Mamata Rai, a staff nurse at the health post. “It’s difficult for pregnant women to make the journey to the health post so they don’t visit us unless it’s an emergency.”Dhanraj Lama, ward chairman of Bardibas Municipality-11, says the local unit is working towards improving the health services at Khayarmara health post. “We have constructed a new building for the health post at a cost of Rs 45,54,000 from the local unit’s budget. It will soon come into operation,” said Lama. “We also have some development plans to cater to the residents of remote villages,” said Mayor Bidur Karki. “However, opening road tracks to the villages is a huge task because of the geographical remoteness of these villages. We are exploring all possible alternatives.”","Published at : March 4, 2022",Mahottari,Sunita Baral
Commercial farming empowers women from a Musahar community in Siraha,"Anita Devi Sada, a squatter from a Musahar settlement at Kalyanpur Municipality-9, Siraha, used to work as a daily wage worker until last year. The meagre income she earned was barely enough to feed her family of five. But things have changed now. Anita, who is in her early forties, started her own commercial vegetable farming last year. She now makes good money producing and selling vegetables in the local markets. “Initially, I grew ladies’ fingers and sold them in the local market. Now I grow different types of vegetables and sell them. I even take my neighbours’ vegetables and sell them in the market,” said Sada. “I go to the market every alternate day and earn around Rs 800 to Rs 1,200 a day. It is a good income for an uneducated woman like me.” Another 41-year-old woman, Aaso Devi Aada from the same community, has also been making a living by selling vegetables. She used to work in a field earlier but the earnings she made was not enough to feed her family, she says.“After I started farming and selling vegetables commercially, my economic condition got better. Women in the community, including me, have developed the habit of saving money, which was next to impossible while working for somebody else,” said Aaso Devi.Not only Anita and Aaso but the majority of women from the Musahar settlement at Piluwaha in Kalyanpur Municipality-9 are now involved in commercial vegetable farming. This has been made possible due to the vocational training and assistance provided by Mukti Nepal, a social organisation, to the Musahar women. Mukti Nepal formed Gulab Women's Group to conduct vocational training for the socio-economic development of the marginalised community and provided three months commercial vegetable farming training to the women of the village. After receiving training, the women leased 18 kathas of land (around 65,610 square feet) near their settlement and started growing vegetables. As all the vegetables grown by them could not be consumed in the local settlements, the women started selling their products in the local markets in Dumari, Kalyanpur, Mirchaiya and Radhopur.According to Manju Kumari Sada, chairperson of Gulab Women's Group, women from the Musahar community have saved nearly Rs 40,000 from selling vegetables. The group invests the savings in vegetable farming and also provides loans at cheaper interest rates to those in need. The women have also started sending children to school and are raising awareness in the community to ban the consumption and sale of alcohol.“After the women in the community started growing and selling vegetables, they did not have to go to the landlords and contractors for employment,” said Manju.Ashok Kumar Kamati, district coordinator of Mukti Nepal, said that the entire Musahar settlement has benefited from the commercial farming training.“The women have gained independence and this has brought about social and economic changes in the society,” said Kamati. There are 34 houses in the Dalit Musahar settlement.","Published at : February 27, 2022",Siraha,Bharat Jargha Magar
Irrigation project in Parsa left in limbo,"An irrigation project that aims to water around 2,100 hectares of land in Parsa district has been left in limbo.Construction work of Ghore Masan Shitalpur Irrigation Project has been halted for the past eight years as Parsa National Park has not been cooperating in the project’s completion. The irrigation project kicked off in the fiscal year 2015-16 with an aim to irrigate 2,100 hectares of land in Ward No 5 of Thori Rural Municipality and wads 1, 2 and 5 of Jira Bhawani Rural Municipality.According to Jari Lama, chairman of the then Subarna VDC, the project came to a halt as the Parsa National Park did not give permission to carry out Environmental Impact Assessment.“Since the intake of the irrigation project lies in the core area of the protected area, we need the park’s support and permission to complete the project,” said Lama.The irrigation project plans to bring water from the Ghode Masan stream that passes through the national park by constructing a 25 kilometre-long canal.“We spent a large amount of money to construct a pond for water diversion as building a dam inside the national park was not allowed. A total of Rs 13.6 million provided by the government has already been spent in the irrigation project. But the consumers’ committee could not continue work without the permission of the national park,” said Lama. He urged the authorities concerned to take the necessary initiatives and complete the project that will greatly benefit local farmers.The federal government released Rs 13.6 million for the irrigation project in the fiscal year 2015-16. The project kicked off soon after.“Construction of the canal outside the national park was going on in full swing but we could not work inside the national park,” said Surya Koirala, secretary of the consumers’ committee. “The water resources and irrigation ministry wrote to the national park, urging it to conduct an environmental impact assessment of the irrigation project. But the national park did not take any initiatives.” Meanwhile, Santosh Bhagat, the spokesperson of Parsa National Park, says he is not aware of the issue. “I got posted here only a few months ago. I can speak about it only after I talk about the issue with other park officials,” said Bhagat.","Published at : February 22, 2022",Parsa,Shankar Acharya
Musahar people lag behind in vaccination,"Rukmati Devi Majhi, a 58-year-old woman from the Musahar community in Chandrapur Municipality-9, is unaware about the vaccination drive against coronavirus. Rukmati and her entire family are yet to be vaccinated against Covid-19.Not only Rukmati and her family but most people in the Musahar settlement are unaware about the ongoing vaccination drive against Covid-19.“Covid-19 cannot kill us. If we are going to die, no vaccine can save us. That’s why we are not interested in the vaccination process,” said Rukmati. “There are 70 households in the village and until now, not a single person has contracted the virus. A few people suffered from colds and fever but nobody went for a checkup.” Most people in the Musahar community don’t know what the vaccine does or where and when to get it. Despite the provision of vaccination in schools, Musahar children are deprived of it as they have stopped going to school.The majority of the people in another Musahar community in Gajura Municipality-9 have also been deprived of vaccines. There are 119 households in this impoverished community with almost 200 children. “The government has started inoculating all children aged 12 to 17 at school. But the children of this community don't go to school,” said health workers.According to Nathuni Majhi, a Musahar community leader, people in his community go to work in brick kilns and have poor economic conditions. They have neither the time nor the awareness to get vaccinated, he said. “Only 20 percent of the total population in my community are vaccinated,” said Majhi.According to the data of the District Administration Office, Gaur, 119 people have died due to Covid-19 in Rautahat district. “The total population of the district is 586,000, out of which 45 percent is vaccinated. Most of the unvaccinated people are from the Dalit community,” said Suresh Yadav, chief of Gaur Health Office. Yadav said that the health office is deploying mobile teams in villages targeting Dalits and those who do not come for vaccination.Health workers say that the authorities need to raise awareness on the importance of vaccines against Covid-19. “Most of the unvaccinated people in the district come from the Dalit community, including Musahar and Dom,” health workers say.The Musahar community rely on agriculture, fishing and labour to make a living.According to Prakash Musahar, a leader of the Musahar community, after the authorities launched awareness programmes, a few people from his community got vaccinated. But a majority remain unvaccinated, he said. There are 60 small and large Musahar settlements across Rautahat district with 2,050 houses and a total population of around 20,000. Musahar people are deprived of most government services due to a lack of education and poor economic conditions.","Published at : February 14, 2022",Rautahat,Shiva Puri
Test run conducted successfully for Kurtha-Jayanagar railway service,"The much-awaited Kurtha-Jayanagar railway service conducted a test run on Sunday.According to the Nepal Railway Company, a train was operated along the tracks to test the condition of the physical infrastructure and manage security arrangements to make the railway service safe. The engine was run without passengers. Only the railway employees, security personnel, people’s representatives and media persons were on board.“The train successfully ran from Jayanagar of India to Kurtha of Dhanusha during the test ride. The dry run will be continued until the prime ministers of Nepal and India jointly inaugurate the service,” said Niranjan Jha, general manager at the Nepal Railway Company. “We started the dry run to give a clear message to people that the railway service won’t be stopped under any pretext. It will also be helpful to find security lapses along the railway, train the employees and make them responsible and find out the daily operation cost to run the train,” said Jha.The train ran at the speed of 40 kilometres per hour. “The train had to be stopped at several places. The domesticated animals of the local farmers are found crossing the railway tracks. Efforts are on to inform local people not to let their animals come to the railway tracks,” said Enayet Hussein, the deputy general manager of India’s Konkan Railways Corporation Ltd that has been providing technical support to operate railway service in Nepal.Preparations are on to inaugurate the railway service in February last week. Inauguration had been planned on several dates earlier but that was not possible due to various delays including the Covid-19 pandemic.On September 18, 2020, two brand new train sets arrived at Janakpur station amid much fanfare. Nepal had bought them at a cost of Rs846.5 million. But as their operation was delayed and both the trains were kept parked covered by tarps for about 17 months. The tarpaulin covers of the two train sets parked at Inaruwa Railway station in Janakpur were removed after 476 days a month ago.After the formation of the Sher Bahadur Deuba government in July last year, general manager of the company Guru Prasad Bhattarai and around 150 staffers recruited by the erstwhile KP Oli-led government were removed. Though the government decided to appoint 186 employees to operate the railway service there are only 59 employees currently working at the company.India’s Konkan Railways Corporation Ltd should provide 26 of its technical staff for a year to operate the railway service as per a bilateral agreement. “Fourteen of them have already arrived while 12 will arrive after the inauguration of the service,” said Jha.","Published at : February 14, 2022",Dhanusha,Santosh Singh
27-year-old woman burnt to death in Saptari,"A 27-year-old woman died of burn injuries at Badebarsain Municipality-1 in Sapari district on Saturday night.Prameshwar Sah allegedly doused petrol on his sister-in-law Raj Kumari Sah and set her ablaze while the latter was preparing a meal in their residence on Friday. The victim, who sustained critical burn injuries, died in the course of treatment at Max Hospital in Biratnagar on Saturday. According to the hospital, the victim sustained burns to 80 percent of her body in the incident.“I was in Barsain Bazaar when the incident took place. The neighbours immediately gathered and tried to douse the fire when she cried for help. I reached home when one of my neighbours called me. Almost all of her body was burnt when I reached home. We rushed her to Biratnagar but could not save her life,” said Rabin Sah, Raj Kumari’s husband. According to Rabin, his three-year-old daughter, who was near her mother, also sustained minor burn injuries in the incident.Preliminary investigation shows that Prameshwar brought a litre of petrol and poured it on Raj Kumari. His wife is currently visiting her family with her newborn. There were no adults at home when the incident took place, police said.The two brothers, along with their wives and children, live with their mother at Dhangadhi settlement in Badebarsain-1. Prameshwar is currently unemployed. According to family members, the two brothers had an argument two days before the incident when Rabin accused Prameshwar of being lazy. The investigation officers suspect that the incident might have taken place due to personal vendetta.Prameshwar fled the village soon after the incident. Rabin lodged a complaint with the police demanding the arrest of his brother and legal action against him. “We are searching for the suspect. Detailed investigation into the case is underway,” said Deputy Superintendent of Police Madhav Prasad Kafle. Burns are the second most common injury in rural Nepal, accounting for 5 percent of disabilities, according to the World Health Organisation. Women's rights organisations say that beating and burning are the two most common forms of domestic violence in the country.","Published at : February 7, 2022",Rajbiraj,Abdesh Kumar Jha
Strong winds claim three lives in Madhes Pradesh,"At least three people were killed following a windstorm in Madhes Pradesh on Friday.According to the Provincial Police Office, two students in Sabaila of Dhanusa district and one woman in Rautahat died in accidents caused by the windstorm.Superintendent of Police Tul Bahadur Karki, spokesperson at the Province Police Office in Janakpur, informed that two boys, aged 8 and 12, died after a tree fell on them in the premises of Fakirchand Secondary School in Dhanusa.“Both of the victims died on the spot,” said DSP Jitendra Basnet of the Dhanusa Police.In Rautahat, a 45-year-old woman, a resident of Ajgaiwi in Baudhimai Municipality, died after her house collapsed on her during the windstorm.

Poachers call the shots in Rautahat forests for lack of monitoring,"An injured blue bull (Boselaphus tragocamelus) was found near Bakya river at Chandranigahapur Division Forest in Dewahi Gonahi Municipality, Rautahat last Thursday.The Chandranigahapur Division Forest is spread across all 18 municipalities of Rautahat and is divided into seven sub sectors—Chetnagar, Judibela, Hiley Khola, Dhansar, Jungle Saiya, Chocha and Banbohari. The head office of the Division Forest Office is located in Chandranigahapur Municipality. The injured bull was rescued by a joint team of forest officials and local police and sent to Parsa National Park for treatment and rehabilitation. The location where the injured bull was found is around 115 km from the national park. According to Amar Dev Yadav, acting chief of the Division Forest Office, the bull has sustained injuries from spear stabs on his eyes and back.The attacker must have wounded the bull while it was grazing by the Bakya river, says Yadav. “The injured blue bull is being treated at Parsa National Park and will be released inside the park after recovery,” said Yadav. “We are aware of illegal poaching activities in the area but the division forest alone cannot stand up to armed poachers. Although our forest rangers monitor the forest areas, it’s not possible to keep track of all activities in the forest,” he said. According to the Division Forest Office, poachers set up ambushes using guns, spears and traps to capture blue bulls, wild boars, deer, and other wild animals who come out of the forest and to the nearest fields to graze. “Blue bull is being hunted for its meat. Poachers sell its meat in the local market as deer meat,” said Yadav. “A week and a half ago, a forest patrol team in the Chetnagar area came across a group of armed poachers with a dead wild boar. They were in the process of butchering the bull when we found them.”According to people living around the Chetnagar area, poachers are killing wild animals every day and are most active in the western part of the ​​Chandranigahapur Division Forest. “During this season, wild animals, including blue bull, wild boar and deer, come out of the forest to graze in the pastures. That’s when the poachers hunt them,” said Yadav.Civil society leader from Rautahat Saput Bahadur Karki demands strict action against poachers for the conservation of wildlife in forest areas. “We cannot control illegal activities in the forest if we do not take strict action against poachers and those who sell wild animal parts. Wild animals are being killed every day and shops are selling their meat out in the open. This butchery has to stop,” said Karki.According to Karki, a meeting was recently held among Nepal Army, Nepal Police and Armed Police Force at the Division Forest Office to discuss possible measures to curb the poaching of wild animals in the forest. But the meeting did not bear tangible results, he said. “They only talked about the issue but did not decide any concrete measures to stop poaching in the forests,” he said. According to forest officials, a month ago, three hunting rifles were recovered from Chocha and Banbohari forest areas. Several wild animals were shot although the forest office does not have any data on the actual number of killings. On April 15, 2021, a forest team had recovered three hunting rifles from the same area. The availability of weapons has emboldened the poachers to continue with illegal activities, says Amar Dev Yadav from the Division Forest Office. “Unless the authorities curb the production and use of illegal weapons, it will be difficult to stop the poachers,” said Yadav.Two decades ago, Dron Prasad Neupane, subedar of the Armed Forest Guard, and Bhoj Bahadur Ghimire, a forest ranger at the then District Forest Office in Chandranigahapur Municipality, were shot dead by poachers. “The forest rangers are not equipped to deal with armed poachers,” said Yadav. “Monitoring forest areas is a risky task and it needs the involvement of armed security personnel. The dry season, when the forests experience wildfires, is when the poachers are most active. The wildfires drive the animals out of the forest cover and into the open, exposing them to poachers lying in wait. Immediate measures need to be taken if we are to stop poachers from killing wild animals this dry season.”","Published at : February 2, 2022",Rautahat,Shiva Puri
Haphazard excavation of riverbed continues in Sarlahi,"The haphazard extraction of riverbed materials from Lalkhandehi river has resulted in unchecked deforestation and floods in Lalbandi Municipality of Sarlahi. However, the authorities have failed to keep a check on the illegal excavation of riverbed materials from the area.The local unit says it does not have the data on the exact amount of riverbed materials extracted from the river last year. “I am not aware of any illegal activities in the area,” said Basudev Timalsina, acting chief administrative officer of the municipality. But a field visit conducted by a monitoring team on Thursday found the contractor flouting the excavation standards set forth in the contract, according to technical engineer Roshan Pandit of Lalbandi. “The local unit has banned excavation in the area for now,” claimed Pandit. Illegal excavation in the Lakhandehi area had led to the loss of almost 2.5 hectares of land at Nandeshwor Community Forest in Lalbandi Municipality-1, Nawalpur last year. About 10,000 saplings planted in the forest were washed away by floods in June. Nawalpur settlement itself was at high risk of floods. “The entire Nawalpur settlement was at risk of being swept away by floods last year,” Roshan Neupane, a resident of Nawalpur, told the Post. “The upcoming rainy season too will be dangerous for those living here.” “Last year, those living close to Lakhandehi river and those who depend on the Nandeshwor Community Forest for their livelihood had to face the consequences of illegal excavations in the river,” said Neupane. “The forest cover has saved Nawalpur settlement from being swept away by floods so far but deforestation has thinned the forest cover in the past few years. The people's representatives and government officials have been colluding with the contractors for profit. That’s why no action has been taken to stop the unchecked excavation of riverbed materials.”Uday Bahadur Karki, chairman of the community forest users group, says the local authorities, including the people’s representatives, have ignored their concerns over the illegal excavation in the river. Thursday’s report has come as a relief to the community forest users group but more efforts must be made to conserve the river, says Karki.“The contractors have been engaging in illegal activities, endangering the forest and depleting its resources,” said Karki. “We are protesting against illegal excavation and illegal settlers.”The lack of monitoring and accountability has emboldened the contractors to continue destroying the forest area and the river, locals say.A contractor is allowed to dig only up to 5 feet into the riverbed during extraction. However, last year, Mechi Mahakali Company had dug up to 10 to 15 feet. This year, the contract has been awarded to Jalkeshwar Construction and they have dug as deep as 20 to 25 feet, according to Karki. The contract was signed on October 8 last year for Rs 2.5 million. The Environment Impact Assessment conducted before the signing of the contract had allowed the extraction of 651,354 cubic metres of sand and pebbles from a depth of 1.5 metres. “But Jalkeshwar Construction were extracting stones and sand five times more than mentioned in the agreement,” said Karki.","Published at : January 31, 2022",Sarlahi,Om Prakash Thakur
Sweet hopes of bringing Birgunj Sugar Mill back to life turn bitter,"Hopes of bringing the state-owned Birgunj Sugar Mill back to life have receded for lack of government will.Once a flourishing public enterprise, the factory has been shuttered since 2003 after a succession of incompetent political appointees ran it into the ground.The government has several times decided to operate the mill under a cooperative model, a move largely aimed at dismantling the monopoly of the sugar cartels. But months and years have passed, and nothing has happened.All the company's property, including factory machinery, furniture and buildings, are in a dilapidated state. The company started on its path to ruin on February 16, 2000 when the Cabinet decided to privatise it. The factory was eventually shut down on February 23, 2003. Birgunj Sugar Mill was established in 1964 with aid from the then Soviet Union. It is spread over 65 bighas (44 hectares) in Birgunj of Parsa district.During its heyday, the factory employed up to 2,200 workers. It had the capacity to crush 1,500 tonnes of sugarcane and produce 1.5 tonnes of sugar and 4,500 litres of rectified spirit per day. After the closure of the factory, 731 permanent employees were given compulsory retirement. However, 193 employees declined to resign. Nor did they accept their severance pay. They rather filed a lawsuit at the Supreme Court demanding payment of their salaries and other benefits, arguing that the remuneration provided by the government was too low. Although the disgruntled workers have held several rounds of talks with the government, no solution has been found.The government still pays the salaries of 17 employees who look after the mill, all of whom have been appointed on a contract basis. The government spends about Rs350,000 on their salaries monthly.The factory's land is being fragmented. The government has given 6 bighas on the south side to the Armed Police Force. Two years ago, it decided to give 4 bighas of temporary land in Birgunj and 2 bighas of land to the Office of the High Court for the construction of a building.The High Court has been operating on the factory premises for the last four years. The company also owns 30 ropanis and a building in Baluwatar, Kathmandu. Awadh Kishore Singh, administration manager of the factory, said that the Ministry of Finance had given the building and land to construct an office building of the National Planning Commission.The mill has another 2 bighas (1.35 hectares) of land, including the service centre and its building, at various places in Bara and Parsa. Singh, who was once a permanent employee of the factory, is currently serving under a contract basis. “The factory had to face a financial crisis and eventually it was closed down,” Singh recalls. “It suffered a financial crisis immediately after Rs100 million was distributed from the reserve fund of the mill to 700 employees who got retired.”According to him, the government decided to shut down the mill that was in operation. “If the government had thought about the future of the factory and its needs, the mill probably wouldn’t have died,” he said.When the factory was in operation, it used to buy sugarcane from 12,000 to 15,000 farmers.As sugarcane was a cash crop, it had a big impact on the living standard of farmers. The factory was taking care of 2,000 employees’ families, and after its closure, many families fell on hard times. The big losers were the sugarcane farmers.Saharum Raut, a sugarcane farmer of Parsa, said that private sugar mills started to operate after the closure of Birgunj Sugar Mill.Sugarcane farmers hoped that their good days would return with the opening of a series of private mills. But the private mills gave the sugarcane farmers a hard time. “These mills have been harassing farmers for years. They don’t pay on time,” said Raut. “Many farmers frustrated by the mills stopped cultivating sugarcane.”Raut said that if the government reopens Birgunj Sugar Mill, it will greatly benefit the farmers.Around 2,000 families in the area were operating hotels, shops and businesses. The factory was making an annual profit of around Rs60 million till 1993, except during the initial two to three years of operation. But soon after the government started to make political appointments and send people with barely any experience, the collapse of the mill was inevitable, former employees say. In 1990, the government decided to inject Rs200 million into the mill, but the money was never released.Then in 2003, the Ministry of Finance invited bids to privatise the factory. However, the privatisation process never bore fruit due to political instability and frequent changes in government.After the Maoist government came to power, the then prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal had planned to put the factory back into operation. A team of experts was sent to the factory to study its condition. They submitted a report to the then finance minister Baburam Bhattarai but nothing was done. When Anil Jha was industry minister, a steering committee was formed under the leadership of Raj Kumar Singh. However, the committee could not do anything. At the same time, leaders affiliated with various parties started protests and organised demonstrations for the re-operation of the factory in Birgunj. That struggle too failed.“There are many reports on the shelves of the Finance Ministry. None of the recommendations has been studied,” Singh said.He said that no committee had been able to say clearly which modality was suitable for the re-operation of the factory.Engineer Baijunath Rauniyar, a resident of Birgunj Ghantaghar, said that it was unfortunate that no government could take concrete steps to reopen Birgunj Sugar Mill despite repeated assurances. ""The physical assets of the factory are still very safe. The government should have the will to reopen it,” he said. ""The government should make long-term plans. All three levels of government need to be serious about this matter.”","Published at : January 30, 2022",Parsa,Shankar Acharya
"Province 2 endorses Madhes as its name, Janakpurdham as provincial capital","The assembly meeting of Province 2 on Monday endorsed the proposal to name the province Madhes by a two-thirds majority. The assembly also designated Janakpurdham as its provincial capital. The separate proposals for the name and capital were presented in the assembly meeting for voting.

Similarly, 78 votes were cast in favour of Janakpurdham as the provincial headquarters.Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal (JSPN), Loktantrik Samajbadi Party Nepal (LSPN) and CPN (Maoist Centre) jointly registered the proposal to name the province Madhes at the provincial assembly. CPN-UML and CPN (Unified Socialist) proposed to name the province Janaki and make Janakpur its capital while Nepali Congress had proposed to name the province as Mithila-Bhojpura and designate Janakpurdham asits capital. The provincial assembly members representing Bara and Parsa districts were in favour of Madhes as the name of the province but proposed to designate Birgunj as the provincial capital.The 107-member provincial assembly currently has 104 members, including Speaker Saroj Yadav. Ninety-nine members were present in the assembly meeting on Monday. The JSPN and LSPN have 37 and 16 members respectively in the provincial assembly while the Maoist Centre has eight members. But a total of 80 votes were cast in favour of Madhes Province proposed jointly by these three parties.A highly placed source claimed that some members of the Congress and CPN (Unified Socialist) crossed the floor and voted in favour of Madhes Province. “Around 89 Congress provincial assembly members and two CPN (Unified Socialist) members favoured our proposal to name the province Madhes. The political parties who were in favour of the proposal did not have a two-thirds majority,” said a LSPN provincial assembly member preferring anonymity. Upendra Prasad Kushawaha, whip of the Nepali Congress in the provincial assembly, admitted that some Congress members crossed the floor. “Though I stood firm on the party’s agenda as the whip, some Congress members crossed the floor,” he added.The province spanning eight districts is the smallest in area with the highest population density. It got its name nearly four years after the provincial assembly election. Of the seven provinces in the country, only Province 1 remains to be named.","Published at : January 17, 2022",Janakpur,Ajit Tiwari						 &

He was murdered for his fight to save environment. Justice eludes his family two years on,"January 10, 2020. It was a Friday. When Omprakash (Dilip) Mahato came to know that loaders and tipper trucks had arrived at the Aurahi river in Sripur of Dhanusha to excavate the riverbed, he went out of the house. Dilip had been protesting against the illegal extraction of river materials that had been going on for quite a while. But that day, when he protested, the tipper truck ran over him. Police investigation confirmed that Dilip was killed on the premises of the crusher factory and then crushed under a truck on the bank of the Aaurahi river.For the last two years, Dilip’s family has been seeking justice, to no avail. “Our fight for justice has completed two years. The murderers are roaming freely,” said his sister Laxmi. “Nobody dares to challenge them.”The truck belonged to Churiya Mai Sand Processing Industry. For the locals from his village in Dhanusa’s Mithila Municipality, Dilip’s fight against sand and stone mining wasn’t new. On several occasions he had received death threats from Bipin Kumar Mahato, owner of the sand processing factory, and his team.However, Dilip and his family did not think Bipin actually meant to carry out his threat. Dilip, 24, had returned home after his exam of the final semester of engineering in Bhopal, India. He had reached the riverside at around four in the morning to stop Bipin, after finding that his team was illegally excavating sand and stones.Bipin, his brother Binod and workers of the factory including Munindra Mahato, Jitendra Mahato, Satyanarayan Mahato, Shatrudhan Mahato and Dilip's own friend Roshan Kumar Yadav brutally stabbed Dilip in various parts of his body with a lever and a screwdriver. After Dilip fell unconscious, they ran a truck (Na7Kha,6413) over his head in an attempt to make it look like a road accident.  Tufan Neupane/TKPHad the judiciary functioned as per its fourth five-year strategic plan that envisioned resolving all the cases registered at district courts within two years, Dilip’s family would have already received justice. That would have meant Bipin and the other six would have been in jail.However, Ramjeevan, his father, continues to fight for justice even today.A case was registered on February 5 that year at Dhanusha District Court claiming that Dilip was tortured to death and demanding that all seven accused be sentenced to life in prison. Clause 41 of the Criminal Code, 2074, provides for the imprisonment for anyone who brutally tortures someone to death.Despite the indictment, District Judge Keshav Prasad Ghimire ordered that only Bipin and his employees Munindra and Ranjit be kept in custody until the case was decided and Roshan, Satyanarayana and Shatrudhan be released on Rs25,000 bail each.Binod, another operator of the factory, who appeared before the court after almost a year of absconding, got an order from the district court on October 12, 2020 to be released without bail.The Office of the High Government Attorney challenged the district court’s verdict at Janakpur High Court. A division bench of judges Hari Prasad Bagale and Ramesh Dhakal, however, upheld all the orders of the district court on December 17, 2020. A petition was filed at the Supreme Court against this and an order was issued to call for a report on February 5, 2020. At present, only three of the seven accused in Dilip's murder are in jail and four others are roaming free. The Aurahi riverbank where the man was run over by a truck.  Tufan Neupane/TKPInstead, Binod in April last year filed a case against Ramjivan, Dilip’s mother Chandrakala Devi and two sisters Sangam Kumari, 22, and Laxmi, 20, claiming that they interfered in the operation of the sand processing factory.The factory stopped operation after Bipin was sent to custody and Binod absconded while environmentalists and local residents protested against its operation.On April 4, 2021, a single bench of judge Ujjwal Shukla issued a show cause notice in the name of both parties.The decision came as another tragedy to Ramjeevan, his wife and two daughters, who were fighting for justice. They rushed to the police station and court to make a statement.""Because I don't know how to write myself, I have to find a lawyer. He had to be paid,” said Ramjeevan. “The person who should be facing legal action has added to our troubles by filing the court case.”The sand processing factory was operating against the standards set by the government. The factory, which has been excavating and extracting riverine products without paying taxes and without the permission of the authorities, had not taken into account the negative impact of its operations on people’s health, public life and the environment.  Tufan Neupane/TKPAccording to the Preliminary Environmental Examination Report prepared three years ago by Mithila Municipality for the management of factories operating in the city on the basis of on-site monitoring and inspection, Churiyamai Sand Processing Industry excavated more than specified resources and extracted stones and sand from prohibited areas.The chargesheet against seven people in Dilip's murder has also demanded confiscation of the equipment used in the crime and associated property. However, on April 13, 2021, a division bench of judges Lekhnath Ghimire and Ramesh Dhakal issued an interim order in favour of the factory.“Do not interfere in the operation of the factory by doing something not authorized by the law,"" read the order issued in the name of Dilip's family.Laxmi, Dilip’s sister, said instead of bringing the culprits to book, the court issued an order against the family, within 11 days from the date a case was filed.“They won, and we lost,” said Laxmi. “How can we stop the operation of these plants owned by such powerful people?”Dilip’s family claims Bipin, Binod and his supporters are piling pressure on them.“My brother sacrificed his life fighting for the environment. Now the condition of the river has deteriorated further. Stones, pebbles and sand are being extracted more vigorously. Nepal's law favours those who have pockets full of money,” said Sangam Kumari.  Tufan Neupane/TKPThe case related to Dilip's murder is being heard by Dhanusha District Judge Dhurba Raj Karki. According to the records of the district court, the case was listed for hearing five times between April 13 and December 22 last year, but no hearing has taken place.Despite losing their brother in a fight to save the environment, Sangam Kumari and Laxmi have taken forward the work of Dilip.On September 16, 2020, Omprakash (Dilip) Mahato Environment Foundation led by Sangam was registered to carry out conservation works. It recently received Rs1.5 million for conservation from the President Chure Tarai Madhes Conservation Committee.“My brother sacrificed his life to save the environment,” said Sangam. “His dream will come true, if we are able to contribute even a little to this mission. That’s what motivates us.”Santosh Singh contributed reporting from Janakpur.","Published at : January 10, 2022",Dhanusha,Tufan Neupane
Train sets tested on Kurtha-Jayanagar track after 16 months,"The tarpaulin covers of the two train sets parked at Inaruwa Railway station in Janakpur were removed after 476 days as the sets were operated on the railway track on Saturday for testing the railway service.The two machines travelled from the parking station to Kurtha, which is part of the Nepal India Cross-Border Railway connecting Kurtha in Nepal to the bordering Indian town of Jayanagar. “These rail sets were operated for testing to see if their engine, batteries, wheels, piston, generator and lubricants were in order ahead of a formal resumption of the railway service,” said Niranjan Jha, general manager of the Nepal Railway Company, which is responsible for the operations. Crew members from India’s Konkan Railways Corporation Ltd, which is set to provide 26 of its technical staff for one year to resume the railway service as per a bilateral agreement, operated the trains on Saturday.On September 18, 2020, the two brand new train sets arrived at Janakpur station amid fanfare. The country had bought them at a cost of Rs846.5 million, only to be abandoned at Inaruwa Railway station for nearly 16 months as the government was not adequately prepared for their operations.Jha said regular railway service would start by mid-February, claiming that all the preparations have been done. He told the Post last month that the company planned to start operations by mid-January but they are yet to recruit staff to operate the service.After the formation of the Sher Bahadur Deuba government in July last year, general manager of the company Guru Prasad Bhattarai was removed, among other 150 officials recruited by the KP Sharma Oli administration. But months after their removal, the new administration is yet to start a fresh recruitment process. New recruits need to be trained to work at track stations and as signal staff.“The railway service can begin once manpower is recruited and trained,” said Deepak Kumar Bhattarai, director general of the Department of Railways. “These tasks should be done at the earliest to resume cross-border passenger railway service.”The Nepal Railway Company administration had failed to start the railway service even though staff were recruited early last year. The Indian company had not handed over the railway infrastructure to Nepal and the standard operating procedure for cross-border operations was also not signed between Nepal and India. Niranjan Jha, general manager of the Railway Company, told the Post last month that the staff hiring process had not been initiated due to uncertainty over the company's budget.“Our board has not passed the company’s annual budget. Until a budget is approved, we cannot hire staff or sign contracts,” Jha had said. The budget endorsement was delayed after the Finance Ministry notified the company that no budget had been earmarked for the company.The Post’s efforts to contact him for updates did not materialise immediately.On January 4, a group of officials from India’s Ministry of Railways and Ministry of External Affairs came to Nepal on an observation visit of the railway track and the trains.“They concluded that the track is okay for railway service operation. They also checked the train engines and found them to be in good condition,” said Bhattarai. Saturday’s test came a few days later. Nepal and India signed the standard operating procedure for railway service in October last year. The Indian contractor, IRCON International Ltd, officially handed over the Kurtha-Jayanagar section of the railway infrastructure to Nepal later that month.The government on December 1 introduced an ordinance for the second time to facilitate the setting up of institutional and operational mechanisms such as the railway board, administrative chief and railway staff, and fare determination system.","Published at : January 9, 2022",Janakpur,Shyam Sundar Sashi
At least 16 injured as Janamat Party cadres clash with security personnel in Dhanusa,"A clash ensued between police personnel and cadres of Janamat Party after the latter tried to obstruct the East-West Highway at Godar Chowk in Ganeshman Charnath Municipality, Dhanusa district on Sunday.According to police, eight security personnel including seven Nepal Police personnel and one Armed Police Force personnel were injured in the clash. Likewise, eight cadres of the CK Raut-led party have also been injured. Of them, three have sustained injuries from rubber bullets fired by the police. Police fired 11-round of rubber bullets and 16-round of tear gas in an effort to bring the situation under control. However, tensions are still high at Godar chowk as clashes between the protesters and security personnel threaten to turn more violent. The Janamat Party cadres had taken to the streets armed with canes obstructing vehicular movement along the highway when the police intervened leading to the clashes.","Published at : January 2, 2022",Dhanusa,Santosh Singh
Province 2 expedites process to fix its name and headquarters,"The longstanding dispute over the name and headquarters of Province 2 is finally headed towards resolution as the provincial assembly has expedited the process to take a decision shortly.While the parties have largely agreed on Janakpurdham for provincial headquarters, their differences over the name for the province has delayed the decision. Janata Samajbadi Party wants Province 2 to be named Madhes. Loktantrik Samajbadi Party and the CPN (Maoist Centre) have backed the proposal by the party that is leading the provincial government.Nepali Congress, one of the ruling parties, has proposed Mithila-Bhojpura while the CPN-UML wants the province to be named Janaki. The CPN (Unified Socialist) backs the UML proposal. The then Nepal Communist Party (NCP) too had proposed Janaki as the name for the province. But after the NCP split—eventually into three parties, the Maoist Centre has backed the proposal of the two Madhes-based parties, thus increasing the possibility for the name Madhes.Political parties held a series of discussions on the two issues last year. After efforts at consensus failed, the provincial assembly had announced that the name and headquarters would be decided through a vote on March 13, 2020. But the vote was deferred after the parties sought more time for discussion.Twenty-one months later, a committee led by provincial Speaker Saroj Yadav was formed on Tuesday to discuss the issues and reach a conclusion. “We have two weeks to decide on the matter,” Sanjay Kumar Yadav, a member of the committee from the Jananta Samajbadi Party, told the Post. “We believe the decision will be taken through consensus. Or else we will go to a vote.” The committee on Thursday formed its working procedure with a plan to complete its task within the deadline.The leaders from a cross-section of parties who are members in the Speaker-led committee say they have a common understanding that there should be no further delay in naming and fixing the provincial headquarters. Province 2 is the only province that remains undecided over both the name and the provincial headquarters. Province 1 has fixed its headquarters but is still struggling on a name. The remaining five provinces have already fixed their permanent headquarters and names.Following a split in the NCP, the possibility of the province being named Madhes has grown stronger as the Maoist Centre has also thrown its weight behind Madhes.The Janata Samajbadi Party has 39 provincial assembly members including Speaker and deputy Speaker in the provincial assembly while Loktantrik Samajbadi Party has 16 and the Moist Centre 8.A two-thirds majority is necessary, as per the constitutional provision, to permanently fix the name and headquarters. The three parties have 63 members in the provincial assembly which is six votes short of a two-thirds majority.A support of 69 provincial assembly members is necessary in the 104-strong assembly. The Speaker, however, can only cast a decisive vote.The CPN (Unified Socialist) says it is flexible on the name. “We aren’t rigid on our proposal. There are grounds for a compromise,” Shatrudhan Mahato, a provincial assembly member from the Unified Socialist, told the Post. “Let us see how the discussions move ahead.”The Unified Socialist has 13 members in the provincial assembly. The name Madhes Province will be swiftly endorsed if the Unified Socialist backs the name, even if another ruling party Nepali Congress and the opposition CPN-UML oppose the name. The Congress has 19 provincial assembly members while the UML has just eight.“We are already late in naming and fixing the headquarters. Except for some provincial assembly members from Parsa district, others are ready for Janakpurdham as the headquarters. There are some differences over the name,” Surita Kumari Sah, a member of the committee from the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party, told the Post. “We must go for a vote if there is no consensus.”There are 14 provincial assembly members belonging to several parties from Parsa. “As the name and headquarters are sensitive issues, we are for deciding them in consensus,” Sharada Devi Thapa, a UML member in the provincial Speaker-led committee, told the Post.","Published at : January 2, 2022",Kathmandu,Binod Ghimire
Birgunj sets up medical waste management centre,"Birgunj Metropolitan City has built a medical waste management centre to mitigate the possible health hazards caused by the careless disposal of medical waste.The metropolis spent Rs62.2 million to set up the Green Hospital Waste Management Centre, which will come into operation in the next few weeks, according to Nischal Raj Pandey, the chief administrative officer at the metropolitan city. Birgunj, a medical hub of central Tarai districts, had no provision for medical waste disposal and would discard medical waste at landfill sites, risking the lives of sanitation workers and the local people.“Birgunj has been seeing a spurt of private health institutions so it was becoming increasingly necessary to build a medical waste management centre,” said Bijaya Kumar Sarabagi, the mayor of Birgunj metropolis, who inaugurated the centre constructed at Nagawa in Birgunj-16 on Monday.“Although the hospitals, while acquiring licenses, would promise to safely dispose of waste that they generated, we found that a majority of hospitals did not practice segregation and safe disposal of medical waste,” said Sarabagi. “It was turning into a major health risk for health sanitation workers and even for the local people.” The Green Hospital Waste Management Centre turns hazardous medical wastes into non-toxic ones and disposes of them, according to Prakash Adhikari, an engineer at the metropolitan city.  “Around 4.7 tonnes of medical waste is generated in Birgunj on a daily basis, out of which 2.7 tonnes are toxic waste,” he said. “The centre manages the toxic medical wastes through autoclave technology.”“The medical waste management centre has been established to safely decompose the wastes or recycle them,” said Adhikari, adding that 23 employees and some sanitation workers will be deployed at the centre once it comes into operation.According to mayor Sarabagi, the solid waste management centre has been established with the sole investment of the metropolitan city. The metropolis has purchased two mini trucks as well to collect the medical wastes. “The contractor of the landfill site will be given the responsibility to run the medical waste management centre for some time. The site will later be operated under the public-private partnership modality,” he said. The metropolitan city urges all hospitals and polyclinics to separate their toxic and non-toxic medical waste. “The sanitation workers will collect the medical waste from the hospitals. The health institutions must proactively help us in waste segregation,” said Sarabagi.There are two major hospitals—Narayani Hospital and National Medical College—and around a dozen private hospitals and polyclinics in Birgunj. Dr Birendra Pradhan, the acting medical superintendent at Narayani Hospital, admits the hospital’s shortcomings in managing its medical waste. “Waste management is a huge issue. But now with the metropolis’ initiative, we hope to bring an end to this problem,” he said.","Published at : December 16, 2021",Birgunj,Bhusan Yadav
Birgunj judicial committee sees decline in cases,"The judicial committee of Birgunj Metropolitan City in Parsa district has been without work of late as very few complaints are being lodged at the committee.As per the data available at the judicial committee, only six cases have been filed at the committee in the current fiscal year. “The number of cases filed at the committee is decreasing by the year,” said Dhan Bahadur Thapa, an advocate at the judicial committee. As many as 131 cases had been filed at the judicial committee when it was formed in the fiscal year 2017/18. In the fiscal year 2018/19, the committee received 79 cases while 58 and 13 cases were lodged in the fiscal years 2019/20 and 2020/21 respectively. A total of 287 cases have been filed at Birgunj's judicial committee since 2017. The committee said it has settled 122 cases so far while 165 others are pending. The metropolis’s judicial committee, led by Deputy Mayor Shanti Karki, has two other members—Baijayanti Mala and Tufel Akhtar.According to Thapa, in the initial days after the committee’s formation, people used to come and register cases without any proof or names of the claimant. “The number of cases started decreasing after the committee demanded proof, necessary documents and details of the claimants,” said Thapa. “Another reason behind the decline might be the lack of commitment from the judicial members. The committee’s members are the elected representatives of the people so they are often busy with administrative work and can’t give their full time to the committee.”The judicial committee also has problems in implementing its decision due to the non-cooperation of other concerned stakeholders, Thapa says.“The executive committee, police and other authorities concerned are responsible to implement the committee’s decisions. But they do not take their responsibility sincerely,” said Thapa.A lack of legal knowledge among the judicial committee members is another leading cause behind the committee’s decline, local residents say.Tufel Akhtar, one of the committee members, however, argues that the Covid-19 pandemic and the people’s representatives' role in settling disputes at the ward level have led to fewer cases being lodged at the judicial committee.There is a provision of a judicial committee in each local unit. The Local Government Operation Act 2017 clearly states the roles and duties of the local judicial committee. It has been empowered to settle disputes related to 13 specific matters, including property boundary disputes; disputes regarding canals, dams, ditches or allocation of water; encroachment on roads or way out; disputes about compensation for damage to crops; disputes about payment of wages; and disputes about lost and found cattle.","Published at : December 4, 2021",Birgunj,Shankar Acharya
Four police personnel among several injured during Nepali Congress ward convention in Sarlahi,"Several people including four police personnel were injured in a clash between security personnel and Nepali Congress cadres in Balra Municipality of Sarlahi district on Monday.The clash ensued over the election venue after the two factions of the party chose two different venues to hold the election. According to the police, in their effort to hold the ward election at their desired venues, the anti-establishment faction of the party tried to take election officer Umesh Chandra Jha to the ward office while the establishment faction wanted the election to take place at a local school in Gadhiya of the municipality.The police intervened and tried to escort Jha away from both the factions after the situation became tense. “The party cadres started pelting stones after we stopped them from forcibly taking the election officer to their desired venue,” said SP Krishna Prasain, “We fired a few shells of tear gas to bring the situation under control.”Prasain informed that Jha has sustained injuries to his head while Inspector Suresh Thakur and three other police personnel have sustained injuries during the clash.“The situation is under control as of now and the injured are receiving treatment at the District Hospital,” said Prasain. Federal lawmaker from the area Amresh Kumar Singh accused the police of using excessive force and injuring the party cadres. “The police have used excessive force and injured our party cadres,” said Singh, “This shows Home Minister Bal Krishna Khand’s derangement of power.”Earlier on Sunday, Province 2 Minister for Women, Children, Youth and Sports Birendra Singh’s bodyguard fired in the air after two factions of the party clashed during the party convention held at Achalgad of the same municipality.","Published at : November 29, 2021",Sarlahi,Om Prakash Thakur
Staff shortage hits service delivery in Rautahat offices,"A shortage of employees has hit almost all major government offices in Rautahat district, including hospitals, land revenue, irrigation, drinking water, road, prison and area administration offices to even the District Administration Office.According to Chief District Officer Krishna Bahadur Shahi, around 30 percent of posts in government offices have remained vacant for a while now. “Even at the District Administration Office, the posts of one assistant chief district officer, one administrative officer, four non-gazetted first-class officers and two non-gazetted second class officers are currently vacant,” said Shahi. “None of the government offices in Rautahat have employees as per the allocated posts. The employees transferred to Rautahat refuse their postings,” he said. According to him, 15 of the total 18 local units in Rautahat do not have under-secretaries at present.Most government offices, including public health institutions, have been unable to cater to service seekers who come every day for various purposes. On Monday, Sukadev Sah, a resident of Yamunamai Rural Municipality-4, was among the many who had come to the district land revenue office. He spent the entire day waiting at the office to get his work done. “It took me the whole day to register land at the district land revenue office. There was only a limited number of staff at the office and we had to spend hours waiting for our turn,” said Sah. “Registering land usually takes only about one hour when the office has staff. But now, the shortage of staff means we have to spend all day waiting for our turns.” Ram Krishna Uprety, chief at the district land revenue office, admitted to the service delay at his office owing to the shortage of employees. According to him, three posts of section officers and five posts of non-gazetted first-class officers are currently vacant at the office.At Gaur Hospital, ventilator and Intensive Care Unit services have been put on hold for the past year due to the lack of skilled human resources.“The hospital has 10 ICU beds and four ventilators but they have been left unused in the lack of specialist doctors,” said Krishna Shah, the chief at the hospital. “We repeatedly urged the higher authorities to send doctors and other health workers to fill the vacant posts but our requests went unheard. Because of the staff shortage, we had a tough time handling coronavirus cases during the second wave of the pandemic. We had to refer critical Covid-19 patients to other health institutions, as our ICU and ventilators could not be put to use,” said Shah. According to him, the hospital has not had doctors at full capacity for the past three years.The other departments at the hospital are also facing a shortage of human resources. The PCR lab of the Covid-19-designated hospital has a total of 14 posts but only five of them are occupied at present.The situation at the Division Forest Office is also the same. There are currently 90 employees at the office which has a total of 110 posts. Assistant Forest Officer Ram Prasad Sah said the office has been struggling to keep in check deforestation and timber smuggling due to the shortage of forest guards.","Published at : November 29, 2021",Rautahat,Shiva Puri
Malnutrition a cause for concern in Province 2,"Sachin Patel, the eight-year-old son of Rambabu and Shobha Devi Patel of Alau in Birgunj Metropolis-17, is malnourished and a patient of tuberculosis. The boy was diagnosed with malnutrition while receiving treatment for tuberculosis at Narayani Hospital. He was admitted to the Nutrition Rehabilitation Home (NRH) of the hospital on November 7. Gopal and Radhika Banarji’s six-year-old son and one-year-old daughter are also admitted at the rehabilitation home for malnourished children. The couple, residents of Bhagawatitol in Birgunj, is taking care of their four-year-old malnourished son at home.Similarly, the 16-month-old daughter of Raj Kumar Ram and Punam Devi from Itiyahi in Bara district was taken to the NRH on October 19. She weighed just 4kgs when she was brought to the centre. She was discharged after 27 days at 6.5kgs.The couple’s eldest daughter also suffered from severe malnutrition six years ago and had sought treatment at the same facility. Malnutrition among children is widely prevalent in Parsa and its neighbouring districts. Surprisingly, most of the malnutrition cases are from lower-middle-class families who have the ability to offer regular meals to their children.“Most of the malnourished children are from those families who can feed their children well. But what matters more is what kind of food they are giving their children,” said Sarita Yadav, programme coordinator of the NRH at the hospital.“People in this region eat more rice and lentils than green vegetables and legumes. They give the children the same diet. More than a lack of food, the reason behind malnutrition among children here is the absence of nutrition in their diet,” said Yadav. According to her, most families in the area eat potatoes for vegetables which have low nutritional value. “They do not feed their children milk, curd, eggs and meat. As a result, malnutrition has been a serious issue among children in the area,” she said. Working families in the area also rely heavily on junk food to feed their children, says Yadav. “Parents substitute well-balanced meals with noodles, biscuits, pakodas and such. The diet does not offer anything substantial to boost the health of young children,” she said.Malnutrition has been a serious health challenge in the region, according to experts, mainly due to the lack of awareness among guardians regarding nourishing food needed for a child’s growth.The Patel family from Alau cannot be categorised as marginally poor. When Sachin fell ill some six months ago, his parents took him to a neighbouring Indian town to seek treatment. They were, to some extent, taken by surprise when their son was diagnosed with malnutrition. “It’s not that we don’t feed Sachin well,” said Shobha. “We can afford to give him more than two meals a day but we weren’t aware of what is good food for him and what is bad.” A total of 2,680 malnourished children up to 14 years of age have been admitted at the Nutrition Rehabilitation Home in Narayani Hospital since its establishment in 2006. Among them, 1,473 children are from Parsa alone. According to the nutrition home, 820 malnourished children from Bara, 156 from Rautahat, 44 from Sarlahi, seven from Makwanpur, and two each from Chitwan, Dhanusha and Morang have received treatment from the NRH so far. As many as 160 children from various bordering settlements of India have also sought treatment at the NRH.According to Yadav, the nutrition home identifies malnourished children on the basis of the latest standard set by the World Health Organisation. “The height of a newborn should generally be 50cm. The height should increase by 25cm, 12.5cm and 12.5cm in the next three years,” said Yadav. “The children who are brought here for treatment are small for their age which is indicative of malnourishment.” Malnourished children are also prone to various health issues. According to Yadav, a total of 114 children admitted at the NRH have suffered from tuberculosis and 22 others suffered from HIV/AIDS. Health issues like heart ailment, thyroid, meningitis, down syndrome and Thalassemia were also reported among the children admitted at the NRH. Health workers suggest that pregnant women eat nutritious foods during pregnancy to avoid malnutrition in their newborns. “In the course of the treatment, we offer balanced meals of rice, lentils, vegetables, legumes, eggs and meat to the children,” said Yadav. “That is all the parents have to do, feed nutritious food which is easily available.”","Published at : November 21, 2021",Parsa,Shankar Acharya
Dispute among people’s representatives deprives students of textbooks,"More than 4,000 students of several community schools in Chhinnamasta Rural Municipality of Saptari district are yet to get textbooks due to disputes among the people’s representatives regarding budget distribution. Chhinnamasta Rural Municipality did not hold the village council meeting for the fiscal year 2020/21. As per the Intergovernmental Fiscal Arrangement Act-2017, local governments were required to present their fiscal budgets for the fiscal year 2021/22 by June 24 at their village or municipal assemblies. But the local unit kicked off the meeting for this fiscal year only a couple of days ago. The local unit has failed to issue a budget for most headings under the education sector, which has affected the academic structure of all community schools in the rural municipality. “As many as 4,042 students of various community schools should be provided with free textbooks. We are halfway through this academic session and we still haven’t been able to distribute books among the students,” said Rajdev Kumar Khanga, the education unit coordinator of Chhinnamasta Rural Municipality. “The delay in budget release has not only held up book distribution but it has also affected the midday meal programmes in many community schools of the rural municipality.”According to Khanga, there are a total of 5,086 students in 19 community schools of the rural municipality. The federal government distributes textbooks to students up to grade 10 through the local units.The delay in book distribution has affected the academic performance of the students, says Mahendra Prasad Yadav, the headmaster at a primary school in Hati. “Some students have been using old books. But the curriculum for some grades has changed from this academic session. The learning and teaching processes cannot move effectively without books to refer to for students,” said Yadav. According to Yadav, the municipality has not issued a budget under any headlines for the education sector, except for scholarships and miscellaneous expenses. “Even the midday meal programme has been halted. This will lead to a spike in absenteeism among students in community schools,” said Yadav.The human resources appointed by the local unit in various schools are also deprived of monthly salary owing to the rural municipality’s inability to hold its village council meeting. According to Khanga, 148 employees, including teachers, accountants and office assistants, in Chhinnamasta Rural Municipality have not received their salaries for the past four months.“The teachers and other employees appointed by the rural municipality did not get a salary during the Dashain, Tihar and Chhath festivals as well. They visited the rural municipality office time and again and urged the administration to release their salaries but to no avail,” said Yadav.Although the village council meeting for this fiscal year started on Friday, there is no indication of its timely completion since the people’s representatives are still divided on the priority of development projects, says Mahesh Sharma, the acting chief administrative officer of the local unit.The day-to-day administrative works and development activities have also been greatly affected in Chhinnamasta because of the delay in budget release. Health institutions in Chhinnamasta are facing a shortage of medicines due to the lack of budget. “We haven’t been able to purchase medicines. People blame health workers for not giving them medicines but since there is no budget to buy medicines, there’s nothing the health workers can do,” said Sharma. According to Sharma, service seekers haven’t been able to register birth and death events, as the rural municipality does not have official stationery to certify the events on paper. The office does not have the budget to buy new ones. “The office does not even have printer ink and paper. How can we run an office in such a condition?” he said.","Published at : November 16, 2021",Rajbiraj,Abdhesh Kumar Jha
Timber smuggling unchecked in Sarlahi,"The felling and smuggling of timber go unchecked in several forests of Sarlahi, a Tarai district in Province 2.Janakinagar collaborative forest in Hariharpur Municipality-1 has been seeing a rise in tree felling and smuggling cases of late. According to the Division Forest Office in Sarlahi, around 100 sal trees were cut down in the forest in the past few months. “The forest office has tightened security in the forest spreading from Ghurkauli to Janaknagar after we were informed about the tree felling incidents. The smugglers left the felled trees and ran away after we intensified forest patrolling. The forest employees are collecting the logs now,” said Madhav Prasad Dev, the chief at the Division Forest Office.Dev suspects that the residents of various nearby settlements might have been involved in the rampant felling of sal trees. “Preparation is underway to raid nearby settlements in coordination with the local police units. The forest office could not raid the settlements earlier due to the festive season,” said Dev.According to the Division Forest Office, 120 cubic feet of wood has been recovered from Janakinagar collaborative forest so far. “Search for the felled trees is going on. The smugglers mostly cut down trees from the remote parts of the forest,” said Dev.The local people, however, blame the indifference of the forest office and the office bearers of the forest users’ group for the unchecked felling of trees in Janakinagar collaborative forest. “The forest office remained mute spectators for months. They did not run any security patrol in the forest area,” said a resident of Ghurkauli settlement preferring anonymity. “It is not possible to cut down and smuggle trees out of the forest without the support of the forest employees. The smugglers must have colluded with the forest officials and the office bearers of the forest users’ group.”The Sub-division Forest Office in Janakinagar admits that it could not effectively patrol the forest area due to a lack of human resources. “We failed to strengthen security in the forest area because we did not have the required manpower,” said Subas Sah, the assistant forest officer and chief at the office. According to him, his office seized two tractors loaded with illegally felled timber and detained five people in the past three months.Meanwhile, Ram Biswash Raya, chairman of Janakinagar collaborative forest users’ group, claims that the local people cut down green trees on the pretext of collecting dry twigs for firewood. “We are concerned about the rise in smuggling cases. Efforts are underway to identify the smugglers and bring them to book,” said Raya.","Published at : November 15, 2021",Sarlahi,Om Prakash Thakur
Shikaribas residents demand relocation,"Narayan Aryal has spent about seven and a half decades of his life in Shikaribas village. The eldest member of the village does not want to live there anymore. The 82-year-old wants the government to move the villagers to a place with basic amenities.“I have almost spent my whole life in this village in the middle of a forest. I missed out on a lot in life. I don’t want my grandchildren to suffer the same fate as me,” said Aryal. “I want them to live in a safe place that has development infrastructures. I wish the government would relocate our whole settlement outside the forests,” he said. Twenty-one-year-old Rajendra Chaudhary is tired of living a life of poverty, unemployment, scarcity amid the fear of wildlife. “There is nothing in the village. Parsa National Park had relocated Rambhauribhatha, a settlement inside the park forest, to a safer place around 15 years ago. I wish they would do the same for us,” he said. Shikaribas is an old settlement in Ward 3 of Thori Rural Municipality, Parsa district. The village is surrounded by the forests of Parsa and Chitwan national parks. One has to pass a dense forest around seven kilometres wide to reach the village from the Birgunj-Thori section of Postal Highway. People often encounter wild elephants, tigers and bears, among other wild animals, on their commute.The locals of Shikaribas have to live in constant fear of wild animals and the village does not have modern facilities like electricity, drinking water, roads and a health post. Around 250 people of 54 households in the settlement are impatient for relocation.“Nobody wants to stay in a village that does not have basic facilities like electricity, drinking water, roads and health posts. We have been urging the government without launching any movement and protest to shift our settlement. But the authorities concerned have ignored our demand for years,” said Bhuwan Khadka, another local of the settlement.The village has a basic school that runs classes up to grade five only. The school was established in 1979 but it is yet to be upgraded up to the secondary level. The children have to commute 14 kilometres to reach the nearest school in Bijayapur or Ghyangdanda if they want to continue their studies after grade five. And there is the risk of attacks by wild animals while going to and returning from the school outside the settlement.According to the villagers, Shikaribas is a settlement older than Bijayabasti, Subarnapur and Thori. “The other villages have modern infrastructures and facilities but Shikaribas is still in the ‘stone age’,” said Khadka.Of the total 54 households, 52 are Tharu families. According to Rajendra, around 99 percent of the villagers are landless. And the houses are all thatched huts. “The villagers have been using the land for years but they do not have land ownership certificates. They cannot sell the land, nor can they take a loan from the financial institutions by keeping the land as collateral,” he added. There are around 100 bighas of paddy fields registered in the name of landlords outside the village. Almost all the locals in Shikaribas are tenants, tilling the paddy fields of landlords. They get 50 percent of the total harvests. “Around 40 percent of the crops are destroyed by wild animals like elephants, wild boars and deer,” said a local farmer.Until three years ago, the villagers did not have access to safe drinking water and were using water from the local stream. The villages then initiated the construction of an intake in the Amawa Jiurwa stream three years ago and constructed half a dozen drinking water taps. But the tap water is not drinkable during the rainy season as it becomes murky. “And the wild animals, mainly the elephants, damage the supply line time and again,” said Rajendra.Thori Rural Municipality does not have any concrete plan either to shift the village or carry out development activities. The local unit planned to launch a homestay service in Shikaribas two years ago but the programme has been left in limbo due to the Covid-19 pandemic.“We don’t have any specific development projects in Shikaribas,” said the rural municipality’s chief PL Shrestha. He instead said they are coordinating with the provincial and federal governments for relocating the villagers.","Published at : October 21, 2021",Parsa,Shankar Acharya
Province 2 sees rise in drowning incidents,"Two hundred and eighty five cases of death by drowning were reported in eight districts of Province 2 in the past 27 months, according to the data of the Provincial Police Office in Janakpur.The majority of the fatalities in the province were children, the data showed. As many as 72 children under five years of age and 108 children aged five to 18 years drowned in the last 27 months. On June 11, a group of eight children—five girls and three boys—between 10 and 14 years had taken their cattle out for grazing in Mukhiyapatti Musharniya Rural Municipality, Dhanusha. As the temperature rose during the day, the group decided to swim in a newly dug pond to cool themselves. All of them took a plunge together, but only three boys came out alive.The five girls—Lakshiminiya Yadav, 12, Chandrakumari Bhagat, 10, Manju Purbe, 13, Chandani Thakur, 12, and Lalita Sahani, 12—died by drowning.“My granddaughter will never return due to the negligence of the individual who dug the pond up to 10 feet and left it open,” said Ram Lakshyan Yadav, Lakshiminiya’s grandfather.Hulas Yadav, a resident of Mukhiyapatti Musharniya Rural Municipality, had dug the pond for fish keeping. “But the pond was left unused and filled with rainwater. The children were not aware of the depth of the pond and they stepped into it. They got trapped and died,” said Ram Lakshyan.Incidents of drowning in boring pits are a common occurrence in the province. “Though many children lose their lives to drowning every year, such incidents are not taken seriously in Tarai,” said Shekh Adalat, a former police inspector of Rautahat. “It is necessary to make the public aware of how to remain safe from drowning and keep their children away from ponds and water bodies.”According to the data of the Provincial Police Office, 79 cases of death by drowning have been reported in the province since the start of the current fiscal year. “Of these deaths, 52 victims were children,” said Krishna Prasai, superintendent of police, also the spokesperson of the Provincial Police Office in Janakpur.In the last fiscal year, 120 cases of drowning were reported in Province 2.“While constructing roads in the rural areas, the contractors dig pits along the road to elevate the land surface. These pits are filled with rainwater in the monsoon, as the contractors do not bury such pits. Many children drown in such rain-filled pits,” said Shyam Narayan Mishra, an engineer who earlier worked at the Postal Highway Road Project. “It is clearly mentioned in the project agreement that the pits created while constructing roads should be buried by the contractors. But most contractors do not fill up the pits, causing human casualties every year.”As per the data available at the Provincial Police Office, 86 people drowned in rain-filled pits, ponds, streams and rivers in Province 2 in the fiscal year 2019/20. Fifty-seven of the victims were children.Incidents of drowning increased in the last fiscal year 2020/21. As many as 120 people drowned in eight districts of Province 2 last year. According to the Provincial Police Office, 44 victims drowned in ponds, 23 in rain-filled pits and 53 others in rivers and streams.“Most of the drowning incidents occur in the rainy season,” said SP Prasain. “Many children drown in rain-filled pits during the monsoon. The Department of Roads or the local units should either fill such pits or build a fence around them,” said SP Prasain.According to him, the provincial natural disaster management committee and its subordinate units should regularly monitor road-side pits and culverts.Civil society leaders and the general public have repeatedly demanded the provincial government take concrete steps to minimise incidents of drowning in Province 2. “The provincial government has allocated a large chunk of its budget for the beautification of ponds and lakes. Security measures should also be included to minimise drowning incidents while beautifying the water bodies,” said Nabal Kishwor Karna, a resident of Janakpur. “The government should also focus on filling up roadside pits.”According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), drowning is the third leading cause of unintentional injury deaths worldwide, accounting for seven percent of all injury-related deaths. As per the WHO estimates, nearly 236,000 people died by drowning in 2019.","Published at : October 5, 2021",Kathmandu,Ajit Tiwari
Musahar children can’t enrol in schools for lack of birth certificates,"Silto Devi Sadaya Musahar, 19, of Jhutaki in Lahan Municipality-24 has three children—two daughters and a son.Her daughters—five-year-old Aakriti and four-year-old Anu—are of school-going age but they have been unable to get admitted at the local community school since their births were not registered. “I married at 13. Since I am underage, my marriage has also not been registered. With no legal documentation, I haven’t been able to register the births of my children,” she said.This is not an anomaly. Several school-going children from the Musahar community, where child marriage is still in practice, have been left out of the education system for a lack of legal documents such as birth certificates.“Women in our community do not have much of a choice. We get married early to ease our parents’ burden and the cycle continues with our children,” said Silto Devi. “But I don’t want that kind of future for my children. I want them to get an education and live a different life. I am living out my days as a daily wage earner with nothing to my name but I don’t want my children to live like this.” Five-year-old Jyoti Sadaya and her four-year-old sister Manisha from the Musahar settlement in Kataha of Lahan-19 are also out of school since they were denied admission for a lack of birth registration certificates. Their father Salin Sadaya, 21, does not have a citizenship certificate nor is his marriage to his teenage wife registered at the ward office. According to the existing legal provisions, the guardians have to furnish their children’s birth certificates while seeking admission at any school.“Despite legal provisions, child marriage is still rampant in the Musahar community. Illiteracy and a lack of awareness on child marriage are some factors that have given continuity to this malpractice,” said Chandeshwar Sada, the chairman of Nepal National Musahar Association. According to him, the association is carrying out a survey to determine the exact number of children from impoverished communities that are out of the school system. “The government authorities and other stakeholders must consider a way for Musahar children to be included in the school system,” said Sada. “Child marriage is a larger problem that needs to be tackled with efforts towards poverty eradication since poverty is one of the leading causes of child marriage in impoverished communities.” According to the recently amended civil code, the minimum age for marriage in Nepal for both women and men is 20. Although the country abolished child marriage in 1963, the practice is still rampant, especially in the rural areas, even as human rights groups regularly blame the government for failing to take sufficient steps to end the practice.According to Sada, even among the Dalit communities, Musahar and Dom are the most marginalised. “Because most marriages and births in these communities are unregistered, a large number of people are deprived of education, child nutrition allowance, Dalit scholarship, citizenship and social security allowances,” he said.Jibachha Yadav, a teacher at Siraha-based Sagarmatha Secondary School, says a large number of children from the Musahar and Dom communities in the area have not been able to attend school for a lack of birth certificates. “The first step towards eradicating malpractices such as child marriage in impoverished communities is to give them a chance at education. That said, we have had to deny enrollment to many children, mainly from the Musahar community, since they don’t have birth certificates issued by the ward office,” Yadav said. Lahan Municipality said efforts are underway to include those children who are deprived of education for a lack of birth registration certificates to the school system. “We have started collecting data on such children. An alternative will be sought so that all children can have access to education,” said Raj Kumar Sah, the education unit chief of the local unit.According to the National Census 2011, the total population of Musahar people across the nation is 234,490.","Published at : September 25, 2021",Siraha,Bharat Jargha Magar
Swollen Koshi waters erode spurs in Saptari,"Rising floodwaters in the Koshi river have started eroding the spurs, structures meant to protect riverbanks and main embankments by deflecting the currents away from riversides, on the western part of the Saptari district.The increased flow of water in the rain-swollen river has added pressure on the spurs, according to technicians of the Koshi River Project. The spur numbered 9.79 in Banarjhula, Ward 5 of Tilathi Koiladi Rural Municipality has been seeing continuous erosion over the last few days. “Since Thursday, efforts are being made to stop the erosion of the spur by constructing a temporary embankment using sand-filled sacks and bamboo trunks at Banarjhula. If the erosion does not stop, the western embankment will be at risk of being swept away,” said Satish Kumar Singh, chairman of Tilathi Koiladi Rural Municipality.On Thursday evening, a team of officials including Singh and Chief District Officer Jaya Narayan Singh of Saptari had reached the Koshi river to take stock of the situation.“The threat of the river breaching its western embankment and entering the settlements has increased,” said Singh. The Koshi Project should have done a better job protecting the embankments and spurs from erosion. The authorities concerned should have taken steps to ensure preparations were made for the monsoon season. Spurs and embankments are at risk of erosion due to shoddy construction.” According to Singh, every year the authorities start embankment repair work only after the erosion starts. Starting August 18, 2008, Koshi Project worked continuously for ten years until 2018 when the Koshi river damaged its eastern embankment in Sunsari district. Five years ago, a pilot channel was dug in the lower part of the Koshi barrage to direct the river current towards the middle section of the river.“But for the last two years, the flow of the Koshi river has been directed towards the western part of Saptari,” Ashok Singh Thakur, engineer superintendent of Koshi Project told the Post. “That’s why the pressure of water flow in the western part has increased in the last two years.According to the Koshi Project, they have started embankment repair work on the western part. “We have been making efforts to control erosion after spurs started to get damaged because of high water flow,” said Singh.","Published at : September 4, 2021",Rajbiraj,Abdhesh Kumar Jha
Ratu River has inundated around 900 houses in Tilgadh since Thursday night,"Incessant rainfall since Thursday night has increased the ferocity of the Ratu river in Mahottari district leading to inundation and floods in several settlements across the district.As of Friday noon, around 900 houses have been inundated in Tilgadh settlement by floodwaters from the river, according to the District Disaster Management Committee.The settlement in Balwa Municipality-4 is one of the most affected areas by floods every year. The flooded Ratu river inundated 900 houses in Ward No. 4 of Balwal Municipality. Laxman Mandal, a local resident of Balawa, said, “The embankment of the river was in a dilapidated condition. The rain-swollen river breached the embankment and entered the settlement.”Chief District Officer of Mahottari, Tirtha Raj Bhattarai, who is also the Chief of the District Disaster Management Committee, said that security forces have been mobilised to rescue and relocate those at risk in the flooded Tilgadh settlement.“Security personnel from Nepal Police, Armed Police Force and Nepal Army have been actively working towards rescuing and providing relief in flood-hit areas,” said Bhattarai. According to Bhattarai, various outlets are being created to drain off the floodwaters from the settlement to mitigate the risk of further inundation. The floodwaters from the Ratu river has also started seeping into the paddy fields near the river at Bardibas-3.According to Dormani Poudel, a local farmer, he has lost 10 katthas of his paddy fields to erosion since yesterday. Bhattarai has urged the locals to stay alert and move to safety as the river is also expected to inundate Jaleswar and other parts of the district if the rains continue.The Ratu river has been causing damage to many settlements in Jaleswar, Balwa, Bardibas, Orahi and other municipalities of the district every year.","Published at : August 27, 2021",Mahottari,Sunita Baral
Bardibas residents protest against railway land compensation rate,"The landowners in Bardibas whose property falls along the proposed Jayanagar-Bardibas Railway and East-West Railway projects staged a protest in the district on Saturday, saying the compensation rate fixed by a government panel was unfair.The concerned landowners said the valuation of their land made by the Land Compensation Fixation Committee was much lower against their current market value.On August 18, the committee had fixed the land compensation rate of 59 bighas of land in Bardibas, the proposed site for the construction of the railway projects. It had decided to provide a minimum of Rs 700,000 to a maximum of Rs 8.1 million for a kattha of land from the eastern part of Ratu stream to the western part of Bhapsi stream as compensation. The committee on Friday also issued a public notice for the distribution of the compensation amount in accordance with the proposed rate.However, the landowners have not agreed to provide their lands at the proposed rate. The struggle committee has warned the Department of Railway not to work on their land plots until the compensation amount is increased. “Even though the landowners cannot get the market price for their land, they should get a minimum of Rs 2 million to a maximum of Rs 12 million per kattha,” said Raju Khadka, coordinator of the Land Compensation Struggle Committee.According to local residents, around 40 families in Bardibas will be displaced after the construction work of the railway project begins. “We have to move to another location once construction works begin. But the government is not willing to provide us with an appropriate land compensation amount. We cannot even purchase a land plot from the rate fixed by the committee.”Though the land owners have been protesting over the issue of compensation rate for a long time, some people say they are happy with the committee’s decision, as the long-standing issue of compensation has been concluded.The construction work of the Jayanagar-Janakpur-Bardibas Railway has been on halt, as the land compensation issue was left undecided for the past seven years. Similarly, works on the East-West Railway have also been disrupted in the Bardibas section for years due to the compensation dispute. The railway project office had decided to acquire the land some seven years ago but the project had been on halt, as the compensation rate could not be determined for a long time.“We can now move forward with the project,” said Poshan Thapa of Bardibas Municipality-1. The authorities are all set to distribute the compensation amount for land acquisition. Chief District Officer of Mahottari Tirtha Raj Bhattarai, who is also the chief of the compensation determination committee, said that the distribution process will start within a month.“We will start distributing the compensation amount by the third week of September,” Bhattarai said. “The protesting locals can file a complaint to the home secretary if their demands are genuine. I am only implementing the government's decision.”According to him, the decision will be implemented unless the district administration office receives the directives from the federal Ministry of Physical Infrastructure to review the valuation of the land acquired for the railway project.The compensation determination committee has divided the acquired land of Bardibas into 32 parts. The government has to distribute Rs 2.3 billion in compensation to around 100 land owners.","Published at : August 22, 2021",Mahottari,Sunita Baral
Floodwaters from Saptakoshi enters Gobargada settlement in Saptari,"At least two houses were swept away by floods from the Saptakoshi river at Gobargada of Hanumannagar Kankalini Municipality on Thursday.According to the locals, flood waters began entering the old Gobargada settlement last evening inundating 35 houses.“The flood-affected locals are currently taking shelter at a local school,” said Shailesh Kumar Sah, mayor of Hanumannagar Kankalini Municipality. Houses in the settlement have been submerged in around two feet of water.""The houses of locals Hari Yadav and Shatrughan Yadav were swept away by the Thursday evening flood while other houses in the area are also at risk of erosion and flooding,"" said Sah. Every year during the monsoon season, the locals live with the risk of inundation and floods since the settlement is in close proximity to the Saptakoshi river in Saptari district.Even though the municipality has been introducing plans to relocate the locals from the area to a safer place every year, the locals have refused to migrate elsewhere. Sah informed that a team under the local ward chairman is taking stock of the damage caused by the flood. “We are trying to make necessary arrangements for the flood-affected locals,” said Sah.","Published at : August 20, 2021",Rajbiraj,Abdhesh Kumar Jha
More than 800 homes under People’s Housing Programme still incomplete,"Jhagaru Musahar of the Musahar settlement in Dumariya, Rautahat, had happily dismantled his thatched-roof house some 10 months ago after the government authorities assured him to make a concrete house under the People’s Housing Programme.The house construction began and he was told it would be completed by mid-March. It’s been five months past the promised deadline, and his new home is nowhere near complete. “We were assured that our new house would be completed by mid-March. But the roof of the house is yet to be built,” said Jhagaru. He has fixed a tarpaulin sheet above his under-construction house, where he lives with his seven-member family.The situation of 49 households in the Musahar settlement in Chandrapur Municipality is the same. The impoverished Musahar people have been left in a lurch as the homes promised to them by the housing programme remain incomplete.The construction of 850 houses began in Rautahat last fiscal year to provide homes to the extremely poor and the impoverished Dalit families in the district. Not a single house has been completed till date.This delay has affected around 5,000 people, most of whom are now taking shelter under flimsy tents and huts. Urban Development and Building Construction Office in Birgunj, a government authority responsible for carrying out the People’s Housing Programme, says that it could not complete the house construction owing to the lack of funds.Birendra Sah, an engineer at the Urban Development and Building Construction Office in Birgunj admits that the poor people have been left high and dry as the houses could not be completed in time. “The roofs in the houses could not be installed due to the lack of funds. Other works were completed by March. We sympathise with the hardships faced by the poor families but we can do nothing,” said Sah.Province 2 government had issued Rs150 million for the People’s Housing Programme in the last fiscal year of 2020/21. Sah said the budget was not enough to complete the houses. “Our repeated requests to the government to release additional funds were not addressed in time,” said Sah. The provincial government has recently issued a Rs180 million for the housing programme, but the Urban Development and Building Construction Office has not yet received go-ahead to mobilise the amount. Sah said it would take three to four months for all 850 houses to complete.The government has a plan to construct 1,973 houses in different places of Rautahat under the People’s Housing Programme. According to the Urban Development and Building Construction Office, the provincial government provides Rs 336,000 to construct a two-room house under the People’s Housing Programme. But the office says it costs around Rs 373,000 to build one house. As per the government regulation, the budget is released in three tranches by forming a consumers’ committee of beneficiaries. The People’s Housing Programme was launched in the district five years ago to provide housing facilities to the poor and marginalised people. Each family would get a house with a kitchen, two rooms and a toilet under the programme. The beneficiaries are required to donate labour worth at least 10 percent of the total cost of the house.But the house construction under the project has faced delays after delays due to funds shortage. “The construction of the houses has been affected as the government does not issue the required funds in time. The poor people have been greatly affected. The government should be careful about the issue,” said Babulal Sah, the provincial assembly member and coordinator of the People’s Housing Programme.","Published at : August 20, 2021",Rautahat,Shiva Puri

Bardibas snakebite centre does not have a ventilator,"Manish Sunar from Gauridanda in Bardibas Municipality-3, Mahottari, was bitten by a snake three weeks ago. The 16-year-old was immediately rushed to the snakebite treatment centre at Bardibas-3 but his treatment was not possible there, as the centre did not have a ventilator.The centre then referred Sunar to Janakpur for treatment. He died on the way.“Sunar’s condition was very critical. We referred him to Janakpur as we could not treat him here without a ventilator,” said Padam Gurung, a technician at the snakebite treatment centre in Bardibas. The centre does not have a single ventilator. In the absence of a ventilator facility, the centre has to refer critical patients to other health institutions for treatment.“Many snakebite patients visiting the centre return home after treatment. But some patients in critical condition need to be referred to other institutions, as we don’t have a ventilator. Such patients may die on their way to a hospital,” said Gurung. Victims of snakebite should be taken to treatment centres at the earliest, Gurung added.Snakebite incidents are reported in several Tarai districts and some hill districts of the country every year. According to estimates, hospitals in the southern plains see up to 20 snakebite patients a day in the monsoon, as parts of the region get flooded by rains. Many snakebite patients from various settlements in Sarlahi, Dhanusha, Sindhuli and Ramechhap districts visit the Bardibas-based centre for treatment. According to Gurung, 10 to 15 snakebite patients visit the eight-bed centre for treatment every day.“Normally, up to 21 vials of anti-snake venom serum is needed for each snakebite victim. But in the summer, more vials are needed, as venomous snakes come out of the ground to escape the heat,” Gurung said. Technicians at the treatment centre underscore the importance of ventilators for the treatment of critical snakebite patients. However, chief of the centre Krishna Prasad Devkota says the health institution has been unable to set up a ventilator facility despite repeated requests to the government authorities and social organisations.“We need additional human resources and funds to run a ventilator facility which is why we are requesting donors to help us,” said Devkota.Nepal is home to around 17 highly venomous snakes. Each year, the country sees about 20,000 to 40,000 cases of snakebite. The numbers could be higher, as many cases of snakebite go unreported, health workers say.According to the record of the snakebite centre in Bardibas, it reported an increase in the number of snakebite victims in the fiscal year 2020-2021. “Three-hundred and seven snakebite victims received treatment from the centre in the fiscal year 2020-21,” said Devkota. The World Health Organisation estimates that around 5.4 million snakebite incidents occur globally each year, resulting in up to 2.7 million cases of envenoming. It also estimates that up to 137,880 deaths and three times as many amputations, and other disabilities, occur each year due to snakebites.","Published at : August 7, 2021",Bardibas (mahottari),Sunita Baral
"Viral fever cases up in Province 2, say health workers","All eight districts of Province 2 have reported a rise in cases of fever, headache and the common cold, health workers say. Health institutions across the province are seeing a daily increase in patients with Covid-19-like symptoms and viral fever since mid-July.Around 150 residents of Maitagadhi Village in Rajbiraj Municipality-10, Saptari are suffering from fever, common cold and body ache, among other symptoms, for the last three to four days. Local authorities have started sending health workers to villages to treat patients and gauge the situation.“We have organised a health camp in the village from Friday. A team of health workers are currently in the village to treat patients,” said Shambhu Prasad Yadav, mayor of Rajbiraj Municipality.Other parts of the district are also reporting a surge in fever patients, according to the District Health Office in Saptari. “At least one member of each family is suffering from fever, common cold and body pain, among other health issues, in Saptari. We are seeing a huge surge in the number of fever patients, mostly in the rural parts of the district,” said Duniyalal Yadav, chief at the health office.Despite the increase in the number of patients with coronavirus-like symptoms, the local authorities and health institutions in the district are yet to initiate Covid-19 testing in the villages.“The resurgence of coronavirus is imminent if we look at the increase in the number of patients with symptoms similar to that of the virus. Patients are found suffering from fever, common cold and body pain, among other health issues. We can rule out Covid-19 infection only after conducting tests,” said Dr Ranjit Kumar Jha, medical superintendent at Gajendra Narayan Singh Hospital in Rajbiraj.But the hospital has yet to test the patients for coronavirus. “We haven’t been able to conduct PCR tests because the only PCR machine at the hospital is out of order,” Jha said. Health workers at Kalaiya Hospital in Bara say they have been flooded with fever cases for the last few weeks. The flow of patients has increased in both government and private health institutions, health workers say. According to the doctors of Kalaiya Hospital, cases of typhoid and viral fever are also being reported from various villages these days. “Kalaiya Hospital has been receiving 150 to 200 patients on a daily basis. Among them, almost half are patients of viral fever,” said Gaurav Mahato, acting medical superintendent of Kalaiya Hospital.Children, women and senior citizens are the most affected, local residents say.According to the data of the hospital, five out of 53 swab samples tested positive for Covid-19 in Kalaiya Hospital in the last three days. “The patients were advised to stay in home isolation, as they were not in need of hospitalisation,” said Mahato.The District Hospital in Malangawa and other health institutions in Sarlahi are also receiving a surging number of patients with fever and the common cold. Dr Nawal Kishor Jha, acting medical superintendent of the hospital, says the summer season has seen an increase in patients with viral fever.“Five percent of the total collected swab samples test positive for coronavirus on a daily basis,” said Jha. “The rest of the patients are suffering from viral fever, which is a seasonal disease. But we should not be complacent. The risk of coronavirus infection is still high.” Viral fever cases have also increased in Dhanusha district since last week.Binod Bhandari, a resident of Sita Chowk in Janakpur, and his wife had been suffering from a high fever for the past few days. Upon visiting the hospital, the couple were told that they were suffering from viral fever.“My wife and I were suffering from fever and cold. We took paracetamol, but our temperature did not lower, so we visited a hospital,” Bhandari said. “Doctors at Janakpur Hospital told us that we are suffering from viral fever.”Similarly, Narayani Hospital in Parsa is receiving 25 to 30 patients with “Influenza A” fever on a daily basis. According to doctors at the hospital, most of the patients have a fever, loss of appetite and body pain, among other health issues. “Patients between 20 and 60 years are found suffering from Influenza A. We are only conducting PCR tests on coronavirus suspects,” said Dr Uday Narayan Singh, chief at the Emergency Department of the hospital. One-and-a-half weeks ago, five swab samples were sent to Teku Laboratory in Kathmandu for verification. “The lab report verified the disease as Influenza A,” said Singh.According to the data of the Ministry of Social Development in Province 2, there are currently 442 active Covid-19 cases in the province.

Security personnel were deployed in the area after the floods started eroding the embankment on Monday night.“Security personnel on Tuesday attempted to protect the embankment by piling up soil-filled sacs along the river. But the floods swept them away and damaged the embankment,” said Superintendent of Police Prakash Ranabhat.

Around 70 such spurs should be constructed in the area to control the floods,” said Ekaraj Bhattarai, chief at the project office. “Repair works of the breached embankment have started from Wednesday with the support of security personnel and the local people.”Minister of Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation Pampha Bhusal released a Rs 5 million budget on Tuesday to control the flood in the Kamala river.The breach of embankment by the Kamala river has put several settlements of Sabaila, Shahidnagar and Kamala municipalities and Janaknandi Rural Municipality in the eastern part of Dhanusha district at high risk of floods and inundation.","Published at : July 22, 2021",Dhanusha,Santosh Singh
Badaharwa residents living in tents after their homes were inundated,"Sakuntala Devi has been living in a flimsy tent pitched on the road after the flooded Jhaj river inundated her house at Badaharwa settlement in Durgabhagawati Rural Municipality-5, Rautahat on Saturday. The 67-year-old does not know how long her six-member family should languish in such a pitiable condition.“Living under tents during the rainy season is not easy.

The families had sought shelter on the same spot two years ago when their settlement was flooded.Chief Minister of Province 2 Lalbabu Raut, along with some federal and provincial ministers, had reached Badaharwa in 2019 and met with the flood-affected people. The local people had requested the authorities to relocate them to a safer location. “The chief minister and ministers had promised to move us elsewhere. But the process has not begun yet,” said Ganesh Sah, a local resident. The Bagmati, Lalbakaiya and Jhaj, among other rivers and streams, in Rautahat are flooded as it has been raining unabated in the Chure region for the past few days. According to the District Natural Disaster Management Centre, more than 200 families have been displaced across the district due to monsoon-related disasters. According to Yadav, several settlements in wards 1, 2, 3 and 9 of Ishanath Municipality, Ward No 9 of Rajdevi Municipality and wards 5, 7 and 8 of Durga Bhagawati Rural Municipality have been affected by floods.A few days ago, the flooded Bagmati damaged a bridge and eroded its embankment at Singarman in Gadhimai Municipality-9. The river has also started eroding embankments at wards 1 and 2 of Rajdevi Municipality. According to the District Administration Office, security personnel from the Nepal Army, Nepal Police and Armed Police Force have been mobilised to repair the damaged embankments. Police posts and government offices in Rautahat have also been inundated.“The police posts at Basantpur, Mahadevpatti and the customs post along the Nepal-India border have been moved elsewhere due to inundation,” said Superintendent of Police Siddhi Bikram Shah.","Published at : July 5, 2021",Rautahat,Shiva Puri

"Annual budget, policies presented amid protests in several local units of Province 2","Tensions ran high in the municipal and village council meetings of several local units of Province 2 while presenting the budget and policy and programme on Thursday.A violent clash ensued in Maulapur Municipality of Rautahat district on Thursday as the political parties staged demonstrations. Security personnel lobbed two dozen tear gas canisters to contain the situation and prevent any untoward incidents. Some security personnel and protesters were injured as rival political parties hurled stones at one another, said police.“The situation is under control now,” said Indradev Yadav, the chief district officer of Rautahat.The clash erupted between the supporters of Mayor Rina Devi Sah and some ward chiefs who are backed by Nepali Congress, CPN (Maoist Centre), Upendra Yadav faction of Janata Samajbadi Party and Nepal group of CPN (UML). The disgruntled group of ward chiefs staged demonstrations soon after the municipal council started where former minister Prabhu Sah was the chief guest.“We were forced to protest as the mayor unilaterally decided to hold a municipal council when it’s the executive body of the municipality who should schedule the council meeting,” said Ram Prabesh Yadav, the protesting ward chairman of Maulapur-1. The agitating people’s representatives and the party activists said the mayor and her supporters misused their power.However, Mayor Sah claimed that the municipal council was scheduled after fulfilling the due process. “The anti-development forces are protesting the council,” she said.The municipal council meeting continued despite protests outside the meeting hall. A large number of Nepal Police personnel were deployed in the area to contain the situation.According to the Local Government Operation Act 2017, the local units should hold council meetings each year by the 10th Nepali month of Asadh (which falls on June 24 this year).Various local bodies, including Maulapur, Katahariya, Gujara, Ishanath, Phatuwa Bijayapur and Yamunamai, in Rautahat commenced their council meetings amid protests this year. The office of Rajdevi Municipality said it completed its municipal council meeting on June 21 despite disputes among its members. Deputy Mayor of the municipality Ansu Singh boycotted the meeting. The council meetings of Kalaiya and Jitpur Simara Sub Metropolis and Debahi Gonahi, Garuda, Brindaban and Baudhimai municipalities are yet to begin owing to disputes among the stakeholders. In Janakpurdham Sub Metropolitan City, most of the municipal members chanted slogans in the assembly on Thursday demanding budget transparency. They also demanded that plans and projects for the wards be made public. Janakpurdham Sub Metropolis made public a budget of around Rs 1.47 billion for the next fiscal year amid protests and demonstrations. In Sabaila Municipality of Dhanusha, a group of local youths demanded the authorities make public the expenditures of the current fiscal year in the municipal council. Security personnel were deployed to prevent the protesters from entering the assembly hall. In Mithila Municipality of Dhanusha, Dhalkebar residents chanted slogans against Mayor Harinayaran Mahato at the municipal assembly, accusing him of trying to shift the location of the Trauma Centre in Dhalkebar to Lalgadh for his benefit. In Mahottari, supporters of various political parties padlocked the office of Matihani Municipality, demanding that the expenditures of the current fiscal year be made public. The municipal assembly continued despite the protests.According to the Provincial Police Office in Janakpur, security personnel were deployed in all 135 local units of the province on Thursday, keeping in view possible clashes and demonstrations during village and municipal assemblies.","Published at : June 24, 2021",Rautahat,Ajit Tiwari						 &
Saptari stares at flooding season with no concrete plans,"Each year, hundreds of people from various settlements in Saptari are greatly affected by floods in the Khando River. Last week, Khando River Management Project in Saptari—a government agency responsible for controlling floods and carrying out flood emergency preparedness—said it will not be able to execute any flood control, emergency relief and rescue work to save people’s lives and properties this monsoon season for a lack of budget. This decision has left many local residents worried about possible floods and landslides.Satya Narayan Yadav of Tilathi Koiladi-8 says every year during monsoon, his settlement gets inundated by the flood in the Khando River. “But in the past, there would be some level of preparation from the authorities to mitigate such disasters,” he said. “This year, the project office says it can do nothing in case of floods. This is sheer negligence.” Rewakanta Yadav, the chief at the project office, wrote to the local units in Saptari district on Sunday, informing them that the project will be unable to carry out any emergency flood control work this year due to budget shortage. The project office has urged the local units to take the necessary measures to deal with water-induced disasters themselves. “We are unable to carry out emergency control work until we receive a budget for the same,” reads the letter dispatched to the local bodies.According to Yadav, the federal government has not issued a budget under emergency river control in the current fiscal year.The Meteorological Forecasting Division predicts more rainfall and a longer rainy season this year. But the authorities in Saptari, one of the highly flood-prone districts in Province 2, are not prepared to control the floods and inundation and protect people's lives and properties. Chief District Officer of Saptari Phanindramani Pokharel admits the authorities’ failure to do substantial work to control rivers and streams during the rainy season. “The early warning system is weak. The authorities have failed to take measures to prepare for disasters,” said Pokharel during a virtual meeting of the concerned authorities and stakeholders on Friday.Hundreds of people, if not thousands, are affected by the floods in several rivers and streams in Saptari district every year. The floods in the Koshi, Triyuga, Khando, Mahuli, Sundari, Balan, Kajara, Mutani, Ghodadah and Jita, among other rivers and streams, enter the settlements and damage crops planted in hundreds of hectares of land.According to Yadav, most of the places in Saptari are prone to floods and inundation in the absence of a proper embankment along the rivers and a lack of water outlets. “Although flooding is a recurring problem, we haven’t been able to initiate sustainable measures to resolve it due to budget shortage,” he said.Satish Kumar Singh, the chairman of Tilathi Koiladi Rural Municipality, is critical of the project office’s remark. “The project office cannot shy away from its duty and responsibility. The office was established to control the Khando River and to mitigate flood-related disasters caused by the river,” said Singh. “The rural municipality is also working for flood control but we won’t be able to do it alone.” All eight districts of Province 2 are at risk of floods and inundation. However, the preparedness to control the disaster and protect people’s lives and properties is lacking.In Dhanusha, several settlements are affected by floods and inundation every year. The floods in the Kamala and Aurahi rivers enter the settlements and cause massive damages. But the district administration does not have a concrete disaster preparedness plan, except directing the local units to take the necessary measures to control floods and manage emergency relief and rescue work.“We have asked the local governments to be prepared for emergency works and manage rescue materials and reliefs. The security agencies have been kept on high alert,” said Chief District Officer Bandu Prasad Bastola.Meanwhile, Nepal Police personnel conducted a flood emergency rescue drill in Gangasagar pond in Janakpur on Monday.

Repair works of damaged embankments at final stage,"The residents of several settlements along the Bagmati and Lalbakaiya rivers in Rautahat district are hopeful to avert possible floods and inundation this year, as the authorities have intensified repair works of the damaged embankments. Floods in the Bagmati and Lalbakaiya rivers had breached the embankments and inundated several settlements in Rautahat last year.“Work is underway along the Bagmati and Lalbakaiya rivers to prevent floods from entering the settlements. The flood-damaged embankment is being repaired at 28 places along the river,” said Chief District Officer Indra Dev Yadav. He claimed that the repair works would be completed within a few days.The repair work of the embankment is near completion at 12 different places along the Bagmati river and 16 different places along the Lalbakaiya river. The Bagmati-Lalbakaiya River Control Project Office in Parwanipur, with the initiation of the Home Ministry, has carried out the repair works.The embankments along the flood-prone Bagmati and Lalbakaiya rivers were constructed in 1989 with the support of the Indian government. During last year’s flood, the Bagmati and Lalbakaiya rivers had breached the embankments at 29 different places. The flooded Bagmati river inundated several settlements in Gaur and Rajadevi municipalities and Durgabhagawati Rural Municipality. Similarly, the flooded Lalbakaiya river had wreaked havoc in Ishanath Municipality and various other villages in the northern part of the district.According to the District Natural Disaster Management Committee, several settlements in Rautahat are at high risk of floods and water-induced disasters every year. The embankment along the Lalbakaiya river had suffered damages during last year’s flood in Tikuliya, which lies near the Nepal-India border. The embankment’s repair works were halted by the Indian side, putting nearby settlements at high risk of flooding and inundation. “But the damaged embankment at Tikuliya has been repaired this year at the initiative of the district administration office,” said Allak Siddiki, chief at the Bagmati-Lalbakaiya River Control Project Office. “The repair work is at its final stage. The local residents are relieved now with the repair and maintenance works nearing completion.”“We are very relieved that the embankments are being repaired before the monsoon sets in. We are hopeful that the floods in the Bagmati and Lalbakaiya rivers won’t inundate our settlements this year onwards,” said Suraj Sah, a resident of Chandiya in Rautahat. The Bagmati-Lalbakaiya River Control Project Office started the repair works in April this year. A team of stakeholders led by CDO Yadav visited the embankment repair sites on Friday and monitored the work progress. “Works are going in full swing, as the meteorological office has forecasted an early monsoon with more than average rainfall this year. The repair works are at its final stage. We hope that it will help protect several settlements from floods and landslides in the district,” said Yadav.However, The Bagmati-Lalbakaiya River Control Project Office says the federal government has yet to release the funds needed to complete the repair works.","Published at : June 14, 2021",Rautahat,Shiva Puri
Police officer is caught in film assaulting civilian in Birgunj,"Parsa district police has come under fire after one of its officers was caught in a film assaulting a civilian.Deputy Superintendent of Police Prahlad Karki assaulted Afroz Ahamad, an employee at a surgical supplies store, in Birgunj on Wednesday. The officer’s action was caught in a CCTV camera installed at the store. The footage and stills showing Karki hitting and kicking Ahamad were shared on various social media platforms, drawing widespread condemnation. Karan Patel, the store owner and Ahamad’s employer, accused Karki and his fellow officers of assaulting a general store owner before storming into his shop and beating up Ahamad. “Karki’s team manhandled the owner of the general store and forced him to close his shop saying the prohibitory hours had started,” Patel told the Post. Prohibitory orders have been imposed in Birgunj to control Covid-19 and the shops selling daily essentials are only allowed to open in the morning up to 8am. The general store was open when a police patrol led by Karki arrived there at around 10:21am. Patel said Karki assaulted Ahamad alleging that he had filmed the officers abusing the general store owner. “He [Karki] came to our store and started kicking and hitting Ahamad with a baton. He also snatched Ahamad’s mobile,” Patel added. “Ahamad was on a video call with his friend and the police thought that he was filming them.”Ahamad, who sustained minor injuries in the incident, is currently resting at his home. The Surgical and Chemical Association of Nepal has demanded action against Karki. The association submitted a memorandum of demand to the chief district officer of Parsa on Thursday. Superintendent of Police Bel Bahadur Pandey said it was wrong for an officer of the law to assault civilians.“Some people took videos of security personnel enforcing the lockdown. But beating someone for taking a video is not right,” he said. Province 2 Police Office has formed a three-member team led by Superintendent of Police Krishna Prasai to investigate the incident. “Legal action will be taken against the officers who are found guilty,” said Deputy Inspector General of Police Dhiraj Pratap Singh.","Published at : May 28, 2021",Birgunj,Bhusan Yadav
No contact tracing in Province 2 due to lack of medical equipment,"Jagarnathpur Rural Municipality, in coordination with the district administration office in Parsa, started Covid-19 testing in the rural municipality four days ago after scores of villagers were taken ill in the rural municipality in the span of 10 days.At least 16 people have died due to Covid-19 complications since May 3 in the rural municipality.At Chiljhapati village in the rural municipality, where the tests were carried out, seven out of 11 people tested positive for the virus during antigen tests while swab samples of 17 out of 25 people taken for Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction test came positive for Covid-19. According to data collected by the joint team of health workers dispatched from Birgunj and officials from the local unit, 173 people are suffering from fever at Chiljhapati village alone. According to the rural municipality’s health unit, seven of the 16 deceased had tested positive for coronavirus. Nine positive cases were from Chiljhapati. Contact tracing of those who came in contact with 24 people who had tested positive following antigen and PCR tests on Tuesday had not taken place until Sunday.“We are now sure that the virus has spread across the rural municipality,” said Pravendra Prasad Sah, the health unit chief of the rural municipality.Sah said there is a shortage of antigen and virus transport medium kits limiting the number of tests that can be conducted but the rural municipality does not have the financial resources to procure them. “We have already informed the higher authorities to provide us with antigen and VTM kits but we have not received them,” said Sah. Jaymod Thakur, health inspector at the Health Office in Prasa district, informed that Rs1 million had been allocated for every rural municipality for their fight against Covid-19. “The rural municipalities should procure the necessary medical equipment from the allocated money and conduct tests in areas where the virus has spread using their own health workers,” said Thakur. “If the allotted fund is not enough, they can use their own resources. They will be compensated later,” said Thakur.Pitambar Ghimire, the Chief District Officer of Parsa, admitted that the authorities have not been able to conduct tests in the affected rural municipality for the lack of testing kits. “There are no Covid testing kits to conduct testing in Jagarnathpur,” said Ghimire, adding that his office has issued a directive to transfer seriously ill patients to Birgunj for further treatment. “The rural municipality will procure the antigen and VTM kits on its own. Testing will begin within 2-3 days,” Sandip Patel, acting chief administrative officer of the rural municipality told the Post.Ghimire further said that police have been informed to control the movement of people at the rural municipality. The rural municipality has set up a 25-bed isolation unit in Hotel Baba in Birgunj. However, the villagers are reluctant to go there. “The hotel isolation centre is empty and people are roaming around the village without any restriction as they don’t want to go into isolation,” said Sah.","Published at : May 16, 2021",Birgunj,Bhusan Yadav
11 Covid-19 suspects died in a rural municipality in 10 days,"The health authority, in coordination with the district administration office in Parsa, has started Covid-19 testing after 11 people died and scores of villagers were taken ill in Jagarnathpur Rural Municipality in the past 10 days.A joint team of health workers dispatched from Birgunj and officials from the local unit visited the affected settlements and checked on the patients’ health situation on Tuesday and Wednesday.According to Pravendra Prasad Sah, the health unit chief of Jagarnathpur Rural Municipality, health workers collected the swabs of 25 corona suspects and conducted antigen tests of 11 other patients in Jagarnathpur-5. “Seven out of 11 fever patients who underwent antigen tests tested positive for Covid-19. The swabs have been sent to Narayani Hospital in Birgunj for Polymerase Chain Reaction test,” said Sah. The results of the PCR tests are yet to arrive.The health unit of Jagarnathpur Rural Municipality wrote to the District Administration Office, District Health Office and Narayani Hospital on Monday, urging them to dispatch a health team of medical specialists after scores of villagers were down with coronavirus-like symptoms. “As many as 173 people have been suffering from fever at Chiljhapati settlement,” Sah said. Most of the villagers were reluctant to get tested for fear of being taken to an isolation ward in Birgunj. “Some of the patients fled to the fields and refused health check-ups. We convinced them to return home and get themselves tested,” Sah told the Post over the phone. According to him, health workers have distributed medicines to the patients.In Jagarnathpur, 11 people have died of Covid-19 complications in recent months. A 35-year-old Covid-19 infected man from Jagarnathpur-1 died in the course of treatment at Narayani Hospital on Tuesday morning. According to Dr Saroj Roshan Das, the coordinator at the Covid-19 ward in Narayani Hospital, the deceased man was admitted to the hospital on May 4. “The man had no other ailments but was suffering from severe pneumonia caused by Covid-19,” said Das.According to the rural municipal office, seven of the 11 deceased were from the same settlement and four of them had undergone PCR tests.The local people of the municipality are now demanding mass testing but the authorities are yet to address their demands.“The local unit has yet to conduct a mass testing of coronavirus suspects. People here still don’t know much about the coronavirus since the local body did not run any awareness campaigns,” said Shrikanta Yadav of Jagarnathpur-3. “Since there is widespread ignorance regarding the pandemic, the infected are deprived of treatment and medicines.”Similarly, scores of people have been suffering from fever in Badhnihar and other surrounding settlements in Parsagadhi Municipality. Senior health officials are concerned, as the fever patients are taking antibiotics from the local clinics under the impression that they are suffering from typhoid.Buddhi Raj Paudel of Badhnihar in Parsagadhi suffered from a fever last week. He took paracetamol for three days but the medicine had no effect. He went to a local private clinic and did a blood test. “I am taking antibiotics after the blood test confirmed I had typhoid,” said Paudel, who is also a local trader. “There is hardly any house in Badhnihar and its vicinity who are not suffering from fever.”Health workers, however, are concerned that the local people might have contracted Covid-19 and not typhoid. “Many people in Badhnihar and other settlements are suffering from fever and cough. Typhoid, a waterborne disease, does not spread in such a way. We suggested local health workers provide medicines and follow the health security protocols of coronavirus disease,” said Chandra Bhusan Singh, the medical officer at Bageshwori Health Post in Parsagadhi-6.According to Ramu Sharma, a local resident of Badhnihar, three villagers have died of Covid-19 since April this year and five others are in ventilators now. “The villagers suffering from fever for the past few days think they have typhoid. But it is not clear whether they are merely suffering from typhoid or have contracted Covid-19. The authorities concerned are yet to conduct tests for Covid-19 in the area,” said Sharma. Kameshwor Chaurasiya, chief at the District Health Office, did not want to comment on the health situation of Jagarnathpur and other settlements despite repeated requests.","Published at : May 13, 2021",Birgunj,Bhusan Yadav
Delayed PCR test reports risk coronavirus transmission in Sarlahi district,"A 55-year-old man from Malangwa Municipality Ward No. 8, the district headquarters of Sarlahi, took medicines for seasonal flu after suffering from high fever and common cold. But even after several days of taking medicines, he was not feeling well. So he went to the District Hospital in Sarlahi to get his swab tested for Covid-19. It took three days for his results to arrive. He tested positive for Covid-19. “I stayed with my family at the same house. Now my family might also have contracted the virus. No contact tracing has been conducted here,” he said. “Some of my family members have also complained of throat irritation. I would have isolated myself had I gotten the results earlier.”On Thursday, Godaita Municipality in Sarlahi collected 32 swab samples but the reports of only 12 samples have arrived so far. Ten of them tested positive for Covid-19.“We are facing difficulties to manage Covid-19 suspects due to delay in receiving test reports. This has increased the risk of Covid-19 transmission,” said Devendra Yadav, mayor of the municipality. “Those who were in contact with the suspects can easily transmit the virus to others while waiting for the test results to be released. This is why it is necessary to perform PCR tests and release reports soon.” Sarlahi has 260 active cases at present with four fatalities, according to the data of the District Health Office.The District Hospital in Sarlahi has a PCR laboratory in operation. “The lab can test 94 swab samples at once. The testing becomes expensive if we test just a few samples at a time. This is why we conduct testing only after having collected 94 samples, which takes a few days,” said Shree Prasad Sah, senior public health inspector at the hospital.According to him, 390 swab samples have been collected in the district for PCR testing within the last three days. “PCR testing has also been affected due to frequent power cuts. This is why we are unable to release test reports on time,” said Sah. Until now, the District Hospital has collected 390 swab samples after it started PCR testing from its own lab from April 29. Out of 244 swab samples tested, 85 tested positive for Covid-19, the hospital data showed. Meanwhile, Kailali is also facing a delay in obtaining PCR test reports, as the collected swab samples from the district are being sent to Dhangadhi for testing, health workers say.“We have to keep patients under observation until the PCR test reports arrive from Dhangadhi. Usually, patients showing symptoms of fever, headache and common cold are suspected of having Covid-19. If test reports are released soon, treatment can be done accordingly,” said Dr Ramesh Upadhyay of Tikapur Hospital.The majority of Covid-19 suspected individuals have been provided with supplemental oxygen at the hospital. “The flow of patients is increasing now and it’s already beyond the hospital's capacity. If this situation continues, the hospital cannot handle any more patients,” said Upadhyay.According to doctors, it takes at least five days to receive PCR test reports after swab collection. “We collect swabs twice a week and send them to Dhangadhi for lab tests. The hospital receives PCR reports after several days,” Upadhyay said. In the last few weeks, the hospital has collected 407 swab samples. Among them, the hospital received only 285 test results, 88 of them positive, as per the data of the hospital. So far, nine people have died of Covid-19 in Tikapur alone, according to the data of the District Health Office in Kailali.Ganesh Chaudhary in Tikapur contributed reporting.","Published at : May 10, 2021",Sarlahi,Om Prakash Thakur
Covid-19 hospital in Janakpur caught off guard by second wave,"On Wednesday noon, a Covid-19 patient from Matihani in Mahottari got admitted to Provincial Covid-19 Hospital in Janakpur for treatment. The 54-year-old woman was immediately put on ventilator support because of her critical condition.But her condition worsened after the ventilator went out of order after some time.“We requested doctors to manage another ventilator, but the doctors told us that all the ventilators at the hospital were not in working condition,” said the woman’s son.The patient was still in the ventilator ward of the hospital on Thursday but without ventilator support. Her condition is still critical, her son told the Post.Dr Manish Pandey, spokesperson of the hospital, says the hospital has five ventilators but all of them are out of order. “The ventilators were purchased last year. None of them are working now. The hospital is trying to get them repaired.” There were 31 critical Covid-19 patients from Dhanusha and Mahottari districts at the hospital on Thursday. The Health Ministry has put Dhanusha among 19 districts outside Kathmandu Valley where coronavirus infections are spreading “dangerously”. According to Pramod Yadav, medical superintendent of the Provincial Hospital, they have asked the provincial government to send new ventilators. “The government sent two new ventilators on Wednesday. We are preparing to install them and hopefully will be able to run them,” he said. On Thursday, Provincial Covid-19 Hospital, set up last year by the provincial government inside the premises of Janakpur Nursing College, was crowded with Covid-19 patients and their attendants.Some patients’ attendants said they were buying medicines even though the treatment for Covid-19 is free of cost at government hospitals.“We are purchasing medicines from outside,” said the son of the 54-year-old Covid-19 patient from Matihani. According to him, the same health workers who are assigned to non-Covid-19 patients are tasked with the treatment of the Covid-19 patients. “I have to run and call for a doctor from the other wards to take a look at my mother in the Covid-19 ward. It’s chaos here,” he said. Dr Manish Pandey, spokesperson of the Provincial Covid-19 Hospital in Janakpur, says the shortage of health workers has hit the hospital hard. “Health workers of Provincial Hospital in Janakpur have been assigned to work at the Provincial Covid-19 Hospital here. They are working at both hospitals,” said Pandey. “The provincial government did not manage human resources, medical equipment and necessary medicines on time. Now we are pooling all our resources together to run the Covid-19 hospital.”According to him, both Provincial Hospital and Provincial Covid-19 Hospital are being operated with a limited manpower. “The Covid-19 hospital has only provided supplemental oxygen and beds free of cost,” said Pandey, adding that medicines, meals, drinking water and other necessary items are being managed by Covid-19 patients themselves. However, Gyanendra Yadav, minister of infernal affairs and law for the province, also the spokesperson of the provincial government, claimed that the government has been providing treatment and medicines to Covid-19 patients free of cost “We haven’t been able to provide meals to patients due to staff shortage.” The Provincial Hospital had demanded 91 health workers to operate the High Dependency Unit and 91 employees for the Provincial Covid-19 Hospital. The initial plan for the Provincial Covid-19 Hospital had 100 beds but only 63 beds were set up due to a lack of infrastructure and health workers.Pramod Yadav, medical superintendent at the Provincial Hospital, said: “Currently, the Provincial Covid-19 Hospital is running only 63 beds out of which 12 are ICU beds and 41 have oxygen supply. The rest are being operated as general beds.”Last year, the provincial government had decided to make Janakpur’s Manipal Hospital as the Covid-19 Specific Hospital to expand and expedite the fight against Covid-19. A Cabinet meeting of the provincial government had opened 227 posts for health workers for the operation of the Covid-19 hospital. But the hiring of health workers is still under process.The government had also decided to add 417 temporary posts of health workers in various hospitals and laboratories in the province but the decision has not been implemented yet. Minister Yadav said the government was working on a war footing to bring the Covid-19 hospital in Manipal into operation within 20 days. “All of the decisions of the government will be implemented soon,” he said.","Published at : May 7, 2021",Dhanusha,Santosh Singh
A man died outside a pharmacy after three hospitals in Janakpur turned him away,"Forty-five-year-old Lok Bahadur Pariyar had been suffering from fever for the past few days. He took paracetamol tablets to bring his temperature down. Soon he also complained of having a common cold and severe body ache. When he reached Subodh Sah’s pharmacy on Monday, he was complaining of difficulty in breathing. He showed all symptoms of Covid-19, says the pharmacist.Sah advised Pariyar, a resident of Bateshwar Rural Municipality-4 in Dhanusha, to go to Janakpur for treatment since he suspected that Pariyar had Covid-19.“He was asking me for medicines. His condition was already very serious when he arrived here,” said Sah. “So I called for an ambulance and sent him to Janakpur.” Little did the pharmacist know that Pariyar would take his last breath outside his pharmacy less than 24 hours later. The ambulance left for Janakpur with Pariyar at around 7 pm on Monday. Pariyar was chatting with the driver Rambabu Mahato on the way to the hospital. He soon complained of shortness of breath and asked for help from Mahato, who administered him with oxygen. Pariyar’s residence in Bateshwar-4 is about 16km from Janakpur, the headquarters of Province 2.The ambulance reached Janakpur Provincial Hospital, a designated Covid-19 hospital, at around 8pm. The oxygen level in Pariyar’s body had dropped to 48 when he reached the provincial hospital. After conducting a health check-up on Pariyar, doctors at the hospital asked the patient to go to another hospital since all Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds at the hospital were occupied.“I took him to the provincial hospital. The doctors said he had to be admitted to the ICU as his oxygen level was very low but they did not have any bed available,” said Mahato. Mahato took Pariyar back to the ambulance and went to Janaki Health Care Hospital, a private hospital in Janakpur. The hospital had ICU beds but its administration asked the patient to pay Rs 13,000 per day for a bed in the ICU. Pariyar could not afford to be treated at the private hospital so he asked Mahato to take him to another hospital. By the time the duo reached Ram Janaki Hospital, Pariyar’s health condition had worsened, says Mahato.Ram Janaki Hospital also refused treatment to Pariyar, stating that the treatment cost was expensive there.Since all three hospitals turned him away, Mahato says Pariyar decided to return home. The duo drove back to Bateshwar Chowk at around 10pm. “I drove him to three hospitals but none took him in. He asked me to take him back home saying that he could not afford treatment in costly private hospitals,” said Mahato.Mahato dropped Pariyar at the chowk.The next morning, pharmacist Sah found Pariyar standing outside his pharmacy. “I was shocked to see him there. He said he went home at night but couldn’t sleep for he could not breathe properly,” Sah told the Post. “When I asked him about his visit to the hospital, he said none of the three hospitals he visited were willing to take him in. He requested me to give him medicines and treat him.”Pariyar then sat down to catch his breath and soon collapsed. He never woke up.“I don’t know whether he had gone to other places for treatment. When he came to me on Monday evening, he was already in a critical condition. I thought it best to send him to Janakpur for treatment but sadly he died for want of treatment,” said Sah. According to the Bateshwar Police Post, Pariyar, who ran an eatery, lived alone at his in-laws’ house. His wife and other family members live in India. Nepal Army personnel took Pariyar's body from the chowk. They also collected swab samples from the body and sent it to the Province Public Health Laboratory in Janakpur for Polymerase Chain Reaction testing. The test report is yet to come.The Janakpur-based provincial hospital has 12 ICU beds. According to Dr Pramod Yadav, the medical superintendent at the provincial hospital, only 10 patients were admitted in the ICU till Monday evening. “The hospital has to admit patients if the beds are empty. I am still inquiring about what happened in Pariyar’s case,” said Yadav.The Post tried to contact both Janaki Health Care Hospital and Ram Janaki Hospital but the hospital administrations did not want to comment on Pariyar’s case.","Published at : May 5, 2021",Janakpur,Ajit Tiwari
Division Forest Office in Rautahat facing difficulties evicting encroachers from forest area,"One-and-a-half-decades ago, the national forest area adjacent to Betauna Village in Ward No. 8 of Chandrapur Municipality used to be covered in greens. But now, encroachers have moved in and turned the area into a human settlement.The Division Forest Office in Rautahat has yet to recover the forest land from the encroachers. According to forest officials, they are facing difficulties evicting encroachers from the forest area due to a lack of clear government policy and initiatives. “There should be coordination at the local level and budget should be allocated for the eviction drive,” said Ram Prasad Sah, assistant forest officer of the Division Forest Office in Rautahat. “Another major reason why forest officials are facing difficulty evicting encroachers is political influence. The encroachers are backed by political parties.”Three years ago, the Division Forest Office had tried to evict encroachers from the Chure area. But the District Administration Office did not let the forest office continue the eviction drive, Sah said.“The district office directed the forest office to stop the drive, citing some political situation,” said Sah.The Chief District Officer is also the coordinator of the committee that oversees forest encroachment. According to the Division Forest Office in Rautahat, the forest office could not evict encroachers from the Chure forest area due to political pressure.“The forest office had made several efforts to evict encroachers from the Betauna area. But we were stopped from doing our job. Now, a settlement has been formed in the Betauna area,” said Sah.According to Sah, 1,425 hectares of forest cover in the Chure area has been encroached upon in the name of landless squatters. “This has also affected the President Chure Conservation Programme,” said Sah. According to the Division Forest Office, forest encroachment is rampant mainly in the national forest under Dhansar, Gaidatar and Paurai Sub Division Forest Offices. Out of a total of 29,400 hectares of forest cover in Rautahat, 3,190 hectares have been encroached upon. Residents of Chandrapur, Bagmati, Betauna, Nayabasti, Banbohari, Balarikhor, Chocha and Maura have constructed houses and cultivated crops in the forestland.According to the forest office, the local people have been encroaching on the national forest in the Bholantar area for years. The forest office said it upped surveillance in the area this year, keeping in view the possible encroachment of the forest land. “The locals make a fence in the forest land overnight and start cultivating the area. People from Dhiyal of Makwanpur and other districts have been staying in encroached forest land. We are unable to evict them due to the pressure of various political parties,” said a forest employee preferring anonymity. According to him, around two hectares of forest land were encroached upon during the lockdown last year. People who claim to be landless squatters set up a settlement in the forest area in Chandrapur Municipality Ward No 8, he said. Meanwhile, Sukaman Gole, a landless squatter in Bholantar, said the government should take responsibility to manage a proper settlement for landless squatters. “We will not encroach forestland if we have land plots to construct houses,” Gole said.","Published at : May 1, 2021",Rautahat,Shiva Puri
Covid-19 patients sharing beds at Narayani Hospital,"The scene at Narayani Hospital on Monday was grim with upto three Covid-19 patients languishing in one bed. The Birgunj-based hospital in Parsa district is struggling to cope with the steady flow of coronavirus patients in light of a shortage of beds and other necessary supporting infrastructure.The hospital has divided the Emergency Department into two sections—one is for non-Covid emergency cases and the other is an isolation ward dedicated to the treatment of coronavirus patients. “Both the sections are now overwhelmed with coronavirus patients,” said Dr Saroj Das. “All 49 beds at the hospital are occupied by Covid-19 patients and all of them are on supplemental oxygen.” According to him, the hospital has not admitted any asymptomatic patients.“The coronavirus situation in Birgunj is turning critical. New cases with severe symptoms are being brought to the hospital every day,” Dr Niraj Kumar Singh, a senior physician at the hospital, told the Post. “Authorities should have prohibited public movement in Birgunj and its vicinity a long time ago. A strict lockdown must be imposed immediately to prevent the further spread of the virus.” According to Singh, the hospital has been using 50 large oxygen cylinders every day for the treatment of coronavirus patients. “I’m getting calls from coronavirus patients and their relatives asking for beds at the hospital,” he said. “The hospital has already taken patients beyond its capacity.”The hospital has also set up a 48-bed isolation ward to accommodate the rising number of Covid-19 patients. “However, the hospital does not have enough health workers for the smooth operation of the new ward,” said Das. “The District Covid-19 Crisis Management Centre has said it will deploy more health workers for the new isolation ward.”On April 11, the meeting of the District Covid-19 Crisis Management Centre suggested turning Baba Hospital, managed by National Medical College, into a temporary Covid-19 hospital. The crisis management centre has put in a request to the Ministry of Health and Population for the same. “We have already notified the ministry on the matter. But we have not received any response yet,” said Bhimkant Paudel, assistant chief district officer of Parsa.In the past two weeks, 835 individuals tested positive for the coronavirus in Narayani Hospital alone.Meanwhile, the number of people entering Nepal from India through the Birgunj customs point has not decreased.Eight people entering Nepal from the customs point tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday. According to Mahammad Sainullaha Hawari, a health assistant deployed along the Nepal-India border in Birgunj, eight out of 40 people who underwent antigen tests at the health desk set up in the border point were diagnosed with the virus.“The infected people are Indian nationals from various places of Bihar. They were sent back to India from the border point,” said Hawari. According to him, health officials at the border health desk have conducted antigen tests of around 1,100 people entering Nepal since April 5. “As many as 77 of them have tested positive for Covid-19 since then. Of them, 70 are Indian nationals,” said Hawari.Health workers and security personnel deployed at the border area have called for strict border control in light of many infected Indian nationals crossing into Nepal.“It will be difficult to control the spread of the virus if we keep our borders open. There is no alternative to sealing the border immediately,” said Hawari.Hundreds of Nepali migrant workers and Indian nationals enter Nepal from Birgunj customs point every day. Most of the Indian nationals come to Birgunj to get their eyes treated. There are around half a dozen eye hospitals in Birgunj Metropolis. People from several towns and villages near the Nepal-India border come to Birgunj, as eye treatment is cheaper and reliable on this side of the border.Health workers deployed at the border estimate that around 20,000 people enter Nepal through the Birgunj border point on foot every day. But the border health desk conducts health examinations of around 300 entrants only for they have limited resources. The health desk does not examine people crossing the border on vehicles. Two health workers, two auxiliary health workers and two lab technicians have been deployed in the health desk at Birgunj border point, said Hawari.","Published at : April 26, 2021",Birgunj,Bhusan Yadav						 &
Siraha residents feel insecure after spate of violent crimes,"A series of violent crimes such as murder and armed robbery in the last few months in Siraha has spread fear in the local community.On Monday evening, an armed gang looted a house belonging to Rajesh Sarada, a Lahan-based bullion trader, in Lahan Municipality-7. In a similar incident, armed robbers murdered jeweller Pradip Bishwakarma and injured his wife in Lahan-23 on April 10. Armed robbers also looted Bindeshwar Yadav, another local, in Lahan-2 on April 5.The local people have expressed deep concerns about their safety in light of such growing criminal activities. A blast at the Lahan-based Land Revenue Office on March 14 left two government employees and six service seekers injured when an improvised explosive device went off at the busy government office. A 28-year-old man was hacked to death in Mirchaiya Municipality-7 a month ago and one local man of Bariyapatti Rural Municipality-5 has gone missing for the past four days. One rape case and another attempted rape case, according to police, were also reported in the district within the past month. The local people and bullion traders of Lahan have been protesting on the streets demanding justice for the deceased and other victims of arson and robbery for the past one week. “Criminal activities occur almost every day in the district. People are in absolute terror due to the recurring incidents of crimes,” said Raj Kumar Kurmi, a human rights activist in Siraha. “People have lost faith in the police and feel that security must be tightened in Lahan.” The business community has demanded the district administration, security agencies and other concerned authorities to control the criminal activities and provide security. The business community, civil society and general public organised an all party meeting in Lahan on Wednesday which was attended by the Chief District Officer, senior officers of Nepal Police and Armed Police Force and mayor of Lahan Municipality.“Traders are compelled to move to other locations if the security continues to be lax in Lahan. It is difficult to run businesses in such an atmosphere,” said Abdul Karim, the general secretary of Siraha Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The business community has announced a series of protests from Friday. Chief District Officer Pradeep Raj Kandel and Superintendent of Police Sidipraj Bhandari assured that they have left no stone unturned to curb the criminal activities and maintain peace and security in the district. “We have launched a special security plan in the district. The criminals cannot be spared at any cost,” said Kandel.The bullion traders, who have been protesting since Sunday, warned that they would keep their shops shuttered unless the administration assures them safety. “We cannot run our business amid looting, robbery and murder. Our protest will continue unless the district administration maintains law and order,” said Shyam Sah, the chairman of Lahan Bullion Traders Organisation.","Published at : April 16, 2021",Siraha,Bharat Jargha Magar
Armed robbers kill jewellery shop owner in Siraha,"An armed group of robbers looted a jewellery shop early Sunday morning and attacked its owner, Pradip Bishwakarma, who succumbed to his injuries at Saptarishi Hospital in Lahan the same day.The group of six looters barged into Bishwakarma’s jewellery shop and attacked him and his wife Amita Ruchal with a Khukuri before shooting Bishwakarma in the chest. The incident occurred at around 1am on Sunday morning. Critically injured Bishwakarma was immediately rushed to the hospital. “He succumbed to his injuries and was pronounced dead at 4:30am,” said Deputy Superintendent of Police Tapan Kumar Dahal. According to him, Bishwakarma had wounds on his head, face, arms and chest. Amita was discharged after receiving treatment at Saptarishi Hospital, he added. According to the District Police Office, the assailants also looted two tolas of gold, five kilograms of silver and Rs 200,000 from the shop. Bishwakarma, a resident of Barchhawa in Lahan-22, had been operating his jewellery shop from a rented building at Gadhiya Chowk. He and his family lived in the same building. Police investigation shows that the assailants climbed the roof of the house using a ladder, broke the lock and entered the room.According to Amita, upon entering the room, the looters indiscriminately assaulted Bishwakarma with a Khukuri until he collapsed. “Then they shot him in the chest saying that he recognised them,” she said. Bishwakarma’s three children were also in the house when the tragic incident took place. Following the incident, all the shops in Gadhiya remained closed on Sunday. Local residents said the security personnel took half an hour to reach the incident site even though they were informed as soon as the crime took place. “The policemen arrived here only after the injured were taken to the hospital in an ambulance,” said Tej Narayan Thakur, a local resident. The local people demanded that the criminals be brought to book at the earliest and security be tightened in the area.Police have arrested two suspects in connection with the incident. “The suspects were held with an iron bar. Detailed investigation into the incident is underway,” said Dahal.A similar incident was reported in Lahan-2 on Monday last week. A group of seven/eight assailants looted a house belonging to Bindeshwar Sah and took away cash and valuables worth Rs 600,000. The looters assaulted Sah and his wife with an iron rod. “Both the incidents are similar in nature. We are investigating the cases accordingly,” said Dahal.","Published at : April 12, 2021",Siraha,Bharat Jargha Magar

Province 2 districts vulnerable to Covid-19 resurgence but preparedness sorely lacking,"All eight districts in Province 2 share borders with India but Parsa and Bara are seeing the largest cross-border movement of people than any other districts.With India struggling with the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic, which is said to peak in the next few weeks, health authorities are worried about the rise in the number of Covid-19 cases in border areas. The authorities, particularly in the border areas, are sorely underprepared to handle a surge in infection.Since the beginning of this month, the number of Covid-19 patients has increased in Parsa. According to the data of Narayani Hospital in Birgunj Metropolitan City, the district headquarters of Parsa, 24 individuals tested positive for the disease in the last two days alone. The hospital, which was designated as a Covid-19 treatment hospital at the height of the pandemic last year, is not fully equipped to treat the coronavirus patients. Other hospitals in Birgunj also lack preparations and resources to handle Covid-19 cases. This has left Parsa highly vulnerable.Dr Saroj Roshan Das, information officer of Narayani Hospital, said currently four Covid-19 patients are receiving treatment in the emergency unit of the hospital. “The hospital is not in a position to admit more Covid-19 patients at the moment,” said Das. The hospital is setting up an intensive care unit and a high dependency unit for the treatment of Covid-19 patients. The two units are expected to be completed shortly.Das said the Ministry of Health and Population has directed every hospital in the district to separate 30 percent of their beds for the treatment of Covid-19 patients. Fifty-one individuals died of Covid-19 in Parsa in the past one year, according to the data of the Provincial Health Directorate. Similarly, out of 30,000 swab samples collected for testing, the results of over 3,000 samples came back positive for the coronavirus infection. A large number of Covid-19 patients had to stay in home isolation last year due to bed shortages, and health officials fear the situation could get much worse this time around. “Covid-19 cases could explode if the border points are not monitored strictly. The situation can get worse in Birgunj, ” said Dr Udayanarayan Singh, head of the Emergency Unit in Narayani Hospital. Singh suspects that the current active Covid-19 cases in Parsa district could be much higher given the low test numbers. “The rate of swab collection and testing is low. As a result, very few cases are being reported these days,” said Singh. “The number of cases in Parsa will be much higher if swab collection and testing processes are expedited.” Meanwhile, Bara district has also begun seeing an uptick in the number of Covid-19 cases. According to the District Health Office in Bara, 19 individuals tested positive in the last three days, prompting local governments to reintroduce tracing, testing and treatment of Covid-19 patients. Both Parsa and Bara districts share an open border with East Champaran in Bihar, India. Kalaiya Sub-Metropolitan City, district headquarters of Bara, is struggling in its effort to contain Covid-19 infections. The only polymerase chain reaction (PCR) machine which was purchased five months ago to conduct Covid-19 testing has not been put to use because the local government has yet to secure approval from the National Public Health Laboratory. Kalaiya and other local units in Bara had invested Rs 10 million for the machine and other additional accessories. According to the sub metropolis, the machine was purchased at a cost of Rs 8.5 million.The machine that can test 96 swab samples at a time was installed at Kalaiya Hospital at a cost of Rs 10 million. “A lot of money was spent in procuring and installing the machine but it is yet to be operated. This has deprived the citizens of their right to healthcare,” said Upendra Prasad Yadav, mayor of Mahagadhimai Municipality. The machine was purchased without permission from the National Public Health Laboratory. The sub metropolis had also appointed 11 employees including technicians to operate the machine. “The federal and the provincial government have not given us permission to operate the machine. This is the main reason behind the machine remaining unused,” said Rajeshraj Yadav, mayor of Kalaiya Sub Metropolis..According to him, technical employees, who were appointed to operate the machine, have also been released. “We have frequented the Ministry of Social Development and Provincial Health Directorate seeking permission to run the machine. But they said we have to seek permission to run the machine from the centre,” said Rajeshraj. Ajaya Jayasawal, the public health inspector of Kalaiya Sub Metropolis, says the District Administration Office in Bara, had also notified the higher authority seeking permission to run the machine. “But we are still awaiting permission to use the machine. With Covid-19 cases on the rise again, it is imperative for the sub-metropolis to start tracing and testing. This is the only way to keep a check on the further spread of the virus.” Dr Gaurav Mahato, Medical Superintendent of Kalaiya Hospital, points at the increasing number of Covid-19 patients in Bara. “The number of Covid cases has been increasing day by day. We hope to start PCR testing once the issue is resolved.” In the past year, more than 30 individuals died of Covid-19 in Bara, the data of the District Health Office showed. Health officials say in the absence of timely intervention from authorities, Bara will once again be gripped with Covid-19 cases.“Bara is at risk of spread of Covid-19 since the district shares an open border with India. We are waiting for Kalaiya and other local units to get permission to use the machine,” said Ram Naresh Yadav, chief at the District Health Office. “The district administration has yet to establish health desks at the border points. This has increased the threat of virus spread.”","Published at : April 9, 2021",Parsa/bara,Shankar Acharya						 &
Chamari-Thori road project draws ire,"The local people of Thori Rural Municipality in Parsa have expressed their dissatisfaction over the handing over of the Chamari-Thori section of Postal Highway. The contractor handed over the 30km road stretch to the government in an incomplete state, local residents say. The Chamari-Thori road project was initiated under the second package of the Postal Highway in Parsa.Around five kilometres of the road stretch is yet to be completed, says Prakash Khanal, a civil society leader and a local resident of Thori Rural Municipality Ward No. 1. “The construction of a 200metre stretch in the eastern side of Thute stream that borders wards 2 and 3 and around a kilometre’s stretch in Hanumantar Danda of ward no. 2 has been left incomplete,” said Khanal. “The construction of the road stretch cannot be termed completed since sections of the road are yet to be built.” For the local residents of Thori, the construction of the road is a priority since the Birjung-Thori stretch of the Postal Highway gives them direct access to Birgunj. According to Pradhumna Gautam, a local resident, the local people have been demanding authorities to construct the road section for the last three decades. “This road is our lifeline because this is the only major road that passes through Thori. The completion of this section will ensure easy mobility and shorter commute time for us,” said Gautam. The local people plan to stage a protest against the contractor’s handing over of the incomplete road section. An all-party meeting called in Thori recently formed the Incomplete Postal Highway Road Construction Struggle Committee to organise protests, saying the contractor has violated the terms of agreement of the road project. The meeting was attended by Ram Prakash Kunwar, chairman of Thori Ward No. 1; Kishor Tamang, chairman of Thori Ward No. 2; Bal Kumar Basnet, chairman of Nirmal Thori Consumers Committee under the buffer zone of Chitwan National Park; and local residents.“We will intensify our protest programmes if the contractor company and the government do not listen to us,” said Gautam. The road project was initiated at the total cost of Rs 1.17 billion. On October 30, 2017, the contractor company Baniya/Kalika JV had agreed to complete the construction of the road by May 15, 2020. The deadline for the project was extended due to the nationwide lockdown last year amid the Covid-19 pandemic.Uddhav Neupane, the field in-charge of the contractor company, says the project remains incomplete due to technical difficulties. “The construction work of around five kilometres of the road section has been left incomplete due to various reasons. Works on the road section in Nirmalbasti, Ward No. 4, were affected because of a dispute in the land acquisition process. In wards 2 and 3, the Chitwan National Park did not allow us to cut down some trees,” he said. “These issues can’t be solved by the contractor company alone. The government has to step in. Only then can we proceed with the construction work.”According to the contractor company, construction of the road in sections where they faced no objections have been completed. “It was impossible to broker a deal with the local level and with the park authorities so the contractor decided to hand over the project to the government in its incomplete state,” said Neupane. “We handed over the road project to the consultant, which in turn handed over the project to the Nepal government.” Indian firm National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited was the technical consultant of the project which was funded by the Indian government.“The government has to resolve land acquisition disputes and if it invites re-tender or assigns us to work again, we are ready to complete the construction work,” said Neupane.The construction of the Postal Highway, a national pride project, was initiated in the fiscal year 2006/07 with an aim to complete it within 2017/18. Postal Highway roads interlink parts of southern Tarai and also connect Nepal and India through Bhadrapur in Jhapa and Dodhara Chandani in Kanchanpur.","Published at : April 6, 2021",Parsa,Shankar Acharya
Seven girls missing from Mahottari since Tuesday afternoon found,"Seven girls who had gone missing from Bhangaha Municipality in Mahottari district on Tuesday afternoon have been found in Bihar, India on Wednesday.According to the District Police Office, Indian police have informed that the seven missing girls were found in Sitamarhi in the Indian state of Bihar. All seven girls are in good health, said police.Bhangaha Municipality mayor Sanjib Sah informed that the girls were found across the border in India. ""A team from Nepal police is heading towards the Indian side to take custody of the girls and they will be handed over to their parents,"" he said. Sah believes that the young girls could not have made their way across the border on their own.“It is impossible for these children to reach the Indian side without the involvement of someone,” said Sah, “Police should conduct a detailed investigation and take necessary action if anyone is found guilty of taking the girls across the border without their consent.” According to the family members of the girls, aged between 10-18 years and all of them from Dharampur in the municipality, the girls had gone to collect fodder for cattle at a farm in the nearby Ajgewa village at around 2pm yesterday and had not returned home since.

"Missing elderly couple found buried at road construction site in Pipara, Mahottari","The bodies of an elderly couple who had gone missing on February 22 in Pipara, Mahottari, were found buried at the Pipara-Atara road construction site on Thursday.A special investigation team of the District Police Office in Mahottari discovered the bodies of 66-year-old Musafir Jha and his 60-year-old wife Geeta Devi. The belongings recovered from the incident site helped identify the couple, said police.The incident site where the bodies were recovered is 3.5 kilometres from the couple’s house. The couple was abducted from Sahodwa in Ward No. 5 of Pipara Rural Municipality in February. Their whereabouts were unknown, according to the Provincial Police Office in Janakpur. On Sunday, police made public four individuals on the charge of abducting the couple. The District Police Office in Mahottari had organised a press meet and charged a case of abduction against them.“The bodies were found at Pipara Rural Municipality Ward No. 2 along the Pipata-Atara road section,” said Dhiraj Pratap Singh, deputy inspector general of police and also the chief at the Provincial Police Office in Janakpur. “The bodies were found buried at a diversion site. Musafir’s body was found in a sack while his wife’s body was buried nearby. The perpetrators also used salt to decompose the bodies”The Pipata-Atara road is undergoing a second phase of construction.“The couple was murdered in their home. The bodies were then buried at the road construction site,” said Superintendent of Police in Mahottari Dinesh Acharya.The family of the deceased and the neighbours suspect that the couple was killed because of a land dispute issue. “On the morning of February 22, I went to check on my in-laws since it was unusual for them not to come out of their rooms. I went in and they weren’t there. The room had bloodstains. I immediately informed the neighbours and called the police,” said Usha Devi, Musafir’s daughter-in-law. Musafir had retired from a job at the District Land Revenue Office in Mahottari 10 years ago after almost four decades of employment. Police investigation shows that he was currently advocating for a land case related to tenants’ rights of a neighbouring village in the Land Management Office in Jaleshwor. Following the incident, on February 23, the local residents of Sahodwa in Pipara had staged demonstrations and obstructed vehicular movement along the Jaleshwor-Janakpur road demanding prompt investigation into the case. “Among the arrested individuals, Harendra Thakur, a native of Madhuwani in India currently residing in Pipara, is involved in real estate business. He had been plotting 13 bighas of land in Sahodwa. The deceased (Musafir) owns 14 bighas of land on the northern part of the plotted land. Thakur had been putting pressure on Musafir to sell his land but Musafir had refused,” said SP Acharya.“This is a senseless murder,” said Usha Devi. “My in-laws were killed because of a land issue. The administration should take strong action against the perpetrators.”","Published at : March 26, 2021",Dhanusha,Santosh Singh						 &
Province 2 on high alert as India reports rise in Covid-19 cases,"Health officials have suggested authorities concerned and the residents of eight districts in Province 2 that share a border with India to stay on high alert, as cases of Covid-19 are on the rise in the southern neighbour.Province 2 shares a 460-kilometre-long open border with India, which has worried health workers of a possible outbreak of Covid-19 in Nepal.“A large number of Nepali migrant workers will return home from India to celebrate the upcoming Holi festival. It is essential that these returnees follow strict health security protocols while entering Nepal. The use of face masks and social distancing measures should be followed to control the possible spread of Covid-19,” said Dr Niraj Kumar Singh, a senior physician at Birgunj-based Narayani Hospital.Health workers on Saturday set up a desk at the railway station in Raxaul, the bordering Indian town across Birgunj, to examine the health of the returnees arriving from various towns of India. According to Singh, three people who arrived in Birgunj from Kolkata and Mumbai a few days ago were diagnosed with pneumonia.The Covid-19 Crisis Management Centre on Thursday recommended the federal government to resume cross-border transportation between Nepal and India. The Nepal-India border has been sealed since March last year to contain a possible outbreak of the virus. However, local residents say that despite the border closure, people have been crossing into the country through border areas with no security presence.Following the rise in the number of Covid-19 patients in bordering Indian cities, the District Administration Office in Rautahat has started keeping a record of returnees from India.“Not many people are returning from India these days. But we have set up a health desk in the Gaur-based border point to keep a record of returnees. They have been told to stay in their houses for a few days,” said Chief District Officer of Rautahat Indradev Yadav.According to Yadav, only pedestrians are allowed to cross the border point at present. “Vehicles are not allowed to enter from the bordering areas,” said Yadav.In mid-April 2020, Covid-19 infection was reported in over 1,000 returnees who had returned to Rautahat from India.Meanwhile, in Sarlahi, the administration is facing difficulties in keeping a record of returnees, as people are sneaking into the district by taking advantage of the porous open border.“The District Administration Office has tightened security along the border to stop illegal border crossings,” said Chief District Officer of Sarlahi Hem Raj Tamang.According to him, the federal government has not said anything regarding the opening of the border points or maintaining a high alert along the border. “But we are adopting health safety measures to keep in check the Covid-19 infection rate,” said Tamang. The border points in Sarlahi have been closed for the past year.(Om Prakash Thakur in Sarlahi and Shiva Puri in Rautahat contributed reporting)","Published at : March 24, 2021",Birgunj,Bhusan Yadav
"Ten years on, Kamala bridge yet to come into operation","The construction of a 470-metre long bridge across Kamala River that connects Dhanusha and Siraha districts started some 10 years ago. During the same period, two road sections were built on both ends of the under-construction bridge to link it to the Postal Highway. Around 90 percent of the bridge construction work has been completed but the bridge won’t be open to the public any time soon since the roads leading to the bridge have been washed away by floodwaters in the river. Currently, there are no roads linked to the bridge since road stretches on either side were washed away by the river which can swell up to 1,200 metres wide during monsoon, say local residents.Last year, a 600-metre stretch of the blacktopped road, linking the western part of the bridge to Dhanusha, was swept away by the floodwaters. Bikram Yadav, coordinator of the Save Kamala campaign, said that the bridge cannot be used as there’s a risk of erosion during monsoon floods.“The construction of the bridge is almost complete now but we will not be able to use it since there is no road connection,” said Krishna Kumar Mahato, chief at the Postal Highway Directorate Project Office in Janakpur. The bridge project was awarded to Pappu Constructions in June 2011. As per the contract agreement, the builder was expected to complete the bridge within three years. Due to the construction company’s delay in completing the bridge, authorities awarded the contract to Lumbini Builders two years ago.“The river has been changing its course frequently in the last decade. It has grown wider. The length of the bridge should be extended and embankments should also be constructed on both sides to keep floodwaters from washing away the roads,” said Yadav.According to Jayanath Yadav, a site engineer of the Postal Highway Directorate Project Office, works are being carried out to direct the course of the river towards the bridge area. “A 500-metre-long channel is being constructed to direct the flow of the river towards the bridge area,” he said. “The bridge will come into operation by mid-April.”","Published at : March 19, 2021",Dhanusha,Santosh Singh
Simara residents padlock warehouse of steel foundry over pollution issue,"On Wednesday, the local residents of Simara in Bara padlocked the warehouse of Jagdamba Steels. According to them, there is a small plant within the warehouse facility that causes incessant noise and vibration disturbance.“The disturbance is unbearable. Houses that are closer to the warehouse have developed cracks because of the tremor caused by large machines operating inside,” said Hira Basnet, a local man. “Earlier, the place used to be a storage but now it has turned into a full-fledged factory.” Resham Tiwari, another resident from the area, said they have been requesting the local authorities to control the noise pollution level, but without any success. “None of the authorities has paid attention to our concerns. We have to resort to protest and padlock the facility because we see no other option,” said Tiwari.Jagdamba Steels, meanwhile, claims that the company has taken necessary measures to control pollution levels at its facilities. “We have installed equipment to control pollution in our industrial area. The local people are wrong in claiming that we are causing pollution,” said Jagdamba CEO Anurag Sharma. “Our steel industry employs over 3,200 labourers. The protest by the locals has made the working environment unfavourable.” There are other industries in the Parsa-Bara Industrial Corridor that have been facing obstruction from locals from time to time.Around five years ago, local residents of Parwanipur staged a demonstration against environmental pollution caused by Narayani Oil and Trishakti Cement Industry. Following the protest, the company installed a plant to control pollution.Jas Pal Singh, an environmentalist based in Birgunj, says industries should adopt scientific methods in order to lower their pollution levels. “They should begin by at least replacing old machines. Both business entrepreneurs and local authorities should take initiatives to control pollution,” he said.Bhim Kanta Paudel, assistant chief district officer of Parsa, says legal action can be taken against the industries in question if the local residents file an official complaint. “So far we have not received any official complaints against the industries,” he said. Currently, there are over 1,000 small, medium and large scale industries operating in the Parsa-Bara Industrial Corridor, which spans about 25 km from Birgunj to Pathalaiya.The industry operators have been demanding that the government officially declare the area an industrial corridor.According to Subodh Kumar Gupta, chairman of Birgunj Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the industrial corridor is not supposed to have human settlements. When the corridor was set up around 40 years ago, he said there were settlements only in Jitpur, Simara, Parwanipur, Pathalaiya and Chhatapipra. “Now more people are moving into the industrial area, leading to confrontations between the settlers and the industries. The area is not meant for residential purpose,” said Gupta.The Birgunj Chamber of Commerce and Industry has long been urging the government authorities to formally declare the Parsa-Bara Industrial Corridor as an industrial area. Gopal Kedia, the immediate past chairman of the chamber, said that the business organisations have repeatedly made the request to the government but to no avail. “It will be enough if only the government made the declaration and prohibited construction of residential buildings close to the industrial area,” said Kedia.","Published at : March 19, 2021",Parsa,Shankar Acharya
Construction of railway track worries Chandrapur residents,"The 945-km East-West Electric Railway, also called the Mechi-Mahakali Electric Railway, passes from Bagmati to Laxminiya via Chandrapur in Rautahat district. However, local residents are worried that the construction of the railway track in Chandrapur might raise the risk of inundation in the area. Krishna Chaudhary, 49, a resident of Ward No. 8 in Chandrapur has his house on the northern side of the railway track. He says a dam-like structure is currently being constructed near his land, paving way for the installation of the railway track. “A platform around fifteen-feet high and culverts are being constructed for the railway track. We are worried about possible inundation during monsoon,” said Chaudhary. “The culverts are small and cannot hold floodwaters during monsoon.”Khadka Kushawar, chairman of Chandrapur Ward No. 6, said the newly built structure is expected to hold flood waters collected from the Chure hills. “The culverts are too small and limited in number so they might not be able to hold or direct floodwaters during the monsoon season. Authorities should think about a possible inundation threat to the settlements in the area,” Kushawar said. Subash Koirala, a local Nepali Congress leader in Santapur, whose house is also close to the railway track, said the local residents had visited the construction site a few days ago and inquired about water outlets from the dam. The construction company, however, did not have an answer to their query, said Koirala. Hectares of paddy fields in Betauna were inundated in the last monsoon, as the raised platforms constructed for laying the railway track blocked the flow of rainwaters. According to local residents, several settlements of wards 5, 6 and 8 of Chandrapur Municipality will be inundated due to the railway project.Devendra Sah, the divisional engineer at the Department of Railways, however, claimed that there is no threat of inundation, as enough culverts are being constructed to divert rainwaters. The Department has awarded the contract to construct the 17.8km long railway track from Bagmati to Laxminiya in Rautahat district in four phases. As per the agreement, the construction company should complete works in all four phases by February 2022.","Published at : March 14, 2021",Rautahat,Shiva Puri

"President removes Tilak Pariyar as Province 2 governor, appoints Rajesh Jha","President Bidya Devi Bhandari on Friday removed Tilak Pariyar as the governor of Province 2.According to a statement issued by the Office of the President, Bhandari removed Pariyar as the Province 2 governor as per Article 165 (1) of the constitution on the recommendation of the federal Council of Ministers.The President’s Office said that Rajesh Jha has been appointed the new Province 2 governor. Jha, usually known as Rajesh Ahiraj, is a journalist and holds a PhD on Madhesi issues. Jha is known as a staunch supporter of Oli.Pariyar was picked under the quota of the former CPN (Maoist Centre) and was appointed the governor on November 5, 2019.Besides Pariyar, two more governors were appointed in the quotas allotted to the former Maoist party.At that time, the Maoist Centre had already merged with then CPN-UML to form the united Nepal Commuist Party. The governors were appointed as per an understanding between the two communist forces.The removal of Pariyar as the governor follows a split in the Nepal Communist Party after Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s move to dissolve the House of Representatives. The Nepal Commuist Party is now split into two–one led by Oli and the other by Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Madhav Kumar Nepal.The reason behind Pariyar’s removal was not known immediately but a source from Oli’s orbit said that the decision could have been taken given Pariyar’s closeness with Dahal.Originally from Liwang, Rolpa, Pariyar is known as a popular Dalit leader in western Nepal. Pariyar, an active member during the Maoist movement, was elected twice to the Constituent Assembly.“I was surprised when I received an email from the Office of the President about my removal as the province governor,” Pariyar told the Post. He said he had tried to play his role independently, without any allegiance to any faction.But he doubted that his removal could have been guided by political vendetta, as he was appointed under the former Moist quota.Pariyar was appointed the head of Province 2 when the Oli government in November 2019 appointed governors to six other provinces after sacking those appointed by the Sher Bahadur Deuba government in 2017.All the governors were picked by a Secretariat meeting of the Nepal Communist Party. Somnath Adhikary was appointed governor of Province 1, Bishnu Prasai of Bagmati, Amik Sherchan of Gandaki, Dharmendra Yadav of Lumbini, Govinda Kalauni of Karnali and Sharmila Tripathi was appointed governor of Sudurpaschim.This story has been updated.","Published at : February 19, 2021",Kathmandu,Post Report
Mechi-Mahakali railway: Distribution of compensation for land delayed,"Residents of Chandrapur and Gujara Municipalities in Rautahat district have demanded that authorities provide them compensation for their plots of land acquired by the government to build the Bardibas-Nijgadh section of the Mechi-Mahakali Railway.Although officials began the process of acquiring land for the project in Ward No. 8 of Chandrapur and Ward No. 5 of Gujara a few months ago, the Department of Railways is yet to issue payments for the acquired land.The local residents have been frequenting the office of the Department of Railways for the compensation amount but to no avail. “Earlier, the land acquisition process was delayed because of the District Land Revenue and Survey offices,” an employee involved in the construction of the railway track said. Now, the distribution of the compensation amount has been delayed due to the Department of Railways. Devendra Sah, an official at the Department of Railways, accepted that the land acquisition process had been delayed because of the department. “The amount, which should be distributed to the landowners, has not been released from the Ministry of the Finance yet. We will issue the payment as soon as we receive the money,” said Sah. Farmers have been pressing the department for payment for the last nine months. According to the department, the acquisition process for 323 plots of land in Ward No. 5, 8, and in Chandrapur and Ward No. 5 in Gujara has started. Until now, farmers have received payment for 172 plots, according to the department.The compensation determination committee had fixed Rs1.1 million per kattha (0.083 acre) of land with road access and Rs800,000 per kattha for land without access to the road. The compensation amount for plots of land with irrigation facilities had been fixed at Rs500,000 per kattha while that for land without such facilities had been fixed at Rs400,000 per kattha. Landowners, who have not received the payment, had grown paddy, maize, mustard, and other cash crops on their fields. Ritulal Chaudhary, a farmer of Motipur in Ward No. 5 of Chandrapur, said, “I transferred the ownership of 11 katthas of land in the name of the Department of Railways two weeks ago. But, I have not received payment yet. The officials are just providing fake assurances.” Chief District Officer Indradev Yadav said, “Now, the land acquisition process has gained momentum after the district administration office directed them to speed things up. We have also received complaints against the survey office.” However, Sanjaya Sah, survey officer, denied the allegations. “We have not delayed in the railway’s land compensation work. The farmers will receive their compensation only after transferring ownership of the land plots. We are only responsible for mapping and survey works,” he said.Landowners get their payment through the district administration office. Residents of Motipur complain that they have to face hassles at the revenue and survey offices time and again. “We provided our cultivable land for the construction of the railway. But, we are facing unnecessary hassles due to the government workers,” said Chaudhary. Under the Bardibas-Nijgadh section of the Mechi-Mahakali railway, a 17.8 km railway track is to be constructed from Bagmati to Laxminiya. Under the first phase, a track is being constructed up to Lamaha. The 945-km East-West Electric Railway, also called the Mechi-Mahakali Electric Railway, is one of the government’s national pride projects.","Published at : February 7, 2021",Rautahat,Shiva Puri
Staffers in Dhanusha rural municipality hold sit-in demanding their pay,"Staffers, teachers, health workers and other employees drawing their salary from Dhanauji Rural Municipality, Dhanusha, have been holding a sit-in outside the civic body’s office for the last 18 days demanding pay as officials haven’t disbursed their salary for six months.With the rural municipality failing to convene the village assembly for a long time due to “political reasons”, the assembly could only meet on December 2 to approve the budget for the current fiscal year 2020-21.At least three ward chairpersons have blamed chairperson Badri Narayan Singh and chief administrative officer Kanyaiya Kumar Mishra for the delay in paying the staff their salary. But, Misrha told the Post that he has been trying to get the budget released from the District Treasury Office. Chairperson Singh, elected on a Nepali Congress ticket, does not have a majority in the village assembly. As Samajbadi Party, Nepal, and Nepal Communist Party hold a majority in the village assembly, their non-cooperation meant the assembly couldn’t convene on time and approve the budget.According to Mishra, chairperson Singh has the backing of 13 village assembly members while other parties have 17 seats. “So, a political consensus could not be reached for holding the assembly,” said Mishra. With delay in the presentation of the budget, the rural municipality failed to provide salary to the government staff. The local governments are responsible for distributing salary to federal government staffers, including teachers and health workers, using funds it receives in the form of conditional grants. Before distributing the salaries, the local governments need to incorporate the grants into their budget. “The government staffers have padlocked the rural municipality office,” said Mishra, chief administrative officer at the rural municipality. “Even I haven’t received a penny in salary since the beginning of the fiscal year.” “Vaccination programmes for children have also been halted,” Ram Mandal, chairperson of Ward No.1, told the Post. While Mishra attributed the tussle between the rural municipality chair and his opponents for the delay in payment of salaries, Mandal pointed his finger at the chairman and the chief administrative officer.“It has been one and half months since the village assembly convened. But the chairperson and the chief administrative officer have done little to ensure that all government staffers are paid their salary,” said Mandal.He accused Mishra of doing his own personal work at the district headquarter (Janakpur) for two months, instead of coming to the rural municipality regularly to run the office.This was not the first time that Dhanauji failed to get its budget approved on time. During the last fiscal year too, officials presented their budget before the village assembly only in February 2020, eight months after the deadline to do so.According to the Intergovernmental Fiscal Arrangements Act, local governments need to present their budget by June 25 every year. A number of the local governments are yet to present their budgets even seven months into the new fiscal year. According to the Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration, as many as 14 local governments, most of them from Province 2 are yet to present their budget for the current fiscal year. Ever since the local elections were held, a number of local governments have been failing to present their budget on time. But, there has been some improvement in the last three years. “Due to the delay in budget presentation, development works have also been badly affected in our rural municipality,” said Mishra. “Without the budget being approved, it’s not possible to invite bids for development projects.”A senior official at the federal affairs ministry told the Post on condition of anonymity that the presentation of local budgets has been delayed due to lack of consensus among elected representatives regarding the sharing of the budget for their own areas.“Disputes have been arising in the local assembly in cases where members are from different political parties,” the official said. “Even when elected representatives are from the same party, they have been unable to reach a consensus on sharing of the budget.”After observing that various local governments are not presenting their budget on time, the federal government has sought to amend the Local Level Operation Act. The federal affairs ministry, which drafted the amendment proposal, has proposed that the local government not be allowed to spend a single penny without getting its budget approved by the assembly. “We have proposed that the local government that fails to present its budget, will get a budget from the centre, but they cannot run their account without getting the budget endorsed,” the official said.Likewise, the federal and provincial governments shall also stop providing grants to local governments that fail to convene the assembly for two consecutive years, according to the proposal.","Published at : January 23, 2021",Kathmandu,Prithvi Man Shrestha
Frontline workers in Kalaiya Hospital deprived of Covid-19 risk allowance,"Health workers and other frontline workers at Kalaiya Hospital in Bara district have been protesting for the past one week demanding immediate release of Covid-19 risk allowance. Frontline health workers and employees working to contain Covid-19 and provide services to coronavirus patients are eligible for the allowance.A total of 105 workers of the hospital have been staging a sit-in in front of the hospital, suspending all work except in the emergency, gynaecology and OPD units. According to them, all of them are deprived of the risk allowance for the past 10 months.“The government has done injustice to the employees of the Covid-19 hospital. It had announced risk allowance for the employees mobilised in the frontline since March last year. But we have not received the allowance so far,” said Phul Mohammad Ansari, a technician working at the hospital’s laboratory. He said the health workers and employees were compelled to stage demonstrations, as they have been working without the risk allowance for a long time. “The health workers and employees of the district health office have already received the risk allowance but we have not,” said Ansari.The health authorities have turned Kalaiya Hospital into a Covid-19 hospital with an objective to provide treatment to coronavirus patients in the area. As many as 20 health workers and employees tested positive for the novel coronavirus during their deployment for the treatment of coronavirus patients.A budget of Rs 8 million allocated for the risk allowance froze in the last fiscal year as the then medical superintendent at the hospital Birendra Mandal did not issue the allowance to the health workers and employees on time. The federal government had released the amount to the hospital but Mandal failed to provide the allowance to the frontline workers.The Health Ministry in April last year had announced a 50 to 100 percent allowance to doctors, health workers and sanitation workers deployed in the frontline in the fight against Covid-19.“The federal government had announced a risk allowance 10 months ago. But we have not received any amount so far,” said Shobha Rajbanshi, an employee at the hospital. The protesting workers complained that they had been staging a sit-in since January 11 but the authorities concerned have paid no heeds to address their demands.Dr Sunil Kuswaha, the medical superintendent who was transferred to the hospital a few months ago, vowed to take an initiative to provide the workers with the allowance. “I’m not sure of last year’s risk allowance. The government has not issued the budget for the current fiscal year. I will release the allowance once it is provided to the hospital,” said Kuswaha.","Published at : January 18, 2021",Bara,Laxmi Shah
Province 2 residents most enthusiastic about finding jobs in civil service,"Residents of Province 2 topped the list of people applying for civil service jobs during the last fiscal year despite the province lagging in human development, particularly in terms of education.According to the Public Service Commission’s annual report for 2019-20 , 23.57 percent of total applications received by the constitutional body for public service jobs were from residents of Province 2. Province 5 with 17.06 percent was a distant second. Officials and experts believe that this may be a sign that the reservation system in the country is working.“The biggest factor behind high applications received from province 2 is the large size of the population in the province,” said Umesh Mainali, chairperson of the commission.According to the 2011 census, the population of Province 2 stands at 5.4 million—largest after Bagmati, which is home to 5.52 million people. Of the 451,526 applications the commission received during the year, 106,405 came from residents of Province 2, which has been topping the list for quite some time, according to the commission. During the previous fiscal year, 29 percent of total applications were from Province 2.The biggest pool of applications came from Saptari district followed by Sarlahi, Dhanusa, and Siraha. In fact, seven of the top 10 districts, in terms of the number of applications, are from Province 2. Only two districts outside of Province 2—Gulmi and Syangja— make it to the top 10.Province is considered one of the most backward regions of the country in terms of human development, according to the Nepal Human Development Report-2020 released by the National Planning Commission and United Nations Development Programme last month.According to the report, the human development index of the province stood at 0.51—the lowest in Nepal, even behind Karnali. From the perspective of geography, the Terai region as a whole score the lowest in terms of human development in Nepal compared to the hills and the mountains. “The Terai and Province 2 score the lowest on education, followed by income,” the report says. Mainali said that due to lack of resources, people don’t have the option of starting their own business, “Another reason is that the region is backward in human development and many people of the province want to join government jobs in the absence of adequate resources to start any businesses,” said Mainali. He believes that the availability of quotas for residents of Province 2 might have fuelled their aspirations to work government jobs. “The aspiration to join the government service was also fueled by quotas allocated for the Madhesi community as per the Civil Service Act 2007,” added Mainali.The new Civil Service Act was prepared in accordance with commitments made by major political parties towards inclusive development while ending the decade-long Maoist insurgency and the subsequent Madhes movement.The Civil Service Act 2007 makes it compulsory for 45 percent of recruits in civil service to come from marginalised communities. While filling vacant posts for section officers, 70 percent of the posts are filled through competition and the rest 30 percent is filled through promotions. Under the competition category, 45 percent of the seats are set aside for a separate competition among different clusters of communities from historically marginalised groups. As per the law, from the inclusion quota, 33 percent seats are reserved for women, 27 percent for indigenous nationalities, 22 percent for Madhesis, 9 percent for dalits, 5 percent for the disabled, and 4 percent for backward regions. The remaining 55 percent of seats are filled through an open competition.“The main reason behind the surge in the application is the policy of inclusion,” said Anil Thakur, a former government secretary, who hails from Mahottari “The policy of inclusion created opportunities for the Madhesi community which increased interest in civil service jobs.”The Public Service Commission has allowed applicants to write answers in both Nepali and English language in recent years and that too has allowed the Madhesi people, who don’t have a comparative advantage against the hill people in the Nepali language, to write in English.“In the past, the commission used to take exams only in Nepali. With the introduction of a policy on allowing the use of the English language, Madhesi people have been able to compete with the applicants from the hills,” said Thakur. The overall share of the community in civil service remains sizable. According to the Inclusion Watch, a journal published by Samabeshi Foundation, the share of members of the Madhesi community comprise 15.18 percent of total civil servants as of April 2013.Data from the Department of Civil Personnel Records, shows that 15.31 percent of Madhesis are employed in the classless category, 13.9 percent are non-gazetted, 18.76 percent are non-gazetted third class, 10.34 percent are gazetted second class, 10 percent are gazetted first class, and two percent special class. Recruitment in government service from Province 2 has also been good. In 2018-19, residents of the province topped the list of recommendations for recruitment. In that year, the commission recommended 20.55 percent of total candidates from Province 2. “Along with the policy of inclusion, people from the Madhesi community are also increasingly entering into the administrative category of civil service though the majority of them used to concentrate on technical fields in the past,” said Thakur.But, both Mainali and Thakur said that most of the civil service jobs have gone to the so-called higher caste and relatively higher-income people among the Madhesi communities. “Most low-income people have been forced to seek foreign employment,” said Thakur.","Published at : January 11, 2021",Kathmandu,Prithvi Man Shrestha
Bardibas villagers suffer from drinking water shortage,"Every day, Mina Pokharel, a resident of Bhapsi Ratmate in Ward No. 3 of Bardibas Municipality, Mahottari, spends three hours to bring home a vessel of water. According to her, 20 households in her neighbourhood rely on the communal water tap to meet their needs. “We get water in the tap every 15 days and it takes at least two hours to fill one vessel,” said Pokharel. “Some days, the tap goes dry even before we get a chance to fill our buckets.” Around 400 families in Ratmate, Bastipur and Raimandal villages in Ward No. 3 of Bardibas have been facing similar problems for the last five decades. They go to the neighbouring villages of Atappe Gaun and Bardanda, among others, in search of water. “We bring water from other villages in winter and summer. In monsoon, we use floodwaters for drinking purposes,” said Suka Bahadur Majhi, a resident of Ratmate.Bishnu Thapa, a local resident of Bastipur Tol, complained that the authorities and people’s representatives have not addressed their water shortage problem despite multiple requests. “In the dry season, we have to walk to Palla Gaun to fetch a vessel of water. It takes at least three hours to reach Palla Gaun from Bastipur Tol but we have no other source of water nearby,” said Thapa. Five years ago, the local residents had launched the Bhapsi Drinking Water Project under which a tap was installed in each house of the area. The project is nearing its deadline in the running fiscal year but there has been no progress so far, say villagers. “Water pipes were installed near the spring area only. The construction work of the project has not gained momentum for the last two years,” said Bijaya Pokharel, a resident of Ward No. 3 in Bardibas.Tara Bahadur Pulami, chairman of Bhapsi Drinking Water and Sanitation Consumers Committee, says the delay was caused because the Drinking Water and Sanitation Division Office in Mahottari has not released a budget for the continuation of the project. “We have been requesting the division office for budget allocation but nothing has been done yet,” he said. “The local residents had also put in a request with the division office but their calls went unheard.” The total cost of the project is Rs 30 million. So far, only the main supply pipes have been installed in the water spring area. According to the project officials, they have to construct a water tank and install pipes and taps in each house of the village. However, officials at the Drinking Water and Sanitation Division Office in Mahottari claim that despite the delays, the construction of the drinking water project will be completed within this current fiscal year. “The construction work has not moved forward, as the project did not receive a budget in the running fiscal year. But we plan to supply water in Ward No. 3 this year. We intend to complete the project this year,” said Surendra Sharma, chief at the office.","Published at : January 7, 2021",Mahottari,Sunita Baral

"Five bighas of forest land encroached in Bardibas, Mahottari","People have started encroaching the forest land of Ramtel Danda Community Forest in Bardibas, Mahottari in collusion with the forest officials, forest consumer committee, and Bardibas Municipality, local residents say.Around five bighas of the forest land have been encroached upon so far, they say.Recently, Lilamani Acharya and Krishna Prasad Gautam, local residents of Ward No. 1 in Bardibas, fell down more than 300 trees of the community forest and encroached forest land after their land plots were swept away by the floods of Bhapsi in the monsoon. Ramtel Danda Community Consumers Committee, Bardibas Municipality and the Division Forest Office in Mahottari had given permission to Gautam and Acharya to cut down trees, local residents say. The duo asked for permission to cut down trees, citing that their land plots fall under the forest cover. The Revenue Office in Bardibas has also verified the documents, saying that around five bighas of the forest land belong to Gautam and Acharya. The incident came to light after the local residents found out about the tree felling. Twenty-eight years ago, 21 hectares of Ramtel Danda Community Forest was handed to the community forest consumers committee. “They had shown the recommendation of the government offices before fencing around five bighas of the forest land,” said Bijaya Pokharel, a local resident of Bardibas Ward No. 1. “The people’s representatives, forest officials and government employees are all working in collusion.”The villagers have also filed a complaint to the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority. Fifty-one of them have signed the document and filed the complaint to the CIAA for a detailed investigation into the matter. “Land mafias are the reason why incidents like this continue to occur. The area of Ramtel Danda Community Forest is shrinking due to human encroachment. That’s why we have filed a complaint at the CIAA for investigation,” said Dipak Karki, a local resident of Ward No. 1 in Bardibas.According to Hemanta Prasad Sah, chief at the Division Forest Office in Mahottari, the ward office, forest consumers committee and revenue and survey offices have verified that the land belongs to Acharya and Gautam. “This is the reason why the forest office gave permission to cut down trees,” Sah said. Sher Bahadur Raut, chairman of the community forest, had provided recommendations for the tree felling, saying that the landowners have planted tree saplings in five bighas of land elsewhere. “I provided the recommendation to cut down trees on the basis of documents prepared by the Revenue and Survey Offices,” Raut said.Meanwhile, Chudamani Pokharel, ward chairman of Bardibas Ward No. 1, said his office provided recommendations to cut down trees after looking at the recommendations of the forest office, forest consumer committee and the survey office.Sah, however, said that an arrest warrant has been issued in the name of Gautam and Acharya on deforestation charges. The forest office has also suspended seven employees, including an assistant forest officer, and started an investigation into the case.The Post tried to contact both Acharya and Gautam, but their mobile phones were switched off.According to the Division Forest Office, 120 teak, 80 masala and 35 other trees in the five bighas of forest land were also cut down.“Most of the trees were felled along with their roots. Fifty tractors were used to transport the felled trees,” said Jagendra Shrestha, a local resident of Bardibas.","Published at : December 26, 2020",Mahottari,Sunita Baral
Agitation due to prolonged border closure in Province 2,"All eight districts of Province 2 that border India are pressuring the government to reopen the Nepal-India border. The border was sealed on March 21 to contain the spread of the coronavirus. In Parsa’s Birgunj, Sambad Samuha organised an hour-long sit-in in front of the Birgunj Customs for 22 days to pressurize authorities to open the border. On Saturday, the organisation cancelled its sit-in to prepare for other programmes like public awareness, all party interaction and signature collection campaign. Similarly, a sit-in programme to pressurize authorities to reopen the border has been continuous for the last two weeks in Sarlahi. Those participating in the sit-in have started falling sick due to the cold wave. “We are going to launch strong protest programmes in the coming days if our demands are not addressed. The border should be opened to ease our daily life,” said Methur Chaudhary, coordinator of the struggle committee. The border closure has greatly affected all districts of the province. The tourism sector in Janakpur has taken a hit, as the majority of its tourists were from India.“The hotels in Janakpur used to be fully occupied by Indian tourists during the Ram Janaki Bibaha Mahotsab. But this year, there are no guests in the hotels of Janakpur due to the border closure,” said Abhisek Jhunjhunwala, a hotel entrepreneur in Janakpur. According to him, around 80 percent of the tourists that Janakpur receives are from India.This year’s Ram Janaki Bibaha Mahotsab did not have much fanfare. None of the sages arrived in Janakpur from Aayodhya due to Covid-19 restrictions. “There's also a problem in managing daily essentials and receiving medical treatment due to the border closure. We are not getting any tourists from India and our married daughters are facing trouble travelling to-and-fro their houses in both the countries,” Jhunjhunwala said. Meanwhile in Birgunj, Parsa, the border points have not officially opened yet but people from both Nepal and India are crossing the border through the Birgunj-Raxaul border point. Sometimes, security personnel deployed in the border point prohibit people from using the main road. In such a situation, local residents of Birgunj use the eastern side of the road from Birgunj Customs to reach Raxaul in India. In Saptari, smuggling and theft cases are on the rise despite the border being closed since March. “The border has been closed to the public but smugglers are continuing to operate in collusion with security personnel,” said Shekhar Kumar Singh, a member of the National Assembly. Meanwhile, Shankhar Hari Adhikari, chief district officer of Saptari, said that the border has been closed in accordance with the decision of the federal government and that it would remain closed until the government says otherwise.

Mahatab Alam remanded in judicial custody in connection with Rautahat killings,"The Rautahat District Court has remanded Mahatab Alam, a suspect of the Rautahat brick kiln killings in which at least two persons were allegedly burnt alive and many others were injured 13 years ago, in judicial custody.A single bench of Judge Maniram Neupane on Sunday gave its verdict to send Mahatab to judicial custody stating that the suspect does not seem innocent based on the evidence available.Mahatab is the younger brother of Nepali Congress leader Mohammad Aftab Alam who was arrested by police in October 2019 for his involvement in the Rautahat killing. Security personnel, in coordination with the Indian police, had detained Mahatab from Motihari in the Indian state of Bihar and brought him to Rautahat last week. Mahatab had gone into hiding after the arrest of his brother in 2019. Security personnel took Mahatab under control while he was meeting his son in Motihari.“Following the court’s ruling, Mahatab was sent to the district prison in Gaur on Sunday,” said DIG Dhiraj Pratap Singh, chief at the Provincial Police Office in Janakpur. The charges of attempted murder and holding and transporting explosive materials have been registered against 11 people involved in the Rautahat brick kiln killing. Police claimed that the Alam brothers were the masterminds behind the incident. In 2008, a day before the elections of the Constituent Assembly-I, a blast took place at a shed in Rajpur Municipality, Rautahat. A charge sheet was then filed against Alam and his men for allegedly throwing Trilok Pratap Singh and Osi Akhtar into the kiln’s furnace after the blast. The suspects were charged with burning injured people alive in the brick kiln to destroy evidence.Following the incident, Trilok’s father Shrinarayan Singh and Akhtar’s mother Roksana Khatun had filed complaints against Alam and his accomplices. Alam and three others had been arrested a few months after the explosion but they were later released. An unidentified group gunned down Khatun in 2011.Former minister Alam, who was elected to the federal parliament from Rautahat-2 in the 2017 elections, is in judicial custody in Nakkhu jail.

Six people arrested in connection with ‘honour killing’ of 17-year-old in Rautahat,"Six people have been arrested in connection with the murder of a 17-year-old girl in Rautahat. Among the arrested are the victim's father and mother.According to the police, the murder of the girl is a case of “honour” killing. Police said their investigation has shown that the victim's father had paid some henchmen money to kill his 17-year-old daughter in fear of losing the ‘family's honour’, as his divorced daughter was in a relationship with another man in the village. According to District Police Office Chief SP Siddhi Bikram Shah, preliminary investigation has shown that the family members had orchestrated a plan to kill the 17-year-old in order to save the family's honour. ""As per the investigation, the victim's parents paid off some people to kill their daughter,"" said Shah. ""They feared losing the family's ‘honour’ if the girl eloped with her lover."" The victim was living with her parents after divorcing her husband. She was allegedly married-off to a man from Sarlahi last year, despite the family knowing about her three-year-long relationship with another person from the same village. However, the girl's parents did not approve of her relationship.The police further informed that the parents had paid Rs150,000 to a henchman to kill their daughter on October 25. The plan was to kill her while taking her to India on the pretext of medical treatment. However, they failed to carry out the plan that day.The 17-year-old's parents then found another henchman from Dewahi-Gonahi Municipality and paid him Rs100,000 to commit the crime on November 11, according to police. On the day of the incident, the victim was sleeping with her mother. The henchmen entered the room when the mother was in the bathroom and shot the victim in the head. Shah further said that the arrested individuals have confessed to the crime, adding that the police are continuing their murder investigation after extending the custody of the arrestees from the district court.","Published at : November 30, 2020",Rautahat,Shiva Puri
Protest continues in Bardibas against rape and murder of six-year-old girl,"The highway town of Bardibas in Mahottari district remained tense for the third day as demonstrators descended on the East-West Highway to protest the rape and murder of a six-year-old girl. The highway traffic was obstructed from noon due to the obstructions caused by the demonstrators, who have been demanding a stern punishment for the perpetrator. The body of the six-year-old was found stuffed in a sack on Monday, a day after she was reported missing. She had been allegedly raped and subsequently murdered by her neighbour, a man whom police have identified as Arun Sah.

The meeting had agreed, among others, to offer compensation to the child’s family and launch a fair inquiry into the incident.The people at Thursday’s protest said they were not content with the agreement. A protester’s death in Tuesday’s clash has further stoked their anger and they want justice for the deceased man as well. Three protesters had sustained critical injuries when security personnel opened fire at the demonstration on Tuesday. One of them died while undergoing treatment at a hospital in Kathmandu that same night. On Wednesday, protesters staged demonstrations demanding martyrdom for the deceased man and compensation for his family and the two other injured protesters. Bardibas Municipality on Thursday organised a press meet and assured compensation to the families of the protesters who were killed and injured in Tuesday’s clash. Bidur Kumar Karki, mayor of the municipality, said, “We have requested the government to declare the deceased man a martyr and to provide compensation to his family and to the families of the two injured persons We have also requested for judicial investigation in the girl’s rape and murder case.” Karki also requested all stakeholders and protesters to exercise calm and restraint while the authorities investigate the case.Meanwhile, the United Nations in Nepal has condemned the rape and murder of the child.

Six-year-old missing girl found dead; rape and subsequent murder suspected,"Three persons sustained critical injuries when security personnel opened fire at demonstrators protesting the abduction and murder of a six-year-old girl in Bardibas, Mahottari, on Tuesday. The preliminary investigation showed that the minor was raped and subsequently murdered, police said.Buddi Raj Neupane of Bardibas Municipality-1 and Shyam Karki of Bardibas-5 sustained bullet injuries in the skirmish. The critically injured duo, according to ward chairman of Bardibas-1 Chudamani Pokharel, were airlifted to Kathmandu for treatment. Another man, whose identity is yet to be ascertained, was also injured after police thrashed him with a baton. He is receiving treatment at the local health facility.The six-year-old girl—daughter of Sahid Ansari, a resident of Bardibas Municipality Ward No 14—had gone missing since Sunday evening. Her body wrapped in a sack was recovered near her residence on Monday night. The victim’s family claim the minor was kidnapped, raped and murdered. According to Rajan Chapagain, the deputy superintendent of police at the Area Police Office in Bardibas, the body was sent to the provincial hospital in Janakpur for postmortem.Police arrested 25-year-old Arun Kumar Sah, the victim’s neighbour, for his alleged involvement in the minor’s death. Chapagain said the suspect confessed to his crime of murdering the girl but has not confessed to having raped her. Detailed investigation into the case is underway, he added.According to the family, the victim had gone to Sah’s general store in the neighbourhood with her younger sister to buy chocolates. Both the sisters returned home. But the victim went back to the shop since Sah had allegedly lured her with the promise of more chocolates.Preliminary police investigation showed that Sah raped the minor and murdered her on Sunday evening. According to the investigation officers, he kept the body in a sack and dumped it near her residence on Monday evening before fleeing to his ancestral home in Gaushala Municipality Ward No 5, Mahottari.Sah’s father Raj Kishwor reached the Area Police Office in Gaushala on Monday night, urging the police to arrest his son after the latter allegedly confessed to him about murdering the minor. “We detained the suspect and handed him over to the Area Police Office in Bardibas for investigation,” said Prakash Regmi, inspector at the Area Police Office in Gaushala.The deceased’s relatives and the locals took to the streets early Tuesday morning, demanding strong action against the guilty.

They burnt tyres and chanted slogans demanding justice for the victim.The demonstrators also set Sah’s house on fire and prevented a fire engine from dousing the blaze. The three-storey house was destroyed in the inferno.A clash soon erupted as the security personnel used force to disperse the protesters and resume vehicular movement. Police also lobbed 22 tear gas canisters to take the situation under control. Chapagain said the security personnel were compelled to fire shots, as they could not contain the situation by lobbying tear gas and resorting to baton charge.The security personnel of Nepal Police and Armed Police Force have been mobilised in the area to avert any untoward incident. The situation is under control now, said police.Police claimed that Sah was accused of other criminal charges as well. The Mahottari District Court had released him on bail a month ago. He had been arrested on charges of killing Dilip Thakur of Gaushala-4 some seven months ago. The case is pending in court.The people of Bardibas also claimed that Sah had attempted to rape another local girl who had gone to his store to buy juice during the lockdown.

Private hospitals charging exorbitant amounts to Covid-19 patients in Biratnagar,"Forty-five-year-old Naramaya Magar of Katnuwa in Ratuwamai Muncipality Ward No. 10 committed suicide on Monday night. She had tested positive for Covid-19 the same day.According to Magar’s family, she was taken to Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College for treatment after her PCR report came positive. However, the hospital demanded a deposit of Rs 100,000 for her to get admitted at the hospital.“We could not deposit the amount so we took her back home. She committed suicide the same night,” said Sujan Magar, the deceased’s relative.This is just a case that shows how difficult—and expensive—it is for Covid-19 patients to receive treatment in Biratnagar.A week ago, the federal government had announced to discontinue free test and treatment of Covid-19 patients, except for certain groups including the helpless, impoverished and disabled. Since then, private hospitals in Biratnagar have been charging exorbitant amounts to Covid-19 patients.According to locals, private hospitals are demanding a deposit of Rs 100,000 to Rs 300,000 from each Covid-19 patient before starting their treatment. The hospitals charge Rs 5,000 to Rs 25,000 per Covid-19 patient a day, they say.In Biratnagar, three private hospitals—Nobel Medical College, Birat Medical College and Neuro Hospital—are providing treatment to Covid-19 patients. The Biratnagar Metropolitan City committee of Nepali Congress has also spoken out against the private hospitals fleecing Covid-19 patients. The committee recently organised a press meet and requested hospital operators not to charge exorbitant amounts to Covid-19 patients.As per the ceiling fixed by the government, private hospitals cannot charge more than Rs 3,500 to normal patients, Rs 7,000 to patients with moderate ailments and Rs 15,000 for critical care services a day.Nobel Medical College charges Rs 5,000 per day for patients in general ward, Rs 15,000 per day for patients in ICU facility without ventilator facilities and Rs 18,000 to patients in ICU with ventilator facility. The hospital also demands Rs 100,000 deposit from each Covid-19 patient before taking admission. However, Narayan Dahal, manager at the hospital, said, “We are only taking deposits that equals the charge of a day. We are not taking Rs 100,000 from a Covid-19 patient.” Currently, there are 85 Covid-19 patients in the hospital. According to Dahal, 37 patients are in the general ward, nine are in the ICU with a ventilator facility and the remaining others are in the ICU facility.Likewise, Birat Medical College has been demanding a deposit of Rs 300,000 from each Covid-19 patient in the ICU with charges ranging from Rs 25,000 per day for ventilator service and Rs 15,000 without it. According to the hospital sources, the health facility takes Rs 100,000 deposit and Rs 8,000 per day from those staying in the general bed. Currently, there are 65 Covid-19 patients in the hospital. Among them, 18 are in the ICU facility.Neuro Hospital in Biratnagar also takes Rs 100,000 deposit and a daily charge of Rs 15,000 if a Covid-19 patient has to be admitted to the ICU facility. For those in the general ward, the deposit cost is Rs 50,000. Currently, there are 24 Covid-19 patients in the hospital. Meanwhile, Chief District Officer in Morang Kosh Hari Niraula said, “We have formed an inspection committee led by the commerce office and started inspecting the hospitals from Friday after receiving complaints from all quarters. The inspection committee will submit a report to the local administration soon. We will take action as per the evaluation made by the committee’s report.”","Published at : November 1, 2020",Biratnagar,Binod Bhandari
Police seize 23kg gold from Birgunj apartment,"Police seized a huge amount of smuggled gold and silver from an apartment in Birgunj Metropolitan City-5 on Saturday.Acting on a tip-off, security personnel raided a flat in Reshamkothi and seized 23.275 kg gold and 2.262 kg silver, according to Superintendent of Police Ganga Panta.According to the security unit of the apartment, the flat belongs to Ashok Sinha, an Indian national from Eastern Champaran in Bihar.

Victims of crimes continue to be at the receiving end of panchayat justice,"On September 14, a 17-year-old girl of Dakneshwori Municipality-7, Saptari was found dead in her house. She had allegedly killed herself. Earlier in the day, she had been raped by four men. She was called to a panchayat meeting of village elders and was asked to ""settle the matter"" outside the court of law and not to report the incident to police. For this she would be given Rs 55,000 as compensation.Also in September, in Bishnupur Rural Municipality, Siraha, a 16-year-old was raped and a panchayat held. The panchayat head Jagbir Yadav, former ward-6 chairman of the rural municipality, called for a meeting after the victim and the accused were allegedly “caught in the act” on September 28. The meeting was held on October 3 and the Panchayat members prepared a document stating that the accused would pay Rs 1 million to the victim. The victim’s family refused and a scuffle broke out.The victim's mother, Anju Devi, then filed a complaint at the District Police Office, following which members of the panchayat who were involved in covering up the crime were arrested along with the accused. “We have arrested all those involved and have registered a case for trying to cover up a rape case,” said DSP Shaligram Sharma, the district police spokesperson.Officials from Province 2 said the existence of the panchayat system even to this day and their involvement in settling criminal cases showcase the strong presence of patriarchy in society. Anju Devi and her daughter have left their home since and are currently living at her maternal home in Thalaha, fearing for their safety in Bishnupur.In villages of Province 2, local representatives who have been elected to or have held public offices have been found to take an active part in panchayats. Anita Devkota, a women’s rights activist based in Saptari, says the police too encourage the practice. “Before the pandemic, the District Police Office would be crowded with people attending panchayat hearings,” she said. Even when victims avoid panchayats and go to the police, they are advised a “settlement” rather than following the legal procedure, says Devkota. “This is also a manifestation of how the culture of impunity has got systematic acceptance in the society,” said Deependra Jha, chief attorney in the province. “The middlemen, who see crime as an opportunity to make money, have been promoting such activities.”A panchayat meet is called in order to resolve societal disputes between the members of the society. In most of the cases, the victim and the perpetrator call in influential local people from various walks of life to resolve the issue and to decide on the penalty for the guilty. These influential people or the ""panchas"" are affiliated with various political parties or are social workers, business people, and village elders, among others. Shanti Devi Seth of Bedhewa in Tirhut Rural Municipality was physically assaulted by her neighbours, a father-son duo, in the second week of August. The 70-year-old had registered a complaint at the District Police Office. The police asked the elderly victim to settle the matter at the Panchayat meeting at Lohjara Police Beat. “I went to the District Police Office to file a complaint against my assaulters but since they are influential people, the police sent me back without taking my complaint. They asked me to settle the matter at the local police office,” said Seth. “I know the panchayat and the local police will not take action against those men.”According to Devkota, most victims come to her with similar complaints of being pressured by the police to settle the matter through panchayat.However, Deputy Superintendent Tilak Bharati of Saptari Police refuted such claims. “We seek legal procedure to solve cases of serious nature, especially of gender-based violence. Only some minor cases such as theft and boundary disputes among neighbours are solved through the panchayats and that too when the victims themselves approach the panchayat.""Baburam Dahal, a civil society member in Province 2, says some victims choose to seek justice through panchayats to avoid legal hassles. “In some cases, victims go to panchayats because the legal procedure is long drawn out and costly. When a case reaches the court, the victims face many hassles,” Dahal said. “For victims, justice delayed is justice denied.” SP Rajendra Prasad Dhamala of the Saptari District Police Office says police have been carrying out community outreach programmes through various area police offices to acquaint the locals with the legal procedures.“We are also encouraging them to seek help from the local judicial committees on matters that don’t carry serious criminal charges,” he said.In case the police fail to register a case, the victim can always file a case through the Office of the Government Attorney or at the High Court, as per the Criminal Procedure Code, according to lawyers.In Rautahat too, political leaders and elected representatives are found to be holding panchayats for crimes of serious nature. DSP Bharat Shrestha, the spokesperson of Rautahat police, recalls a case from 2018 wherein Abdul Kalam Azad, a Province 2 assembly member, was accused of holding a panchayat meet for an out-of-court settlement in a rape case involving a 12-year-old in the district. The victim’s family then filed a complaint with the Area Police Office in Garuda. Police arrested 50-year-old Sahamad Ansari for committing the crime; he is serving a jail term following a court order. “Since then, panchayats had stopped intervening in such matters but the last six month has seen a rise in such instances. Panchayats have again started hearing rape and violence against women cases in villages in Rautahat,"" said Shrestha.Indra Dev Yadav, Chief District Officer of Rautahat, says the upper hand village councils have over legal matters in villages has already begun showing adverse effects on society.""Trying to find a solution to every case through panchayat demoralises the victim and boosts the morale of the perpetrators,"" said Yadav. “This is not a good practice. There are legal systems in place and they must be followed by everyone.” According to the data from Women, Children and Senior Citizen Service Directorate, a division of Nepal Police, in Rautahat, many cases of domestic violence have been resolved through panchayats. Last year, 413 cases of violence were registered at the directorate, of which 110 were resolved through panchayats.Historian Dr Pitambar Lal Yadav says that the tradition of holding a panchayat began with the formation of groups to resolve societal disputes. However, they have increasingly begun hearing cases outside their jurisdiction. “In the early days, Panchayat members wouldn’t take sides. Rather, they would listen to the matters on the basis of facts, justice and merits,” said Yadav. “However, most panchayat meets these days are giving verdicts based on political affiliations and in favour of the people from a certain group.” Govind Bandi, a human rights lawyer, said there are criminal laws in Nepal that authorise local units and police to mediate between the disputing parties in minor criminal offences such as theft and family feuds.“There is also a provision for court-sponsored mediation,” said Bandi, “However, cases of serious nature like rape, battery and abetment to suicide cannot be settled outside of the court and respective agencies must carry out their duties.”Jha said the failure of maintaining rule of law is the main reason such criminal practices still thrive in society. “Fair investigation of the crimes like rape and assurance of justice to the victims as dictated by law could discourage such illegal activities.”Shiva Puri in Rautahat and Bharat Jarghamagar in Siraha contributed reporting.","Published at : October 11, 2020",Saptari,Abdhesh Kumar Jha
Father of Dalit youth who died in police custody claims he was forced to change complaint at the behest of a local leader,"Panilal Mahara, the father of 19-year-old Bijay Mahara who died on August 26 after allegedly being tortured in police custody, has said that he was forced to change his statement and was made to accept his son’s body against his wishes.In an interaction programme organised at Chandrapur by Dalit leaders on Wednesday, Panilal claimed that a local leader named Sheikh Karimullaha had told him he would be provided with Rs 2 million compensation and that his son would be declared a martyr if he changed his statement. “Karimullaha had sent me to Kathmandu assuring me Rs 2 million as compensation. He said my son would be declared a martyr,” said Panilal. “He then asked me to go to Kathmandu and receive my son’s body. But my family has not received the amount nor has my son been declared a martyr. I made a mistake because I was thinking about my family and how much the money would help us.” According to Panilal, who is in his late forties and is a resident of Garuda Municipality Ward No. 8, he was taken to Kathmandu in an ambulance in September second week. “I went to Kathmandu with two of my neighbours and a relative and signed the papers. I was asked to sign them in the presence of four police officers and since I can’t read and write, I didn’t know the contents of that letter,” he said. Bijay and six others had been arrested on August 19 in connection to the murder of Niranjan Ram, a local teenager, in Garuda Municipality. Bijay died on August 26 at National Medical College in Birgunj. His family members have claimed that he was tortured in custody. Meanwhile, police have been saying that Bijay died in the course of treatment for a kidney ailment. However, a video of Bijay, which was taken in hospital prior to his death, shows him saying that he was indeed tortured by plainclothes police and was forced to confess to the August 16 murder of 17-year-old Niranjan.In Kathmandu, Panilal had received Bijay’s body, which was kept at TU Teaching Hospital for postmortem, and performed his final rites at the Pashupati Arya Ghat. Panilal had gone to Kathmandu while Dalit leaders, rights activists and the locals had been staging demonstrations by forming the Niranjan-Bijay Murder Struggle Committee. And a case had been registered at the Office of District Attorney against the then Superintendent of Police at the District Police Office in Rautahat Rabiraj Khadka and five other officers on torture and murder charges.Panilal’s departure to Kathmandu and his agreement to receive Bijay’s body ended the protest programme in Rautahat. Upon his return home, Panilal says he contacted Karimullaha for the amount that was promised to him but his calls went unanswered.  “Panilal, an innocent and uneducated man, has been deceived. He received the body and changed the complaint after being lured with Rs 2 million. The demonstrations demanding justice for Bijaya and Niranjan ended inconclusively,” said Dharmendra Pasawan, a Rautahat-based Dalit leader. “Discussions are underway to plan the next course of action. We will not remain silent.” On September 9, Panilal had filed a complaint at the Office of the District Attorney against SP Khadka, the then DSP Gyan Kumar Mahato, the then Inspector Nabin Kumar Singh, SI Birendra Yadav and two head constables Hiroj Miya Dhuniya and Munna Singh and sought investigation into the alleged torture of Bijay in police custody.Family members and friends of Bijay have claimed that Police Inspector Singh and the head constable duo Singh and Dhuniya had tortured Bijay when he was in the custody of the Area Police Office in Garuda at the instruction of the District Police Office.But the complaint has been changed now. Panilal says that he now knows what the contents of the letter he was made to sign in Kathmandu were. “It was a five-page document. I signed the document without knowing what was in it but now I know,” he said.In the changed complaint sent to the District Police Office through the postal service a few days ago, only inspector Singh and the head constable duo Singh and Dhuniya have been charged. Names of SP Khadka, DSP Mahato and SI Yadav have been removed from the complaint.DSP Bharat Shrestha confirmed receiving another complaint through the post office. According to him, names of SP Khadka, DSP Mahato and SI Yadav have been removed from the complaint signed by Panilal.When asked, Karimullaha denied any wrongdoing. He claimed that he had not promised Panilal anything and was not aware that Panilal had left for Kathmandu upon his instructions. “Panilal came to me and urged me to take initiative for compensation stating that he was ready to settle the case. I have not promised him anything,” said Karimullaha.","Published at : October 8, 2020",Rautahat,Shiva Puri
Health posts in Lahan reeling under shortage of essential medicines,"A health post at Bishanpur in Lahan Municipality Ward No. 18 has been reeling under a shortage of essential medicine, including paracetamol, Jeevan Jal (Oral Rehydration Salts) and iron pills, for the last one month.Lalita Chaudhary, an auxiliary nurse midwife at the health post, said, “The health post receives over two to three dozen patients on a daily basis. We have been unable to distribute medicines to the patients due to the shortage of medicine.”Health offices at the municipality are facing a shortage of medicine, as the ones purchased some three months ago through a tender process did not meet the WHO standard, according to Ram Sundar Yadav, chief at the Health Section of Lahan Municipality. “We haven’t been able to distribute medicines to the health posts on time. But we have started the process to purchase medicines through another vendor for this fiscal year,” Yadav said.Pramod Kumar Das, the in-charge of the health post in Ward No. 18, said patients have stopped visiting the health post of late and have started using self-prescribed medicines. “The number of patients visiting our health post has come down to 15 these days. Some of the regular patients are visiting the pharmacy and are self-medicating,” Das said. Julo Pandit, a resident of Bhadaiya, went to Bishanpur Health Post seeking treatment for rashes but was unable to get medicine there. “What is the point of having the health post here if there are no medicines?” she said. The health post at Ward No. 15 in Lahan has also run out of medicine. “We have run out of paracetamol and Jeevan Jal,” said Ram Sundar Chaudary, in-charge at the health post. Twelve health posts and one city health clinic in all 24 wards of the municipality have been reeling under the shortage of essential medicine for the last month. The government provides over 70 types of essential medicines free of cost to patients seeking health care services at district hospitals with 25-bed capacity across the country. Patients can get over 40 types of essential medicines for free in primary health care centres and 35 types of medicines in health posts throughout the country. Das, the in-charge at the Health Post in Ward No. 18, said, “The health receives 36 to 58 types of medicines from the municipality. However, in the last few months, we were receiving only 20 to 22 types of medicines. But the supply has stopped since last month.”According to him, health workers have been facing problems from service seekers due to the shortage of medicines. “The situation has worsened after the start of the nationwide lockdown in March. Amid many difficulties, we have not stopped our services. The health post has been treating patients on a daily basis. But we haven’t been able to give them free medication.”Khemnanda Bhusal, chief administrative officer of Lahan Municipality, says the situation has arised due to the weakness of the municipality’s health section. “The medicine that we purchased a few months ago did not meet the standard of the WHO. The health section should have vetted the company properly before buying from them,” Bhusal said. “I have instructed the health section to start the process of purchasing medicines immediately. The problem will be solved within two to four days.”","Published at : October 6, 2020",Siraha,Bharat Jargamagar
Police arrest another suspect of Rautahat brick kiln massacre,"Police have arrested a suspect of the Rautahat brick kiln massacre in which at least two persons were allegedly burnt alive and many others were injured 13 years ago.Badri Sahani, a resident of Simraungadh Municipality-4 in Bara district, was arrested from Bankul in Rautahat near the Nepal-India border on Friday evening. Preparations are underway to present him before the Rautahat District Court on Sunday, said police.“Sahani, 55, went into hiding after the bomb blast in Fradahawa, Rajpur, in 2008. A team from the Provincial Police Office in Janakpur detained him from Baudhimai Municipality-7. Search is on to arrest seven other suspects of the massacre,” said Deputy Inspector General Dhiraj Pratap Singh, head of the provincial police. Acting on a tip-off, police arrested Sahani as he entered Nepal from India, according to Singh.Issuing a press release on Saturday, Province 2 Provincial Police Office said Sahani is one of 11 suspects involved in the incident in which two to three people were killed and 15-16 injured. According to DIG Singh, it was earlier suspected that many people were killed in the incident but only two deaths have been confirmed so far. Police had arrested Nepali Congress leader Mohammad Aftab Alam in October 2019 for his involvement in the blast. The charges of attempted murder and holding and transporting explosive materials have been registered against 11 people involved in the Rautahat brick kiln massacre. The suspects also face the charges of burning injured people alive in a brick kiln to destroy evidence. Alam, who was elected to the federal parliament from Rautahat-2 in the 2017 elections, is in judicial custody in Nakkhu jail.According to police, Sahani was the head technician at the kiln when the incident took place. He was accused of burning people that were killed and injured in the blast as per the instruction of Alam. DIG Singh said that Sahani has admitted to his involvement in the crime.Besides Alam, police have also arrested two other suspects of the incident. Sheikh Seraj and Mukti Sah were arrested by police a few months ago. Seraj has been taken in custody while the court released Sah on bail.The 2008 blast took place in the shed belonging to Sheikh Idris, Alam’s uncle, on the previous day of the elections of Constituent Assembly-I. Police had filed a charge sheet claiming that Alam and his men had thrown Trilok Pratap Singh and Osi Akhtar into the kiln’s furnace after the blast.Trilok’s father Shrinarayan Singh and Akhtar’s mother Roksana Khatun had lodged complaints against Alam and his accomplices after the explosion. Alam and three others had been arrested a few months after the explosion but they were released later. An unidentified group gunned down Khatun in 2011.The story has been updated to add the fourth paragraph.","Published at : October 4, 2020",Rautahat,Shiva Puri
Illegal construction aggregate mining business thrives in Mahottari,"On July 19, a 16-year-old boy drowned in a sandpit dug for sand mining in Ratu river in Bardibas Municipality, Mahottari. The locals, who claimed that the sandpit was dug without securing a permit from the local government, have been calling on the authorities concerned to regulate extraction of riverbed materials to prevent such incidents. No steps have been taken as of yet to stop illegal mining of sand and stones in local rivers. “We cannot confront the people involved in the extraction of sand and stones. They are dangerous people,” said a local man. “Crusher operators extract riverbed materials in broad daylight and no one’s stopping them.” The man from Bardibas-14, who did not want to reveal his identity due to security concerns, claimed that there are more than 100 sandpits, each of them 20 to 30 feet deep, along the banks of Ratu river alone. “These crusher plants are being run within a 500-metre distance from the river which has been prohibited by the law,” he said.Local people say illegal construction aggregate mining has gained momentum in the recent months. Phauda Singh Syangba, a local land rights activist, said: “The situation has gone out of control. Crusher operators do not obey rules and regulations. They have been emboldened by the authorities' silence.”“Sometimes locals take control over the vehicles used in illegal excavation and hand them over to the monitoring agencies,” said Syangba. “But the concerned authorities let off the perpetrators after levying a small fine.” According to the prevalent rules and regulations, the local governments as well as the district administration office have the authority to intervene and take action against illegal mining businesses. Neither of these authorities has done anything to shut down illegal crusher plants so far. Suresh Prasad Singh, chief at the District Coordination Committee in Mahottari, said, that the committee was planning to completely ban mining activities on local rivers for sand and stones. “The law states that crusher plants cannot operate within 500 meters from the water body. But we have received reports from many locals that many crusher plants are brazenly violating the law and running their operation illegally,” he said.Several notices issued by the committee to the local crusher operators, directing them to follow the regulations, have gone unheeded, Singh added. “If they refuse to operate according to the rules and regulations, we will shut them down.” The regulations clearly state that crusher plants should be at least 500 metres away from highways and rivers, 100 meters away from high-tension electricity grids and 2km away from schools and colleges, health centres and hospitals, security installations, human settlement, and religious and archaeological sites.The majority of crusher plants in Mahottari are not adhering to these regulations.Syangba, the land rights activist, said local governments have largely failed to take action against illegal crusher plants because some people’s representatives themselves are offering patronage to their operators. “The operators offer handsome money or even use force to prevent people from making noise about their illegal activities. We have found that people’s representatives and crusher operators have an equal share in the illegal business,” said Syangba. Bidur Karki, mayor of Bardibas Municipality, denies that the local government is working in collusion with the crusher operators. “The crusher operators are using my name for their own benefit,” he said. “I will take strong action against illegal crusher operators in the Ratu river. I seek the locals’ support to stop the illegal mining of sand and stones.” The local crusher plant operators that the Post contacted refused to comment on the matter. Meanwhile, an inspection committee of the District Coordination Committee on Thursday took action against 12 vehicles (six tipper trucks and six tractors) for illegal excavation in Ratu river. “We have sent the vehicles loaded with sand and stones to the Area Police Office for further investigation. The police will conduct an investigation in coordination with the municipality,” said Singh, the committee chief.Deputy Superintendent of Police Rajan Chapagain at the Area Police Office in Bardibas, said: “The seized vehicles did not have necessary documents to transport the riverbed materials. We are looking into their business and the crusher operators involved.”In Mahottari, there are more than 70 crusher plants operating on the banks of a half dozen rivers and rivulets in Bhangaha, Gaushala and Bardibas among other local units.","Published at : October 7, 2020",Mahottari,Sunita Baral
Province 2 government authorises provincial Public Service Commission to hire employees,"The Province 2 government has authorised the provincial Public Service Commission to initiate the employee appointment process.The Cabinet meeting held on Monday decided to give authority to the provincial commission for the appointment of employees under technical services—health and engineering.Though the provincial Public Service Commission was formed a year ago on September 8, 2019, it has remained out of function due to a lack of necessary laws. As per the country’s constitution, the provincial commission can hire officials in the province only after the formulation of the provincial Civil Service Act. But since the federal government is yet to endorse the Federal Civil Service Act, the provincial Civil Service Act remains to be formulated. Constitutionally, the provincial act is to be enacted as per the spirit of the federal act.The provincial government said it chose to initiate the employee hiring process, as development works in the province have hit a snag and public services were affected due to a workforce shortage. “People have been deprived of services due to the shortage of employees in the health and engineering sectors. The province is in dire need of employees. The shortage has affected day-to-day administrative work too,” said Gyanendra Yadav, provincial minister for Internal Affairs and Law. He is also the spokesperson of the provincial executive.“The provincial Civil Service Act is stuck in the Provincial Assembly since the federal government has yet to endorse the Federal Civil Service Act. The provincial government gave the nod to the provincial Public Service Commission to appoint technical employees, as it’s highly unlikely that the centre will endorse the necessary laws anytime soon,” said Yadav. The commission has been authorised to appoint officials up to the seventh level in health and engineering services in accordance with the existing Civil Service Act 1993. The Cabinet meeting also decided to post 25 employees at the commission immediately since it has only four employees. Birendra Yadav, secretary at the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Law, has been given the responsibility as the secretary of the provincial Public Service Commission.The Province 2 government is led by Samajbadi Party Nepal leader Lalbabu Raut. The provincial government claims that it has repeatedly informed the federal government about the need of employees in the province. “The provincial government had to initiate the employee hiring process since the federal government has failed to take our problems into consideration,” said a government source.Gangesh Gunjan Jha, the spokesperson at the commission, said the body will now proceed with the hiring process. “We will coordinate with the central Public Service Commission to prepare an application form to conduct the examinations,” said Jha.","Published at : September 29, 2020",Dhanusha,Santosh Singh
Construction of railway tracks delayed due to forest clearance issue,"The construction work of the Mechi-Mahakali Railway along the Bagmati-Dhansar section in Rautahat is yet to start for a lack of clearance from the federal Ministry of Forests and Environment. The laying of tracks was supposed to start about a year ago, according to the Department of Railways.The Department of Railways wrote to the forest ministry some 10 months ago seeking permission to cut down trees of the national forest to construct the railway track. The track construction work has been halted, as the ministry is yet to give permission to the department to cut down trees.“The ministry has not responded to the railway department’s request. The construction work will be put on hold until we receive the ministry’s response,” said Sumit Pokharel, an engineer at the department.According to Pokharel, the Department of Railways will use around 40.49 hectares of land of the national forest while constructing the railway track along the 17.8 km long Bagmati-Dhansar section in Rautahat district. “We sent a file to the forest ministry on November 14, 2019, seeking permission to fell down 5,297 trees in the national forest. But the file is stuck in the ministry,” said Pokharel.Binod Singh, chief at the Division Forest Office in Chandranigahapur, said that his office has not received any direction from the ministry about forest clearance for the construction of the railway track. “The ministry has not sent us any files or correspondence in regards to the use of the forest area for the railway project,” he said.The construction work of the track along the Bagmati-Dhansar section was also unable to take off due to the dispute between the locals and the project officials regarding compensation. The locals had been demanding fair compensation for their land since November 2019. The dispute was only resolved in May.When asked about the file sent by the railways department, Hari Prasad Pandey, the information officer at the forest ministry, said he had no knowledge about the issue. Different construction companies were awarded contracts to the railway track by dividing the section into four packages. Lumbini, Apex and Thani JV Construction Company had initiated work at package II some 14 months ago at the cost of Rs 700 million. Around 90 percent work at this package has been completed.However, only 10 percent work of package I and package III has been completed so far. The construction of package IV is yet to begin. The national forest in Rautahat comes under packages I and IV.The construction of all four packages should be completed by January 28, 2022, as per the contract signed with the government.","Published at : September 24, 2020",Rautahat,Shiva Puri
Front line workers at risk of Covid-19 infection despite dip in cases in Parsa,"The number of active Covid-19 cases has decreased in Parsa, a hotspot of the disease in Province 2, but the infection rate among frontline workers mobilised to control Covid-19 in the district is still high.A total of 141 health workers, 49 janitors working at various health institutions and three ambulance drivers have tested positive for coronavirus as of Tuesday. The first case of infection in a health worker was reported back in May, according to the District Administration Office in Parsa. Similarly, 125 security personnel have been infected with the virus in the district.“Many health employees and support staff have been infected with Covid-19 in Parsa despite adopting all safety measures while on duty,” said Jayamod Thakur, an officer at the District Health Office. He, along with his wife and son, tested positive for Covid-19 a few weeks ago. “Despite being very cautious, I caught the virus. There is no sure-fire way to protect ourselves from the virus while on duty.”According to Thakur, the officer at the District Health Office, there are a total of 624 health workers working in various health institutions in the district. “The district health office will be providing health workers with coronavirus insurance. They have been given PPEs and other protective gears while being mobilised to control the disease,” Thakur said. A total of 2,628 people have tested positive for Covid-19 in Parsa district with 45 deaths so far. The health authority has collected and tested swabs of 23,744 people. “The risk of coronavirus transmission is still very high among health workers and other hospital staffers even though the number of active cases has decreased in Parsa,” said Dr Atulesh Chaurasiya, spokesperson of Narayani Hospital in Birgunj. “Health workers and hospital employees cannot refrain from their duties and responsibilities and most of them are getting infected despite health safety measures in place.” Narayani Hospital is one of the designated Covid-19 hospitals in the district.According to health workers, the number of Covid-19 cases had surged in mid-July to mid-August in the district. Although the number of positive cases has decreased, the chances of an outbreak are high, as the district has been slowly relaxing its prohibitory orders. “Although the local administration has relaxed the prohibitory orders, the public should be wary of stepping out of their houses. The infection rate is high in neighbouring Bara and other districts and there is free movement across district borders. This may cause the virus to spread further in Parsa too,” Chaurasiya said. “The number of people dying of Covid-19 is still high in the district even if the number of positive cases has decreased.” Four persons died of Covid-19 in the district on Sunday and Monday, he added.Birgunj is Nepal’s largest trade gateway and handles 70 percent of the country’s imports and exports. The densely populated Parsa has an open border with India, which exposes the district to a surge in infections since movement through the porous border continues despite restrictions in place. “Security personnel are also at high risk of contracting the disease since we have to deal with daily activities in the border area,” said Superintendent of Police Ganga Panta. The district administration has enforced a prohibitory order in Birgunj Metropolitan City till October 1 with certain relaxations. “The prohibitory order could be lifted from October 1 if the number of positive cases continues to decrease,” said Binaya Shreewastav, an administrative officer at the District Administration Office. “However, people should be very careful, as the virus may spread during the festival season when there will be a heavy movement of people within and outside the district.”","Published at : September 24, 2020",Parsa,Shankar Acharya
Police arrest two men accused of raping a 17-year-old in Saptari,"Police have arrested two of the four main accused in the gang rape of a 17-year-old girl, who later took her own life after she was forced into an out-of-court settlement by the village elders.District Police Office, Saptrai Inspector Santosh Khadka informed that the two accused— Suman Kumar Mandal and Ranjit Mandal— were arrested from Nepal-India border area on Thursday.According to police, the two were hiding on the Indian side of the border and were arrested with the help of the Indian police. “The accused were hiding on the Indian side of the border.

Teenage rape victim in Saptari took her own life after being forced into out-of-court settlement,"A teenager rape victim has taken her own life in Saptari after she was forced into an out-of-court settlement by the village elders.The grievous crime was revealed after the 17-year-old girl was found dead at her home in Dakneshwori Municipality-7 on Tuesday morning. Police have since arrested three men for allegedly forcing the girl to not report the crime to the police and settle the case in the community. The four men who raped the girl are still at large.Deputy Superintendent of Police Tilak Bharati said the girl had been brutally raped by the four men on Monday morning and she took her own life that same night because she and her mother were reportedly forced by the Panchayat, a form of village council, to “settle the matter” outside the court of law saying that if the incident became public it would bring shame upon the community. “Jayakanta Mandal, Satya Narayan Mandal and Basudev Mandal, who were in the Panchayat meeting, have been arrested. The four men accused of rape—Dharma Mandal, Bishnu Mandal, Ranjit Mandal and Bablu Mandal—are at large,” Bharati said.Ram Narayan Chaudhary, the ward chairman of Dakneshwori-7, said he did not know about the case until after the girl’s death.“The girl died because the Panchayat decided to hush up the matter before it reached the police. The Panchayat directed the girl and her mother to accept monetary compensation from the perpetrators. This is a heinous crime,” Chaudhary said.The girl had returned home in a semi-conscious state and when her mother sought the help of her neighbours, none came forward, a local man said on condition of anonymity. “At noon, eight to ten panchas (council heads) met the girl and her mother. They threatened them of consequences if they went to the District Police Office to file a complaint against the four men,” he said. Chaudhary, the ward chairman, said: “The Panchayat tried to sort the matter in the village by making the perpetrators pay hush-up money of Rs 50,000 to Rs 55,000.” According to the police, the men in the Panchayat will be charged with abetting suicide and destroying the evidence. The body of the deceased was sent to a Dharan-based hospital for post mortem on Wednesday.“The girl and her mother lived alone working on a farm. Police should take strong action against the perpetrators and deliver justice to the girl and her mother,” Chaudhary said.","Published at : September 17, 2020",Rajbiraj,Abdhesh Kumar Jha
Locals of Musahar settlement in Dhanusha and police clash over timber logging,"On Sunday night, a clash ensued between the police and the locals of Shantipur Dharatol, a Musahar settlement in Bateshwor Rural Municipality Ward No. 5, Dhanusha, over the issue of timber logging. Five security personnel were injured in the clash.The clash arose when police personnel went to the settlement to catch suspects of a timber logging incident. According to the locals, some of them had gone to unearth old sal trees buried over the years along the banks of Aurahi stream. Locals say two plainclothes policemen—Assistant Sub-Inspector Bulendra Giri and constable Prakash Chaudhary—from the Area Police Office in Mahendranagar came to the settlement on Sunday, started harassing villagers for collecting timber logs from the riverbanks and then demanded Rs 2,000 for the logs. They claim the clash erupted when the locals refused to provide the amount.“They asked for Rs 2,000 but none of us had any money so we couldn’t pay them” said Thakini Sada, an elderly woman at the settlement. “Now the policemen are interrogating villagers, trying to frame them. A majority of men and youths have already left the village in fear of being arrested."" Shivakaran Yadav, the chairman of Ward No. 5 of Bateshwor Rural Municipality, says that Musahars living in the area dig out buried sal wood every rainy season when floods erode the embankments. Some Musahar youths from Shantipur Dharatol, who had returned to the villages after losing their jobs in Janakpur and other market places due to the pandemic, laboured for two weeks to retrieve eight logs from the riverbanks. They were planning to sell the logs at Rs 60,000.“We were planning to sell the logs to buy some food and other essentials. Most of us in the settlement are daily wage earners and since there is no work now, it’s very difficult to get by,” said 70-year-old Tara Devi Sada. “My husband left home on Sunday when the police came. The police arrested my daughter-in-law for allegedly being involved in the clash.”All 20 households in the settlement have been without jobs for the past five months due to the prohibitory orders imposed by authorities to contain Covid-19. The police, however, denied the allegations. Sub-Inspector Mohammad Mustafa said that the villagers' claim that the police demanded money from them was baseless. The investigation on timber collection from the riverbanks is underway, he added.According to Mustafa, Musahar youths retaliated against two police personnel in plain clothes when the latter attempted to seize the collected timber logs. Police Inspector Dipak Kumar Raya and constable Ram Biswas Pandit sustained serious injuries in the clash while three other security personnel were mildly injured. According to Deputy Superintendent of Police Makendra Mishra, five villagers have been arrested for investigation. Police have held Rajiya Sada, Anje Sada, Nirajan Raut, Rajita Raut and Phulgen Sada for their involvement in the clash. The Dhanusha District Court on Wednesday remanded the suspects in custody for investigation. Police filed attempted murder charge against the three men while the two women were charged for indecent behaviour.The police have also seized the collected timber logs and informed the Division Forest Office in Dhanusha.","Published at : September 11, 2020",Dhanusha,Santosh Singh
Complaint filed against six police personnel for in-custody torture and death of Dalit youth,"A complaint has been filed at the Office of the District Attorney against six police personnel, including Superintendent of Police Rabiraj Khadka, for the alleged in-custody torture and death of 19-year-old Bijay Mahara.On Wednesday, Panilal Mahara, Bijay’s father, filed the complaint against SP Khadka, the then chief at the District Police Office in Rautahat, the then DSP Gyan Kumar Mahato, the then Inspector Nabin Kumar Singh, SI Birendra Yadav, and two head constables Hiroj Miya Dhuniya and Munna Singh and has sought investigation into the alleged torture of Bijay in police custody. Subash Kumar Bhattarai, the district attorney, said, “A complaint has been filed at the Office of the District Attorney. We have directed the District Police Office to take the necessary action.” Bijay and six others were arrested on August 16 in connection to the murder of Niranjan Ram, a local teenager, in Garuda Municipality. Bijay died on August 26 at the National Medical College in Birgunj. His family members have claimed that he was tortured in custody and have refused to receive his body, which was sent to Kathmandu for a post-mortem two weeks ago.The police, however, claim that Bijay died in the course of treatment for a kidney ailment.A video of Bijay, which was taken in a hospital prior to his death, shows him saying that he was indeed tortured by plainclothed police and was forced to confess to the August 15 murder of 17-year-old Niranjan.After the incident, SP Khadka was called back to the Police Headquarters in Kathmandu. SP Siddhi Bikram Shah has replaced Khadka in the District Police Office in Rautahat.DSP Mahato, who was the chief at the Area Police Office in Garuda when the incident occurred, has also been called back to the Province 2 Police Office in Janakpur.

Local governments in Province 2 lag behind in annual budget presentation,"Chhinnamasta Rural Municipality of Saptari, has failed to present its annual budget in time for three years in a row while 50 local governments across the country are yet to present their budget for current fiscal year 2010-21.As per the Intergovernmental Fiscal Arrangement Act, all local governments should present their fiscal budgets by June 25.But, according to Surya Narayan Mandal, chairperson of Chhinnamasta, the rural municipality failed to call the village assembly to present the budget, as the chief administrative officer has not reported to work since mid-July due to family reasons as well as the Covid-19 travel restrictions.“He will attend the office in one or two days and we will make necessary preparations for holding the village assembly,” Mandal said. In the last fiscal 2019-20, Chhinnamasta Rural Municipality had presented the budget late. In the previous fiscal 2018-19, it had presented the budget in April 2019, nine months after the fiscal year began, as the elected local representatives could not agree on the budget share at the ward level.According to the Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration, most local governments that failed to present a budget for the current fiscal year so far are from Province 2. Of the total 50 local governments that have failed to present their budget this fiscal year, 36 are from Province 2, four each from Province1, Sudurpaschim Province and two from Gandaki Province. This is not the first time that local governments in Province 2 have failed to present their budgets in time. In the previous two fiscal years, many local governments in the province were late while presenting their budgets. While some might argue that the Covid-19 pandemic delayed the budget presentation this year, others could bring up the past records to claim that it was not the pandemic that caused the delay.“Political differences and issue of international management are basically responsible for why some local governments are failing to present the budget in time,” said Jaya Narayan Acharya, national programme director at the Provincial and Local Governance Support Programe, a government programme designed to develop capacity of sub-national governments. “As the budget is not just a fiscal document but a political one too. Differences among political forces could lead to such problems.” One particular factor, according to Acharya, could be the representation of diverse political forces at the local governments in Province 2 compared to the local governments in other provinces. Nepal Communist Party, Nepali Congress and Janata Samajbadi Party—formed after merger of Madhes-centric parties—all have representation at the local level. In other provinces, it is only the Nepal Communist Party and the Nepali Congress that lead the local governments. Last fiscal year, Bhagwanpur Rural Municipality in Siraha had struggled to present its budget for a long time due to a lack of support from the representatives of other political parties. Bechan Prasad Yadav, who was elected from the erstwhile Sanghiya Samajbadi Forum-Nepal (now Janata Samajbadi Party) as a local unit chairperson, had complained about lack of support from representatives of other parties last time. The rural municipality has already presented its budget for this fiscal year.However, Tula Narayan Sah, executive director of the Nepal Madhesh Foundation, a non-governmental organisation advocating for Madhesi issues, does not see the difference among the political parties as the main reason for the delay in budget presentation. “Some local governments have failed to present their budgets even when a single party has a majority in the local assembly,” he said. As per his observation, the lack of awareness among the Madhesi community about the process of the state affairs is one of the key reasons behind consistent delay in presenting a timely budget in Province 2. “This is because for a long time, the Madhesi community didn’t have access to the state and their representatives and they are unaware about the grammar of the state affairs,” Sah said. Most of the local governments in Province 2 that failed to present their budgets are based in the inner parts of the region highly populated by the Madhesi community, according to the federal affairs ministry.“Even after democracy was restored in 1990, the Madhesi community never got real political freedom. They could not criticise the dominant political system. When there is critical civil society, it makes a difference in the process of governance at the local level,” Sah said. “In Madhesh, people of the hill region and Madheshi elites promoted the political culture of patronisation which resulted in the lack of knowledge about state affairs among the Madhesi community.”","Published at : September 10, 2020",Kathmandu,Prithvi Man Shrestha

In the absence of a bridge, around 600 people living in 15 villages in Siraha and Dhanusha have to rely on boats to cross the river even during the rainy season when the water level in the river reaches danger level.A majority of the locals in Siraha Municipality are farmers who cross over to Dhanusha everyday to go to their paddy fields. Sanjaya Yadav and Chhedi Mukhiya, who are in their fifties, are residents of Bansbitta in Ward No. 6 of Siraha Municipality. They are the only two local boatmen in the area and have been rowing their boats across the river since they were young adults. For five months a year, from mid-June to mid-November, they wait for passengers at Bansbittaghat. “Since most of our passengers are farmers, they pay us in paddy. Each farmer who uses our services pays us with 20 kgs of paddy for ferrying them across the river and back for five months,” said Yadav. But the boatmen charge Rs 50 to load a motorcycle onto their boats and Rs 20 for a bicycle. “It’s risky to row our boats in the river during the monsoon but the locals from Siraha have to go to Dhanusha everyday to work in their fields,” said Mukhiya. “Since there is no bridge over the river, we ferry them across the river even during the rainy season.”According to Mukhiya, six individuals have died in boat accidents in the river in the last decade. Meanwhile, the locals of Tetariya, a rural village at Kamala Municipality Ward No. 3 in Dhanusha, frequent Siraha, the district headquarters of Siraha district, to purchase daily essentials. “We go to Siraha every other day to buy essentials since it’s the nearest marketplace from our village,” Indradevi Das, a local woman of Tetariya, told the Post. “We have to pay Rs 50 per person to the boatman to cross the river. They say they will build the bridge but it’s been a decade and the construction is still incomplete.” Since the boats are available only till 5pm, Das says that the locals in her village face difficulties when faced with emergencies. “If we have a medical emergency, we have to take an alternate route to Siraha district headquarters via Jaynagar in India. There are no health facilities in our village,” said Das.According to the Postal Road Project Office in Janakpur, Pappu-Lumbini JV had agreed to construct a 470 metre-long bridge in Bansbittaghat at a total cost of Rs 249.1 million nearly a decade ago. According to the agreement signed on June 14, 2011, the bridge should have been completed on December 15, 2014. But by the end of December 2014, Pappu-Lumbini JV had only managed to complete 30 percent of the work.Since then, the project’s deadline has been extended several times, and yet the bridge is nowhere near complete. Former lawmaker Ram Chandra Jha claimed that Pappu-Lumbini JV is also guilty of altering the original design of the bridge.According to the agreement, the depth of the bridge pillar should be somewhere between 23 and 29 metres; however, the pillars of the under-construction bridge are only 17 metres deep. “Pappu-Lumbini JV has not only violated the deadline but has also altered the design of the project. The company has deceived the government and the people,” he said.However, an official at the Postal Road Project Office said, “The office scrapped the agreement with Pappu after eight years of the contract deadline. Only Lumbini Builders, one half of the JV, has been working on the bridge project since last year.” The bridge project connects the districts of Siraha and Dhanusha with the Postal Highway.","Published at : September 7, 2020",Siraha,Bharat Jarghamagar
Health workers in Birgunj local unit found absent from duty,"On Friday afternoon, an inspection team from Paterwa Sugauli Rural Municipality reached Nichuta Health Post at Ward No.5 following complaints that the clinic was without any health workers. The team led by Bhujendra Yadav, the administrative officer of the local unit, found that the clinic’s auxiliary health worker Uday Sah has been absent from work for the past 15 days without informing the authorities.Health workers need to inform the health section of their respective local units beforehand if they require leave from their job but most health workers in the rural municipality of Parsa, a hotspot of coronavirus in Province 2, are found absent from their duty stations without having informed the local unit.“The monitoring team found that most health workers remained absent from their duty in Nichuta Health Post. A few who did come to work were found not completing their duty hours in the office,"" Bhujendra Yadav, the administrative officer of the local body, told the Post. “We visited all four health posts in the rural municipality on Friday and none of the health workers assigned on duty were present.” According to the attendance register at Sonbarsha Health Post in Ward No. 1, the in-charge of the health post and the auxiliary health worker had not been to work for the past 18 days. ""The health workers are found to be absent at a time when they are expected to be available to provide health services and consultation to the locals,” said Yadav. “We will first ask for a written clarification from the absent health workers. We will then proceed for legal action if their answers are not found satisfactory.” In Gadi Health Post, auxiliary health worker duo Reyaj Ansari and Santosh Chaudhary were found present on paper but they were not at the health facility when the monitoring team reached there at around 11:30am on Friday. According to the locals, Ansari and Chaudhary have been running a private health clinic at Gadi Bazaar. ""They sign the attendance register and leave for their clinic everyday. We have informed the health unit of the rural municipality several times but no action has been taken against them,"" said Sarfudin Ansari of Gadi. As per the record at the Gadi Health Post, of late, around 60 people visit the health facility on a daily basis. ""The patients are deprived of treatment, as the health workers are not present in their duty stations. As a result, we are compelled to get treatment at private clinics,"" said Sarfudin.Locals also complained that the health post takes four months from the delivery time to provide allowances to postpartum mothers.Similarly, the locals of Nichuta also complained of a shortage of medicines for non-communicable diseases like diabetes and blood pressure at the health post. Karna Sah, the in-charge at the health post, admitted to the shortage of medicines at the facility. However, according to Jagannath Sah, the chief at the health unit of the rural municipality, all the health posts were supplied with the medicines as per their demands just a week ago.","Published at : September 7, 2020",Birgunj,Bhusan Yadav
Relief distribution programme in Birgunj fails to cover vulnerable families,"On Thursday, many residents of Ranighat in Birgunj Metropolis reached the District Police Office in Parsa to receive relief after hearing about the police office’s distribution programme through a local FM station. Among them was 50-year-old Nagma Khatun, who had been visiting the office for the past two days in hopes of receiving relief.“We came to the police office after hearing that they were distributing relief,” said Khatun. “We were here on Wednesday too but our turn never came. They asked us to come back on Thursday but after waiting all day long, they turned us away empty-handed.” More than 150 women from Sheerpur, Murli and Chhapaiya in Birgunj queued up outside the police office for two days to receive relief. However, most of them had to return empty-handed after security personnel from the police office asked them to leave. “They told us that it was the metropolis who was supposed to distribute relief,” said Khatun. “But the metropolis is currently not distributing relief so we came here.”The nationwide lockdown that was put in place back in March followed by the protracted prohibitory order imposed by the metropolis for over a month now have left many daily-wage earners and those from the lower-income bracket without a source of income. These families are solely dependent on relief provided by the government to see them through these tough times. Girija Devi, who is in her early 40’s, has a family of four to feed. A resident of Ranighat in Birgunj Metropolis-11, Devi says her family has been robbed of the opportunity to work since the prohibitory order was imposed in the metropolis on July 25 to control the spread of Covid-19. “We are daily wage workers. We cannot work when there are lockdown and prohibitory orders in place,” she said. “It’s becoming increasingly difficult for us to survive.” According to the District Police Office, the relief distribution programme was meant for those in extremely vulnerable situations. The office had collected data of the needy families in the metropolis but on Thursday those whose names were not listed had also reached the police office. “The District Police Office had decided to distribute leftover foodstuff from an earlier distribution drive to around 60 people. The local unit was to provide relief to another 80,” said Superintendent of Police Ganga Panta. “But on Thursday, a large crowd gathered outside the office so we had to send them away.” The women who had reached the police office on Thursday claimed that security personnel resorted to baton charge to disperse the crowd. “They called us to the office but chased us away by using force. This is adding insult to our injury,"" said Tetar Devi Paswan of Chhapkaiya, who had also reached the police office on Thursday. The police, however, deny allegations of using force on the crowd.Meanwhile, in Ward No.19 of the metropolis, food grains meant for 200 impoverished families have been stuck in the storeroom of Bindabasini temple for the last two months. The Province 2 government had sent the relief packages for needy families back in June. Each package comprises 25 kg rice, two kg lentil, one litre cooking oil and one packet salt.The locals blame Santosh Tiwari, the ward chairman who is also the spokesperson at the metropolis, for depriving them of relief materials sent by the provincial government. ""We had repeatedly requested the ward chairman to distribute the relief but he ignored us,"" said Naresh Prasad Gupta, a local. Tiwari, however, claimed that the relief distribution was delayed, as the available relief materials were not enough for every needy family in the ward. “The amount we have with us right now is not sufficient for all needy families. We will bring more stuff and distribute it among the locals in the next few days,” said Tiwari.Hundreds of impoverished families in Birgunj have been left high and dry for almost six months now since the nationwide lockdown was imposed following the coronavirus pandemic.Nasima Khatun of Shreepur used to work as a house help but she hasn’t been able to work amid the pandemic. Her husband, a teacher, has also not received his monthly salary for the past four months. “This pandemic has rendered us both jobless. We have used up most of our savings and if the government does not provide us with food, we will die of hunger soon,” she said. Khatun had also reached the police office on Thursday to receive relief but was sent away since her name was not on the list of needy people prepared by the police office. “I came to the police office hoping to get relief but they chased me away. They said they were giving relief only to those whose names were on the list and that we should go to the metropolis’ office. But the metropolis is not distributing any relief,"" she said. Meanwhile, Chief District Officer of Parsa Asman Tamang said the district administration had started distributing reliefs to impoverished families through the District Police Office and Birgunj Metropolis since the past few days. ""We heard that the relief materials in the police office weren’t enough to cover all needy families. Those who had to leave empty-handed on Thursday will receive relief packages soon,"" he said.","Published at : September 6, 2020",Birgunj,Bhusan Yadav

A police team led by Deputy Superintendent of Police Gyan Kumar Mahato, the then chief at the Area Police Office in Garuda, had then reached the site to collect the body and look for evidence. A team, led by Inspector Kedarman Dong, was formed to investigate the case. The team detained Sheikh Aazad and 10 other locals, including Bijay, on August 16. Four of the suspects were released the next day.On August 18, Superintendent of Police Rabiraj Khadka, the district police chief, deployed Inspector Nabin Singh and the head constable duo Munna Singh and Firoj Alam, to Garuda to investigate the Niranjan murder case. Inspector Dong refused to give details about the incident, nor did he say anything about the Inspector Singh-led team taking over the investigation. ""I am not in the position to reveal the details.

Province 2 has seen highest number of coronavirus-related deaths,"Province 2 has seen the highest number of coronavirus-related deaths in the country, according to the data available at the Social Development Ministry in Janakpur. As many as 85 people have died of Covid-19 in the province as of Sunday. Parsa tops the list with 33 deaths followed by 13 deaths in Bara, 12 in Dhanusha, eight in Mahottari, seven in Siraha, five in Saptari, four in Rautahat and three in Sarlahi.Dr Ramdev Chaudhary, spokesperson at the Provincial Hospital in Janakpur, said the graph of virus-related deaths is high in the province, as most of the patients who died of Covid-19 had pre-existing health conditions like diabetes, heart diseases and kidney ailments. According to him, there are two main reasons behind the high death rate in Province 2—elderly people with other chronic ailments getting infected with the virus and the delay in bringing patients to health institutions.""Three Covid-19 patients who died in an isolation ward in Janakpur in July were above 65 years. The first patient had diabetes while the second and third suffered from high blood pressure and severe paralysis respectively,"" said Chaudhary. Health officials in various hospitals in the province reiterate Chaudhary’s assessment of delay in treatment as one of the causes behind the high death rate among the coronavirus patients.""Most patients we receive at Covid-specific hospitals are already in critical condition,"" said Dr Atulesh Chaurasiya, the spokesperson at Narayani Hospital in Birgunj. “Some of them are brought to the hospital only after their health condition worsens.” On Saturday, three coronavirus patients died in Birgunj. Among them was a 43-year-old man from Birgunj Metropolitan City Ward No 12. The man, who was also suffering from Hepatitis B and HIV, had been brought to Birgunj Health Care Corona Hospital on Friday evening. According to health officials involved in the treatment of coronavirus patients in Birgunj, around 40 to 45 percent of patients died within six hours of being brought to Covid-specific hospitals.As coronavirus cases are spiralling, Province 2 is also fast runnin out of isolation wards. “There are not enough isolation beds, ventilators and oxygen plants in most coronavirus hospitals,"" said Dr Niraj Kumar Singh, a senior physician at Narayani Hospital. Singh also pointed to the lack of public awareness about Covid-19 has also contributed to the high infection and mortality rates in the province. ""Even the patients with pre-existing health ailments have the tendency of seeking medical care only when their conditions deteriorate,"" he added. Of late, people with no travel history to infected areas have also tested positive for the virus. Health officials suspect that the virus has entered the community-level transmission in the province.""Many elderly people have begun testing positive for coronavirus. We suspect that the virus got transmitted to them through their family members,"" said Dr Udaya Narayan Singh, the in-charge of Gandak Corona Hospital in Birgunj.Province 2 is the hotspot of coronavirus infection in the country with the highest number of positive cases. As of Sunday, a total of 10,724 people have been infected with the virus in eight districts of the province.

Perpetrators who shot dead Rautahat temple priest remain at large,"Sriram Sah, a temple priest, was shot dead while having dinner outside the temple in Rautahat district on the night of August 19.It has been nine days since the fatal shooting of the 65-year-old priest at Kherariya Tol in Madhav Narayan Municipality, and police have made no arrest so far. Province 2 police chief Deputy Inspector General Dhiraj Pratap Singh said the police have identified the suspected shooters who are believed to have fled across the border to India after committing the crime. “We believe that the suspects are hiding in bordering Indian towns. We will apprehend them at any cost,” Singh said.The police suspicion that the gunmen might have fled to India amid the coronavirus pandemic, when all cross-border movements have been heavily restricted, has raised a serious question about the security status at the southern border points.DIG Singh said the police will launch a probe to determine the escape route of the perpetrators. “We will take action against the police personnel deployed at the border points if they are found to have been lax during their duty hours,” said Singh. In view of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and the ban on border crossing, security agencies have heightened the security along the boundary areas between Nepal and India by setting up additional border outposts. But despite the heavy presence of security personnel along the border areas, there have been no let up in cross-border movement of people, contrabands and sometimes criminals. Police say as Nepal and India share an open and largely unregulated border, smugglers and criminals could easily move between the two countries. They suspect that the people who shot dead Sah might have got across using the route with least police presence. In the wake of the incident, various rights organisations have demanded a proper investigation into Sah’s murder and bring the culprits to book. The people who knew Sah remember him as a mild-mannered, genial person. He had left his house in the same municipality after his wife’s death some 10 years ago. He came to Kherariya Tol and built the temple for Hanuman where he lived alone. Locals said the temple was renovated last year under Sah’s guidance. Two weeks prior to his murder, locals said Sah had had an altercation with an unknown group. Mayor of Madhav Narayan Municipality Birendra Prasad Yadav said that the same group could have murdered Sah. “He was one of the friendliest people in the area. Why would anyone kill him?” said Yadav.Police said the motive behind Sah’s murder is still a matter of investigation.Sah’s body was discovered by police when they reached the temple after reports about gunshots in the area. “We found his body outside the temple. He was lying beside his plate of unfinished meal,” said DSP Bharat Shrestha, spokesperson for the District Police Office. Sah’s murder has sparked protests in many parts of the country, including Dang and Sunsari districts.The Rautahat-chapter of Bishwa Hindu Parishad, a Hindu organisation, recently submitted a memorandum to the Chief District Officer Indra Dev Yadav demanding that the authorities catch Sah’s murderers and bring them to justice.“It’s been almost 10 days since the crime and the police have not made any arrests yet. It is our demand that the perpetrators are captured at the earliest,” said Om Prakash Bhai Madhesiya of the Parishad.","Published at : August 28, 2020",Rautahat,Shiva Puri
Locals in Rautahat protest the death of youth arrested on murder charge,"The locals of Garuda Municipality in Rautahat surrounded the Area Police Office on Thursday afternoon to protest the alleged police torture and subsequent death of 19-year-old Bijay Mahara.Bijay, who was arrested on murder charge on August 16, was pronounced dead while undergoing treatment at the Birgunj-based National Medical College on Thursday morning.The accused, along with six others, was being held at the Garuda-based Area Police Office for the alleged murder of 20-year-old Niranjan Ram of Jigadiya in Garuda Municipality Ward No. 8 on August 15. Ram was found dead in his village with his throat slit. On Thursday, a large number of people organised a sit-in in front of the police office and chanted slogans. Police personnel were deployed in the area to bring the situation under control. “My son died of torture at the hands of the police. We were not allowed to meet him since the day he was arrested. The police didn’t even let us meet him when he was taken to the hospital,” said Bijay’s father, Panilal Mahara. “His health condition was perfectly fine. He died because the police beat him ruthlessly.”Similarly, Nathu Ram, a Dailt leader in Garuda, said, “Bijay was beaten to death while in police custody. There should be an investigation into the matter and the policemen who were involved in the beating should be punished.” However, police have refuted the allegations. “Bijay had kidney-related illnesses prior to his arrest. He was taken to Garuda-based Anamika Hospital after he complained of difficulty in urinating and obstructive bowel movement. He was later referred to the Birgunj-based hospital on August 20,” said DSP Gyan Kumar Mahato of the Area Police Office in Garuda. “He was not tortured in custody. He died of his illness.” Dr RB Prasad of Anamika Hospital said that they found traces of blood in Bijay’s urine and stool sample. “The patient’s haemoglobin levels were dropping and we found blood clots in his urine,” said Prasad. “When we asked Bijay if he had any problems, he said that he saw blood in his urine. We then asked the police to take him to another hospital with advanced health facilities.”The relatives of the deceased have demanded that a separate police team be formed to investigate the incident and a post mortem be conducted in the presence of rights activists. They have also demanded the suspension of DSP Mahato from the Area Police Office in Garuda.“Bijay is innocent in this incident. He was falsely accused of murder. This is police brutality,” said Shekh Karimullaha, a local political leader. However, according to DSP Mahato, all of the accused have admitted their involvement in the crime. “They also reenacted the murder incident in the police office,” said Mahato. Bijay is survived by a wife and their seven-month-old daughter.","Published at : August 27, 2020",Rautahat,Shiva Puri

He used to drink excessively since the early morning. The alcohol took his life,"" said his mother, Asalan Devi.According to the people's representatives, unemployment is one of the leading causes of alcohol abuse in the two settlements. ""The family members and relatives informed us that their loved ones died due to excessive drinking,"" said Shubha Narayan Yadav, the ward chairman of Sakhuwanankarkatti-1.A team of health officials led by Hari Narayan Chaudhary, the health coordinator of the local unit, reached the settlement on Monday to inquire about the incident.

Kalaiya Hospital in Bara shut down after its employees test positive for the coronavirus,"Kalaiya Hospital in Bara has closed all its services from Thursday after 11 of its employees contracted coronavirus.All services, including the emergency ward, OPD, labour ward, X-ray services and laboratory, have been closed, said Medical Superintendent at the hospital Birendra Mandal. The 50-bed health institution is the only government-run hospital in the entire district with around 200 people relying on it for medical services every day, said Mandal.A doctor and 10 other health workers and staff at the hospital who tested positive for the virus are currently in isolation.Health workers blame the hospital administration for the virus’s spread in the hospital, saying they were not provided with the necessary safety equipment while dealing with Covid-19 patients. A technician at the hospital, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said, ""Health workers at the hospital were infected with coronavirus due to the hospital’s negligence. The hospital failed to arrange for health and safety equipment for its staff.""Mandal, however, claims that it was due to the negligence of the health workers that led to the spread of the virus inside the hospital. “The health workers deployed in Covid-19 wards started visiting market areas and went about their normal lives after the government lifted the lockdown in July,” he said. “This led to the spread of the virus inside the hospital.” According to Mandal, the virus was first detected in three individuals working at the hospital. ""And despite all the precautions we took, other staff also got infected,” he said. The services will resume in the next few days after the hospital gets disinfected, he added. The federal and provincial government had allocated Rs 10 million and Rs 52.9 million respectively in the fourth week of April to Kalaiya Hospital to set up a temporary Covid-19 facility. The budget was to cover the costs for additional human resources, run Intensive Care Units and buy ventilators for the temporary hospital, said Paras Prasad Sah, the Province 2 assembly member from Bara.Four months since the budget allocation, the temporary hospital is yet to be set up. According to Mandal, the budget could not be utilised due to “technical difficulties.” “The hospital authorities had invited e-tenders and carried out the technical evaluation of some items,” Mandal said. “We brought the items but the District Treasury Office, which mobilises the fund, did not agree to pay for the items.” The infection tally in the district reached 191 in the third week of July.Given the steady rise in the number of infections in the district, the Bara district administration has imposed an indefinite prohibitory order from August 2.“We decided to impose a prohibitory order in Bara because Birgunj in the neighbouring Parsa district began witnessing a surge in coronavirus cases, “ said Rudra Prasad Pandit, the chief district officer of Bara. “There has been an increase in public movement across the two districts, as many individuals from Birgunj have their businesses in Bara.""“We issued a prohibitory order after 60 new infections were detected in the district,"" Pandit said.On Wednesday, 30 individuals, including five security personnel, tested positive for the coronavirus, said Pandit.","Published at : August 9, 2020",Bara,Laxmi Sah
Local units reimpose lockdown measures following rise in Covid-19 cases,"Most local units in the country have started reimposing lockdown measures following a rise in the number of Covid-19 cases. There has been a surge in cases since the nationwide lockdown was lifted from the midnight of July 21.In Province 1, local units like Dharan, Itahari, Duhabi and Inaruwa have declared complete lockdown for at least a week starting Wednesday. In the last few days, these local units have reported transmission of the coronavirus at the community level. On Wednesday, an executive meeting of Dharan Submetropolis decided to reimpose the lockdown for a lack of a better alternative to curb the virus transmission, according to the sub metropolitan office. Strict measures will be adopted for at least a week with fines imposed on the public if found violating the submetropolis’ directive. According to Bed Narayan Gachhadar, mayor of Duhabi Municipality, the bazaar area and the municipal office have been sealed to the public. “We will have to ensure that the lockdown order is executed effectively. Anyone found violating the order will be fined Rs 5,000,” Gachhadar said. Rajan Mehata, mayor of Inaruwa Municipality, said reimposing lockdown was a necessary move to stop the community spread of the virus. In Province 2, only two of the eight districts remain open after authorities decided to impose prohibitory orders following an explosion of coronavirus cases in the province. However, for the locals, the lockdown means subsequent financial ruin. For the past four months, businesses have had to close their shutters and people have struggled for a lack of income. Small roadside businesses are among the worst-hit by the lockdown and these businesses are likely to suffer more with the reimposition of the lockdown. Chhotu Sah Pahalwan, a local of Kalaiya Sub Metropolis in Bara, sells snacks at Bharat Chok. His business was hit hard by the four-month-long lockdown, and he had just resumed business about two weeks ago when the prohibitory order was imposed in the metropolis. For the last four days, Pahalwan hasn’t been able to wheel his cart out to the market to make a sale. “We somehow survived the four months of lockdown. We lived on the bare minimum,” said Pahalwan, who is the sole breadwinner for his family of five. “This is the only way I can make money. I hadn’t been able to sell much in the past weeks but at least I was selling enough to provide for my family. But now I can’t even do that.” Mithalesh Sarraf, a shop owner in Kalaiya bazaar, has had to close his business because of the prohibitory order. “I sell electric fans and summer is the only time when I make money. But this year I haven’t been able to sell much since I haven’t opened my shop this summer,” he said. “The authorities should come up with alternatives to this lockdown. We can’t put our lives on hold forever.” Market areas of Kalaiya, Jitpur Simara, Nijagadh, Kolhawi, Mahagadhimai, Simraungadh and Parwanipur, among other areas in Bara, have also been shut for the past four days until further notice.“We survived the lockdown but we’re not sure if we will come out unscathed out of this second phase of lockdown measures,” said Gauri Prasad Jayasawal, who runs an eatery in Kalaiya Ward No. 5. “My business has gone kaput. I see no signs of recovery if we are to stay under lockdown indefinitely. It’s time the government comes up with a better plan to help us survive the effects of the pandemic.” However, none of the authorities have so far come forward with concrete plans to help small business owners tide over the financial crisis, said Jayasawal.On Sunday, the District Administration Office in Bara had imposed an indefinite prohibitory order in many parts of the district due to a spike in coronavirus cases.The number of positive cases has been adding up every day, leaving the district administration with no other alternative than to execute prohibitory orders, says Chief District Officer of Bara Rudra Prasad Pandit. “New cases of coronavirus are being reported on a daily basis and it’ll only get worse if we don’t act now. The administration had to impose a prohibitory order in the district to stop the further spread of the virus,” Pandit said. Besides banning small businesses from operating in the midst of the pandemic, the Bara administration has also stepped up its inspection of large industries to ensure that they are adopting health and safety protocols. Jagadamba Enterprises and Maruti Pharmaceutical Industry were sealed and barred from operating until further notice after a few Covid-19 cases were reported from their offices on Wednesday. “We have also started inspecting other industries, and those found not adhering to health and safety protocols will be sealed,” said Pandit. Kailari Rural Municipality in Kailali has also declared an indefinite lockdown from Thursday. The rural municipality, which shares its border with India, has struggled to curb people’s movement across the border since the nationwide lockdown was lifted. “We have to reimpose the lockdown to stop the unwanted movement of people,” Lajuram Chaudhary, chairman of the rural municipality, said. “An executive meeting held on Wednesday decided to reimpose complete lockdown in the rural municipality for an indefinite period.” Meanwhile, local authorities in Nuwakot of Bagmati Province and Syangja in Gandaki Province on Wednesday decided to extend the prohibitory order for an indefinite period. The two districts had imposed prohibitory orders last week. The District Administration Office in Nuwakot decided to extend the order after two coronavirus cases were identified in Bidur and Kakani on Wednesday.Chief District Officer in Nuwakot Jhankanath Dhakal said, “We have extended the prohibitory order to contact-trace and identify possible patients.” Likewise, Ganga Bahadur Chhetri, chief district officer of Syangja, said, “Syangja has reported 59 coronavirus cases since the lifting of the lockdown. The recent cases are without a travel history, indicating community transmission of the virus in the district. Putali bazaar, Galyang and Arjun Chaupari areas, where recent cases were reported, are currently sealed.” With inputs from our local correspondents.","Published at : August 6, 2020",Bara,Laxmi Sah
Province 2 does not have enough beds for surging number of Covid patients,"The Province 2 government has decided to add 500 more beds in its isolation facilities to facilitate the treatment of Covid-19 patients in the province. A growing number of coronavirus patients in Province 2 are being sent home to self-isolate for a lack of resources in hospitals, but the move has proved ineffective in curbing the spread of the virus. On Tuesday, Chief Minister of Province 2 Lal Babu Raut called a meeting in Janakpur and informed of his government’s plan to add more beds in hospitals specified for coronavirus treatment. According to the Ministry of Social Development, there are a total of 2,449 isolation beds in the province. Among them, 680 are occupied as of Tuesday. The existing Covid-19 hospitals in the province are operating with limited facilities. Janakpur Provincial Hospital, Narayani Hospital in Birgunj and Gajendra Narayan Singh Hospital in Rajbiraj have isolation centres but are not well equipped to deal with the pandemic, said Dr Ranjit Kumar Jha, the medical superintendent at Gajendra Narayan Singh Hospital in Rajbiraj. “Regular hospital services have been affected due to the increase in the number of coronavirus patients in the past few days,” he said. “We have to provide both general health services and treat Covid-infected with limited resources. The hospital is stretched thin.” On July 26, 209 swabs were collected from Mina Bazaar in Ward No. 11 of Birgunj Metropolis as a part of a mass tracing campaign. Out of the collected swab samples tested at the laboratory of Narayani Hospital, 32 tested positive for coronavirus on July 30. But a majority of infected people in Mina Bazaar have been asked to stay home for a lack of hospital beds. According to locals, the Covid-infected individuals haven’t been observing home quarantine as instructed by the authorities. Shatrudhan Sah, a local of Mina bazaar, said, “We have informed the medical superintendent of Narayani Hospital about the carelessness of Covid-infected individuals. The medical superintendent agreed with us that the metropolis should manage isolation or quarantine centres to accommodate all infected people. But coronavirus patients are still being sent home to self-isolate.” Dhurba Nepal, ward chairman of Mina Bazaar, said the ward does not have the data on the number of Covid-infected individuals on home quarantine. In Birgunj Ward No. 11, swab samples of 252 individuals were collected on July 30. Among them, 75 tested positive for coronavirus this week. Twelve of the 75 infected individuals have been sent home to self-isolate. Pradhumna Sedhai, the ward chairman, said, “We are coordinating with hospitals and the local administration to move the patients to isolation centres so as to remove them from the community until they recover.” In Parsa, 24 Covid-infected individuals are kept at isolation wards in Siddhartha School, 15 in Trijudda School and 12 in the isolation unit of Birgunj Prison. Lalit Kumar Basnet, the assistant chief district officer of Parsa, said the local administration has been preparing to set up a separate Covid Hospital in Parsa after home isolation proved ineffective in curbing the spread of the virus. “Home isolation and some of the community isolation centres are not safe. That is why we are preparing to set up a separate hospital,” Basnet said. Until Tuesday, out of 3,000 swabs collected in Parsa, 607 have tested positive for coronavirus. The data of the Ministry of Social Development showed that 5,045 swab samples have tested positive for coronavirus in Province 2 as of Tuesday. Among them, 19 died and 3,211 individuals have been discharged from various isolation centres and health facilities in the province. According to the ministry’s data, 62,288 swab samples have been collected for PCR testing until Tuesday. Meanwhile, Minister of Internal Affairs and Law Gyanendra Kumar Yadav said the provincial government has introduced a new strategy to control the spread of coronavirus in the province. “The infection rate has increased in various districts of the province after the lockdown was lifted. We have to work together to stop the further spread of the virus,” said Yadav, in a Covid-19 Prevention Programme organised at Bardibas on Tuesday. Santosh Singh in Dhanusha, Bhusan Yadav in Birgunj, Abdhesh Kumar Jha in Saptari and Sunita Baral in Mahottari contributed reporting.  Frequently asked questions about the coronavirus outbreakUPDATED as of September 22, 2020What is Covid-19?Covid-19, short for coronavirus disease, is an illness caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, short for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Common symptoms of the disease include fever, dry cough, fatigue, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In severe cases, the infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. How contagious is Covid-19?Covid-19 can spread easily from person to person, especially in enclosed spaces. The virus can travel through the air in respiratory droplets produced when a sick person breathes, talks, coughs or sneezes. As the virus can also survive on plastic and steel surfaces for up to 72 hours and on cardboard for up to 24 hours, any contact with such surfaces can also spread the virus. Symptoms take between two to 14 days to appear, during which time the carrier is believed to be contagious.Where did the virus come from?The virus was first identified in Wuhan, China in late December. The coronavirus is a large family of viruses that is responsible for everything from the common cold to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). After an initial outbreak in Wuhan that spread across Hubei province, eventually infecting over 80,000 and killing more than 3,000, new infection rates in mainland China have dropped. However, the disease has since spread across the world at an alarming rate.   What is the current status of Covid-19?The World Health Organisation has called the ongoing outbreak a “pandemic” and urged countries across the world to take precautionary measures. Covid-19 has spread to 213 countries and territories around the world and infected more than 31,405,983 people with 967,505 deaths and 22,990,260 recoveries. In South Asia, India has reported the highest number of infections at 5,557,573 with 88,943 deaths. While Pakistan has reported 306,304 confirmed cases with 6,420 deaths. Nepal has so far reported 65,276 cases with 427 deaths.How dangerous is the disease?The mortality rate for Covid-19 is estimated to be 3.6 percent, but new studies have put the rate slightly higher at 5.7 percent. Although Covid-19 is not too dangerous to young healthy people, older individuals and those with immune-compromised systems are at greater risk of death. People with chronic medical conditions like heart disease, diabetes and lung disease, or those who’ve recently undergone serious medical procedures, are also at risk. How do I keep myself safe?The WHO advises that the most important thing you can do is wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizers with at least 60 percent alcohol content. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unclean hands. Clean and disinfect frequently used surfaces like your computers and phones. Avoid large crowds of people. Seek medical attention if symptoms persist for longer than a few days.Is it time to panic?No. The government has imposed a lockdown to limit the spread of the virus. There is no need to begin stockpiling food, cooking gas or hand sanitizers. However, it is always prudent to take sensible precautions like the ones identified above.","Published at : August 4, 2020",Janakpur,Ajit Tiwari

"As Covid-19 cases rise, Parsa authorities enforce indefinite prohibitory order in the district starting Monday","Following an explosion of Covid-19 cases, Parsa District Administration has enforced a prohibitory order for an indefinite period in the district starting Monday.A meeting of the District Security Committee on Saturday, chaired by Chief District Officer Bishnu Kumar Karki, decided to impose a districtwide prohibitory order.An earlier prohibitory order imposed since July 25 was applicable to Birgunj Metropolitan City only.“We have seen a sudden rise in the number of Covid-19 cases in the district. After the lockdown was lifted, increased public movement was seen in the district, including the inflow of people from across the border,” Lalit Kumar Basnet, assistant chief district officer, told the Post from Birgunj over the phone. “The District Administration Office has enforced restrictive measures so that we can control further spread of the virus and focus more on mass testing.”Mayor of Birgunj Metropolitan City Vijay Sarawagi and Pradeep Yadav, a lawmaker from Parsa-1, also have tested positiveWith the restriction order in place, individuals will not be allowed to come out of their houses, except for medical emergencies or other unavoidable essential works. All other services except the essential ones have been suspended in the district. The district office, in its statement, has said that public movement through border points too has been banned.“After industries were re-opened, cases had gone up even among workers who could further bring infection to the city areas,” said Basnet. “Nearly 400 trucks enter the district with essential items from India. Workers loading and unloading these items can easily be exposed to the virus infection.”According to Basnet, the district has so far reported a total of 14 deaths due to Covid-19. All four deaths reported due to Covid-19 on Friday were from Parsa district with total cases reaching 482 till Saturday.“However, all those who have died due to Covid-19 are not residents of Parsa,” said Basnet. “Parsa hosts people from several other districts including neighbouring Bara district and those tested positive were also admitted in hospitals here.”Parsa recorded 66 new Covid-19 positive cases on Saturday as the nationwide tally crossed 20,000.With recent spikes of Covid-19 cases in Tarai districts and major towns, mainly in Province 2, similar prohibitory orders have been enforced in several places. In the west, Banke district has imposed similar restrictions whereas eastern cities like Biratnagar which have been on lockdown for the last two weeks, Mahottari District Administration Office has placed a five-day prohibitory restriction for district headquarters and parts of the district.","Published at : August 2, 2020",Kathmandu,Chandan Kumar Mandal
Lack of ventilators in Province 2 hospitals contributes to Covid-19-related deaths,"On Sunday, a 38-year-old man from Sahidnagar in Dhanusha was taken to the Janakpur-based Provincial Hospital after he reported having Covid-19-like symptoms—high fever, common cold and difficulty in breathing.Doctors at the hospital started his treatment in the emergency unit for heart and lung ailments and also collected his swab samples for PCR test. The patient needed immediate ventilator support, according to the doctors at the hospital, but all three ventilators were in use at the time. “The patient was then referred to Dharan-based BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences following requests from his family members,” said Nagendra Yadav, medical superintendent at the Provincial Hospital. The man died on the way to the hospital. “Following his death, the man’s PCR report came back positive,” said Yadav. His family members now blame the hospital for his death, as it could not manage a ventilator on time.The man had crossed into India a few days ago to buy chemical fertilisers, according to family members. Currently, there are only seven ventilators in Province 2’s government hospitals—three in Janakpur Provincial Hospital and four in Narayani Hospital in Birgunj. Although the provincial government in April had reached the decision to purchase 50 ventilators for government hospitals, the decision is yet to be implemented. On April 19, a Cabinet meeting had permitted Rs 680 million budget for the purchase of 50 ventilators and other essential medical equipment required to fight Covid-19. The Ministry of Social Development had to purchase 50 ventilators, two PCR machines, PPEs, sanitisers, masks, gloves and other medical items from the allocated budget. The government had planned to distribute five ventilators each to six districts of Province 2 and send 10 ventilators each to Janakpur and Birgunj. On Sunday night, Chief Minister of Province 2 Lal Babu Raut called for an immediate meeting in Janakpur following the death of the 38-year-old man. He asked Dinesh Thakur, acting secretary of the Ministry of Social Development, to furnish an explanation to the delay in the purchase of ventilators. A secretary of the province who was present at the meeting but was not authorised to speak to the media said Thakur did not have an answer. “People have started to die due to lack of ventilators. The government had allocated the necessary budget to purchase ventilators but they were not bought on time. This is shameful,” the secretary quoted Raut as saying in the meeting. According to him, the officials of the Ministry of Social Development and Provincial Health Supply Division blamed each other for the delay in the procurement process. Dr Pramod Yadav, chief at the supply division, said his office had invited a tender for the purchase of ventilators on June 19 and started the process for the purchase on June 29. “But Ram Prasad Ghimire, the secretary of the Ministry of Social Development, got transferred and we couldn't complete the procurement process as decided by mid-July,” he said. “If the process starts now, we can make the purchase within 15 days.” Meanwhile, Dr Ramkewal Sah, a member of the expert group formed for Covid-19 prevention and control in Province 2, said, “All eight districts of Province 2 share an open border with India. The rate of coronavirus infection in Bihar in India is growing at an alarming rate. The effect of the rise in cases there can be seen in Province 2.” According to him, it has become increasingly necessary to reimpose complete lockdown in the province. “Prohibitory orders do not work well here. The province needs to go under lockdown again,” he said. Prohibitory orders have been imposed in Rajbiraj and Birgunj from July 23 and July 25 respectively following a resurgence of coronavirus cases in these cities.Sah also stressed the need for hospitals in the province to be well-equipped with ventilators to minimise the loss of lives due to Covid-19. “Around 50 ventilators should be kept on standby. Number of symptomatic cases are surging and the death rate has increased in the province. The only fully equipped hospital is in Dharan,” he said. “It is necessary to manage human resources and medical equipment to start ventilator services in the hospitals of Province 2 as well.” According to data of the Ministry of Social Development in the province, 18  Covid-19-related deaths and around 650 new infections have been reported in several districts of Province 2 in the past few weeks. The data showed 643 new cases were confirmed in the last two weeks only. The ministry said the majority of cases confirmed in the past few weeks were symptomatic.The data available at the ministry shows that a total of 4,768 positive cases were reported in all eight districts of the province as of August 1; among them, around 3,100 patients have returned home after treatment.","Published at : August 2, 2020",Janakpur,Ajit Tiwari
Province 2 witnesses resurgence of coronavirus infections and deaths,"Ten Covid-19 related deaths and around 650 new infections have been reported in several districts in Province 2 in the past few weeks. According to the Ministry of Social Development in the province, as many as 643 new cases were confirmed in the last two weeks. The ministry said the majority of cases confirmed in the past few weeks were symptomatic. The data available at the ministry shows that a total of 5,106 positive cases were reported in all eight districts of the province as of July 30; among them, around 3,000 patients have returned home after treatment.With the sudden spike in the number of infections, authorities suspect undetected outbreaks of community transmissions in various places of the province. The local administration of Dhanusha district on Tuesday sealed Rama Hotel, Machhapuchchhre Bank and a pharmacy in Janakpur after coronavirus infections were detected among the hotel and bank employees. Covid-19 was also confirmed among three staff members of the Social Development Ministry in Janakpur on Wednesday. Another person in Janakpur, who had participated in a recent immunisation programme, has also tested positive for coronavirus infection. Health workers have collected swab samples of all 33 immunisation officers who were part of the immunisation drive. There has been an explosion of coronavirus infection in Birgunj of Parsa and Rajbiraj of Saptari in recent days. The local administration of Parsa has issued a prohibitory order in Birgunj city from Saturday, suspecting community transmission of the disease.Only on Wednesday, 13 people at Birgunj prison, including some inmates, employees and police personnel, had tested positive for Covid-19. Jailor Shrawan Kumar Pokharel said the test results of eight prisoners, two employees and three police personnel have come positive. “There is a high risk of infection in the prison,” said Pokharel.Among the two infected employees of the prison, one is a driver and another an office assistant. The driver had ferried patients from the jail to various hospitals for treatment and the office assistant was deployed at the main gate of the prison facility.Health experts suggest covering more ground with contact tracing and increasing the range of polymerase chain reaction tests in Province 2, as security personnel, health workers, prisoners and the people without travel history have been found infected with the deadly virus. “The government should increase PCR tests in Birgunj, Rajbiraj, Janakpur and other places immediately to control the disease,” said Dr Ram Kewal Sah, a member of Covid-19 Control and Advice Committee of Province 2. “Imposing a prohibitory order is not enough. Complete lockdown should be enforced in Province 2 as it shares a border with India which puts the province at higher risk of Covid-19 outbreak.” Sah also pointed out the shortage of ventilators in various Covid-19 hospitals in the province and urged the concerned authorities to make arrangements for the treatment of Covid-19 patients in hospitals with ventilators.According to the data at the Provincial Health Directorate in Janakpur, only nine ventilators are in use in the state run hospitals in Province 2.A Cabinet meeting of THE Province 2 government in April had decided to release Rs 680 million to purchase medical equipment including ventilators. The meeting had also decided to procure 50 ventilators immediately. But the concerned government agencies have yet to procure the ventilators.","Published at : July 31, 2020",Janakpur,Ajit Tiwari						 &
Coronavirus infected patients sent home to self-isolate as Parsa’s Covid hospital exceeds its bed capacity,"As many as 26 coronavirus infected people in Parsa have been sent home to self-isolate after Gandak Hospital, the only Covid-19 treatment facility in the district, exceeded its bed capacity. Seventeen other patients have been kept at isolation wards in four different quarantine facilities in Birgunj, Parsagadhi, Sakhuwaprasauni and Thori.The Birgunj-based hospital is overwhelmed after a sudden spike in the number of coronavirus patients in recent days, according to the hospital. “We are unable to admit new patients. We are currently treating 58 coronavirus patients,” said Dr Udaya Narayan Singh, the coordinator of the hospital. There is an increased risk of coronavirus spreading in communities if the patients who have been self-isolating at their homes are not careful, Singh warned. “We know that a lot of the patients may not be able to practice self-isolation in its true sense,” said Singh. “For patients who live in small homes, there is an increased risk of them infecting their immediate family members who, in turn, could infect the people in their communities.” The hospital has exceeded its 50-bed capacity and so have other quarantine centres.Singh said they had no option but to tell the patients to observe self-isolation at their homes. Meanwhile, the hospital authority is also dealing with the challenge of preventing the infection among the staff and other patients. “A doctor, a junior health worker and a maintenance staff have already contracted the infection while many non-Covid patients have recently developed symptoms like breathing difficulty, sore throat, body ache, fever and diarrhoea,” said Singh.Health officials have said the district needs to expand its treatment and quarantine facilities in order to stem the spread of the virus. An isolation ward set up by the Nepal Army at a school building in Birgunj about a month ago has not come into operation as it still lacks proper infrastructure, medical equipment and human resources. “The isolation ward cannot be run in its current state,” said Singh.After Birgunj metropolis saw a spike in the number of coronavirus cases, the district administration has imposed a prohibitory order in the city for an indefinite period from Saturday. However, many people doubt that the infection rate is going down by restricting public mobility when coronavirus infected patients are being sent home to self-isolate. “The infected individuals have already come in contact with their families and the family members have met with people outside their immediate circle,” said Hari Panta, a resident of Birgunj.The office of Birgunj metropolis, however, claims that the situation in the city is under control. Mayor Bijaya Kumar Sarawagi said that the city office has been coordinating with other government agencies in the fight against Covid-19.“We plan to conduct polymerase chain reaction tests of at least one member of every family in Birgunj. We will be covering around 50,000 households in the city,” said Sarawagi. As for the infected patients being sent home to self-isolate, the mayor said his office has entrusted the responsibility of treating the patients visiting Gandak Hospital to Narayani Hospital administration some three months ago.  “The administrations of these two hospitals should seek solutions to accommodate the patients, instead of asking patients to self-isolate at home. The mayor’s office cannot make a decision regarding the number of beds in hospital,” said Sarawagi.   Dr Madan Kumar Upadhyay, medical superintendent at Narayani Hospital, does not agree with the mayor. “Gandak Hospital does not have the kind of infrastructure that will allow us to increase the bed capacity .The local government should set up more isolation wards in quarantine centres to ease the burden on the hospital. They could also set up other hospitals in the city to accommodate more Covid-19 patients,” he said. According to Lalit Kumar Basnet, the assistant chief district officer of Parsa, the number of Covid-19 patients staying in quarantine facilities and those self-isolating at home has reached 43 in the past one week. “We have asked some infected people to self-isolate at home. In the meantime, we are also preparing to use Narayani Hospital and National Medical College to treat Covid-19 patients,” he said.A total of eight people—four from Parsa and four from other districts—have succumbed to Covid-19 in Birgunj so far. Parsa, a central Tarai district in Province 2, has 291 positive cases as of Tuesday.","Published at : July 29, 2020",Parsa,Shankar Acharya

Floods and landslides continue to claim lives and displace people across country,"Monsoon-induced calamities continue to take lives and displace entire settlements in many districts of provinces 1, 2, Bagmati and Gandaki. At least seven people died and two others have gone missing in landslides and floods across the country in the past 24 hours.According to the District Police Office in Dhading, three members of a family died in a landslide at Guljung in Tripurasundari Rural Municipality on Monday night. “A couple and their two-year-old daughter died when a landslide buried their house.

Three others were injured in the incident, police said. In Province 2, two people have gone missing after being swept away by flooded streams in Mahottari and Rautahat districts. According to the provincial police office in Janakpur, floods and inundation have displaced 219 families and damaged 38 houses in Saptari, Sarlahi and Rautahat districts in the past few days. In Morang district of Province 1, as many as six settlements are at high risk of floods as the rain-swollen Bakraha stream has been eroding its embankment. DSP Lokdarshan Thapa said, “Settlements in Sunbarshi, Ratuwamai, Patharishanishchare and Urlabari are at risk of floods.” The local administration shifted four landless families from Chaita to a safer location on Tuesday after the flooded Chaita stream started eroding embankment in the area. “Around 150 metres long embankment in Chaita has been eroded. The settlement is at risk of being swept away if the flooded stream breaches its embankments,” said Bhilananda Yadav, chief of the Koshi and Bakraha River Management Project.According to him, efforts are on to repair the embankment and control the stream.

Locals still cross Lalbakaiya river in Tikuliya Ghat by boat,"Two years ago, five people were killed when a boat carrying 29 people across the Lalbakaiya river capsized after hitting an under-construction bridge in Tikuliya Ghat of Gaur Municipality Ward No. 4, Rautahat.The incident occurred in the peak of monsoon season when the water level in the river was high.The under-construction bridge is still incomplete, and thousands of people are still compelled to cross the river through boats risking their lives.The bridge in Tikuliya Ghat was supposed to connect dozens of villages—including Banjaraha, Baraiya, Mathiya, Jokaha, Bairiya, Akolawa, Rampur—to Gaur, the district headquarters of Rautahat. The bridge project was handed over to the controversial Pappu Construction in July 2014. The company was supposed to complete the Rs 149.3 million project by July 2017. But the bridge could not be completed due to the contractor’s negligence.Since then, Pappu Construction has been blacklisted by the government for failing to deliver on the contracts and carrying out substandard works, among other charges. With the bridge project abandoned, many people in Gaur still take boats whenever they have to get across the Lalbakaiya river. During the monsoon season, crossing the river is fraught with risk.Many people have their fields in Banjaraha, and to reach there they have to cross the river. Suraj Sah, a resident of Tikuliya, said he gets scared whenever he has to cross the river by boat, particularly after the boat capsize incident. “I lost my relative in the incident two years ago,” said Sah. “We waited for a long time for the completion of the bridge, but that never happened. We are still compelled to take risks while crossing the river during monsoon,” Sah said.There’s only one wooden boat to take people across the river. The boat can carry up to 20 people and their belongings at a time.“Being the only boat in operation, it is always crowded,” said Sah.During the winter, when the water level in the river is low, people cross the river through a diversion. But during the monsoon, the locals have no option but to take the boat to get to the other side of the shore.Bhuvaneshwar Shahi, the ward chairman of Gaur Municipality-4, said only 65 percent of the bridge was completed in four years of construction.“People lost their lives because of the carelessness of the construction company. Yet, the authorities concerned are not serious about completing the bridge,” said Shahi.  Pappu Construction had claimed that the construction work of the bridge was delayed due to lack of construction materials, protests and the 2015 earthquakes, among other reasons.","Published at : July 19, 2020",Rautahat,Shiva Puri

Province 2 braces for floods as incessant rainfall sends rivers gushing,"Officials and residents of Province 2 are on high alert after local rivers witnessed surges following incessant monsoon rains for the past three days.Chief Minister Lal Babu Raut, who met chiefs of security agencies in Janakpur on Friday, directed them to prepare for possible disasters. “We are on high alert and have mobilised rescue teams in disaster-prone areas,” said Deputy Inspector General (Armed Police Force) Raju Aryal. “Areas where floods wreaked havoc last year are being closely monitored,” he added.Security units are on standby on the riverbanks in Rautahat, Sarlahi, Mahottari and Saptari districts and they are equipped with necessary resources to conduct rescue and relief work. The water level in the Koshi, Kamala, Bagmati, Bakaiya, Ratu, Khando and Lakhandehi have surged to danger levels following continuous rainfall. In the second week of July 2019, floods triggered by incessant rains had affected all eight districts of the province. Property worth millions of rupees was destroyed after the floodwaters breached the embankments of various rivers and entered settlements. “Last year, the floods and inundation affected us severely. This year again, we are witnessing heavy rains. We have asked security teams to stay prepared for any disasters to prevent loss of lives and properties,” said Chief Minister Raut. According to the Saptari District Police Office, 38 out of 56 doors of the Saptakoshi barrage have been opened after the water crossed the danger level on Friday morning.

Locals living near the banks have been alerted, said Khadka.Pressure on the western embankment in Nepal, some 19km south of the barrage, has been steadily increasing for the past few days given the rainfall, officials said. Increased water flow has put different parts of Hanumannagar Kankalini Municipality at risk, said Mayor Shailesh Kumar Sah. Similarly, a ward in Tilathi Koiladi Rural Municipality near the western embankment is also at risk of flood, said Satish Kumar Singh, chair of the rural municipality.In Rautahat, vehicular movement along the Lachka road section of the East-West Highway has been obstructed since Friday morning due to flooding. Around 300 vehicles, including trucks, remain stranded. Some villages in the northern parts of the district have been waterlogged due to lack of proper drains. Eighty percent of the district had been inundated during last year’s monsoon. In Mahottari, 19,788 households are at risk of floods and inundation, officials said. The District Disaster Management Committee predicts that 14 out of 15 local units in the district will be inundated this year too. Raj Kumar Das, a resident of Bhangaha Municipality-4, said he feels threatened as his house is next to the Ratu river. “It feels like my house can be washed away any minute. The river is swelling and will soon break its embankments.” Every year, floods in the Ratu, Jangaha, Maraha, Banke, Bigahi and Baksi claim lives and property in the district. Krishna Bahadur Katuwal, Mahottari Chief District Officer, said they have already identified safe locations for people who need to be evacuated and also purchased equipment (needed for relief and rescue works). Local units like Bhangaha, Balawa, Ekdara, Jaleshwor, Mathihani, Mahottari and Manarasiswa also claimed that they have worked towards mitigating the risk of a disaster in the area this year. Bhangaha Mayor Sanjiv Sah said, “We completed the construction of an embankment on the Ratu river this year. We hope the embankment will hold the river this year.” On Wednesday, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority issued a statement forecasting incessant rainfall from Thursday to Sunday in Province 1, Province 2, and Bagmati and Gandaki provinces. “The water level will increase in the Kankai, Koshi, Kamala, Bagmati and Narayani and their tributaries,” the statement reads, “We urge people, especially those residing near the rivers that flow through Chure and Tarai in Province 1 and 2, to remain on alert from Friday to Sunday.”The authority also warned of possible inundation in parts of Jhapa, Morang, Sunsari, Saptari, Dhanusha, Mahottari, Siraha, Sarlahi, Bara, Parsa, Rautahat and Chitwan districts.Shiva Puri in Rautahat, Abdhesh Kumar Jha in Saptari and Sunita Baral in Mahottari contributed reporting.","Published at : July 11, 2020",Janakpur,Ajit Tiwari

Sexual exploitation case filed against Ram Bahadur Bomjan in Sarlahi,"A case of sexual exploitation was filed against Ram Bahadur Bomjan, the controversial “spiritual leader”, in the District Court in Sarlahi on Thursday.In the chargesheet, the District Attorney Office in Sarlahi has demanded 12 to 15 years of jail term for Ram Bahadur Bomjan and his two aides, Gyan Kumar Bomjan and Jit Bahadur Tamang, for their involvement in the sexual exploitation of a minor. The chargesheet accuses Ram Bahadur of raping a 15-year-old girl who was staying in his ashram in Pattharkot, Sarlahi, as an Aani (Nun). The case filed against Ram Bahadur stated that he raped the minor by luring her to his private quarters at 9:20pm on August 4, 2016. He has further been charged of threatening the girl of consequences if she relayed the incident to others. On February 23 this year, a complaint against Ram Bahadur was registered at the District Police Office in Sarlahi when the victim turned 18.Although the District Court had instructed the district police office to arrest Ram Bahadur and his two accomplices a long time ago, police are still unable to trace and arrest the defendants. “On Thursday, the District Attorney Office filed a case of sexual exploitation against Ram Bahadur Bomjan and his two aides, as the deadline of their arrest is close to expiring,” Keshav Prasad Gautam, district attorney in Sarlahi, said. “The attorney office has demanded 12 to 14 years of jail term for the accused in accordance with the Criminal Code. The code mandates 12 to 14 years of jail term for raping a girl aged between 14 and 16.”According to the District Attorney Office, the charge sheet also demands compensation for the victim. Ram Bahadur Bomjam is also wanted by the authorities for the disappearances of four of his disciples. In mid-June, a joint team from the Central Investigation Bureau, the Bagmati Provincial Police and the district police offices in Kavre, Sindhupalchok and Sarlahi raided his ashram in Pairey Sindhuli, but could not locate him.He had shot to fame in 2005 for allegedly meditating for months without food, water or sleep.

Child marriage goes unchecked in rural areas of the country,"Police on Thursday prevented the marriage of an underage girl at Bhapsi in Bardibas Municipality No. 3 of Mahottari.Acting on a tip-off, security personnel reached the groom’s house on Thursday and detained the people involved in the marriage of a 16-year-old girl with a 24-year-old man.In an apparent move to hoodwink the police, social organisations and the neighbours, the guardians took the teenager to Tuteshwor Temple at dawn and performed the wedding rituals, after which she was taken to the groom’s house.“The police team reached the groom’s house on time, took the couple and their guardians under control and cancelled the marriage,” said Deputy Superintendent of Police Rajan Chapagain. The bride, who is an eight grader at a local school, told the police that her guardians had forced her to marry the man who is eight years her senior. According to Chapagain, the girl has requested the police to manage an environment for her to continue her studies.“Both the bride and the groom were handed over to their respective families after the guardians agreed to let the girl continue her studies, not arrange her marriage until she completes 20 years of age and not put any mental stress on her,” Chapagain saud. The guardians of both sides signed an agreement paper to that accord in the presence of ward Chairman Rajan Dhungana.“The guardians of both sides were trying to get them married for the past five months, but their attempts were foiled due to the vigilance of various social organisations and the ward level child welfare committee,” said Junu Sunar, the programme coordinator of Samudayak Pariyar Kalyan Sangh, an organisation working against child marriage, in Mahottari.Despite several awareness programmes launched by the government and various social organisations to curb the practice, underage marriage still goes unchecked in the district. Around 80 cases of child marriages were reported in Bardibas Municipality alone in the past two years. Ward Chairman Dhungana, who is also the chairman of the ward child welfare committee, urged everyone to work together to put an end to the social malpractice.Although Nepal abolished child marriage in 1963, the practice is still rampant, especially in the Madhesi communities and in rural areas of the country. According to the Civil Code, the minimum age for marriage in Nepal for both women and men is 20.A Human Rights Watch report published in 2016 states that around 37 percent of girls in Nepal marry before the age of 18 and 10 percent are married by age 15. Nepal has the third highest rate of child marriage in South Asia, after Bangladesh and India.","Published at : June 30, 2020",Mahottari,Sunita Baral
Poor management continues to afflict people quarantined in Tarai districts,"In the quarantine and isolation facilities of Rautahat and Sarlahi districts, two of the most affected districts by Covid-19 in the country, individuals complain of poor sanitation, ill-furnished rooms, and mosquitos. They say health workers hardly visit those centres and the infected people in the isolation wards are not getting any medical attention.As of Sunday, Rautahat has reported 1,343 Covid-19 cases, the highest in the country, and Sarlahi has 649 cases. The cases are rising by dozens a day in both the districts.One infected individual at an isolation centre in Sarlahi said that doctors rarely come to check up on him. “We may win the battle against coronavirus by god’s grace, but we will always remember the poor facilities and outright neglect we’ve had to undergo. As summer is here, there are mosquitos but nothing to protect us from them,” he said.On Thursday, a video from a quarantine centre operated by Chandrapur Municipality leaked on social media. The video showed a woman complaining of poor security and management of the facility. But local unit officials claimed that the video was a “propaganda” targeted against them. Chandrapur Mayor Ram Chandra Chaudhary claimed that quarantine centres maintained by his local unit are the “best in the district” and the video does not reflect the true state of the facilities. “We cannot provide five-star services to the quarantined,” he said. “But we are providing all the basic amenities. We will look into the matter and find out if there are any problems. If we find any, we will ask for clarification from quarantine chiefs.”Rautahat has over a 100 quarantine facilities spread across its 18 local units with over 800 individuals placed in them.

"Incompatible PCR test kits will raise infection risk, Parsa health officials warn","The Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) lab at the Narayani Hospital in Birgunj is closed since Monday, as the PCR test kits supplied by the federal Ministry of Health and Population are incompatible with the machine.A total of 1,300 swab samples deposited at the lab have now been sent to the National Public Health Laboratory in Teku, Kathmandu, for testing.According to Dr Madan Kumar Upadhyay, chief medical superintendent at the hospital, the lab also lacks reagent chemicals and RNA extraction but the pressing issue is the incompatibility of the kits with the machine.“The PCR test kits supplied from Kathmandu doesn’t match with the machine we have,” Upadhyay said. “We have notified the national public health lab about the issue.”The hospital, however, has received no response yet, he said.On Monday, health ministry officials said that around 28,000 PCR test kits purchased by the Nepal Army aren't compatible with most PCR testing machines. According to one health ministry official, the PCR kits supplied by the army use 1ml viral transport media, but most machines in the 22 laboratories operating across the country use 3ml viral transport media.In early April, a tender with Omni Business Corporate International was annulled by the Department of Health Services following allegations of corruption and irregularities against the company. Subsequently, the Nepal Army was roped in to procure medical equipment necessary to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic through a government-to-government deal.The incompatibility of the testing kits will have serious ramifications in highly affected districts like Rautahat and Parsa, health officials say. Rautahat has the highest Covid-19-infected patients in the country, with 1,159 cases as of Tuesday evening; Parsa has 158 cases, with one death. Narayani lab was used not just to test swab samples from Parsa, but also from other neighbouring districts such as Bara, Rautahat and Sarlahi. The lab has so far tested as many as 7,299 swab samples.In the past two months, the Narayani hospital has received PCR kits from eight different companies, all of which were compatible with the hospital's machine, according to Upadhyay. But the kits recently cannot be used with the machine owned by the hospital.The kits are incompatible not just in Narayani lab but in all other labs across the country, including in Koshi, Chitwan, Hetauda and even the Kathmandu-based National Public Health Lab.The closure of the lab will have both short-term and long-term consequences, Upadhyay, the medical superintendent, said. “This will delay the testing of thousands of people who might have been infected with the coronavirus,” he said, adding that it will lead to increased transmission of the virus as the infected may move around their communities freely while awaiting their test results. “It will allow the virus to run rampant through the communities in the district while many await their results.”","Published at : June 24, 2020",Parsa,Bhusan Yadav
In-custody death of a Musahar man sparks protests in Janakpur,"The in-custody death of a Musahar man in Janakpur has prompted protests against police.Shambhu Sada, 23, was found dead of an apparent suicide inside the toilet of his cell in the Sabaila Area Police Office on June 10. He had turned himself in to the police after his tractor killed 42-year-old Sumindra Devi Sah and injured another person at Dhanusadham on May 25. While police say that Sada committed suicide, his friends and family have contested the police's claim. Siyali Devi, Sada's mother, has alleged that the police murdered her son and staged his death as a suicide. Following Sada's death, his friends and family have been organising protest rallies in Janakpur demanding a fair and impartial investigation into the case. On Thursday, the day after Sada's death, protesters vandalised the Area Police Office.Sada's body remains at the morgue in the Janakpur Provincial Hospital. His family is demanding that the police lodge a First Information Report (FIR) before family members agree to an autopsy.Sada's family has also cast doubt on the postmortem to be carried out by pathologists at the provincial hospital.Although the police had agreed to employ a pathologist from Sada's community as per the family’s demand, the hospital had refused.Nagendra Prasad Yadav, medical superintendent at the hospital, said that the hospital’s protocol doesn’t allow outsiders to perform a postmortem on a body registered at the hospital. Superintendent Ramesh Banset, chief of the Dhanusa District Police Office, said there was no foul play involved in Sada's death and that his friends and relatives were protesting at someone else’s behest.“He killed himself on his 15th day in custody. He had hung himself from the bathroom ceiling with a shirt while security personnel were asleep,” Basnet said.Sada was the only person in custody on the night of the incident. His family was informed about his death immediately after his body was discovered and police had also called in an assistant health worker to check on Sada, said Basnet.“Shambhu’s family had even signed a written statement on the morning after the incident where the cause of death has been stated as a suicide,” Basnet said. Siyali Devi, however, said that police had pressured her into signing the document.Sada's family has filed a complaint addressing Chief Minister Lalbabu Raut at the provincial office of the National Human Rights Commission, demanding an impartial investigation into his death.","Published at : June 14, 2020",Janakpur,Ajit Tiwari
People kept at quarantine facilities in Rautahat protested against delay in PCR tests results,"Around 160 individuals who have been kept at quarantine facilities in Rajpur Municipality Ward No. 1 in Rautahat district came out of the facilities on Saturday in protest of delay in their PCR test results.Their swab samples were collected for PCR testing more than a week ago but the results are yet to come. ""Around 160 individuals quarantined at Bahuarwa Madarsha and Pipra Bhagwanpur quarantine facilities on Saturday blocked the road and pelted stones at the security personnel posted at the facilities,"" said Superintendent of Police Ravi Raj Khadka, the head of District Police Office Rautahat. “Police fired two live rounds in the air and around a dozen rounds of tear gas shells to bring the situation under control.""Teams from the Armed Police Force and Nepal Army had also reached the site to control the situation.It has been three weeks since those who returned from India have been kept at various quarantine facilities across the district. “Out of 7,500 people who have been kept in more than 100 quarantine facilities across the district, swab samples of around 6,000 individuals were collected a week ago,” said Chief District Officer of Rautahat Basudev Ghimire. ""The problem has arisen due to the delay in results."" “I returned from India after I lost my job, I have been here for three weeks and my swab sample was collected nine days ago,” said a 22-year-old man at the quarantine facility in Rajpur. “I haven’t received my report and my family is worried about my health.” On Monday, people quarantined in Dewahi Gonahi Municipality in Rautahat had threatened to call a strike in protest of delay in test results. They have been waiting for their test results for the past one and a half weeks. “Last Monday, around 250 people quarantined at Jai Kisan Secondary School in Dewahi Gonahi started protesting against the delay in test results,” said Khadka. According to the Health Ministry, 714 Covid-19 cases have been reported in Rautahat as of Saturday. Out of which, 109 people have been discharged after full recovery. Province 2 has reported 1,987 cases of coronavirus infection, the highest in a province, until Saturday. The delay in the PCR test results has compelled many to remain in quarantine for longer periods across the country.","Published at : June 14, 2020",Rautahat,Shiva Puri
Haphazard and illegal extraction of riverbed materials in Gadi stream gain pace during lockdown,"The haphazard extraction of riverbed materials from the Gadi stream in Parsa has gained traction during the nationwide lockdown period.Over 1,000 tractors are operating along the riverside, loading sand onto trucks, said Hari Narayan Chaudhary, chairman of Paterwa Sugauli Rural Municipality in Parsa. “Despite our efforts to control haphazard extraction of riverbed materials, contractor companies are working in collusion with provincial assembly members to illegally extract river materials,” Chaudhary said.Legal extraction of riverbed materials from Gadi stream was put on hold when the nationwide lockdown came into effect on March 24. But on May 31, extraction works on the stream resumed after the District Coordination Committee in Parsa allowed the tender holder to extract riverbed materials.According to Chaudhary, extraction works resumed, as there was pressure from all quarters to expedite development works in the last few months of the running fiscal year. The excavation of riverbed materials is prohibited to parties other than the company with a tender to extract such materials. On December 5, 2019, NK International Chitwan was awarded the contract to extract 31,175 cubic metres of riverbed materials from the stream. But on Monday, the rural municipal office banned the company from extracting riverbed materials citing haphazard extraction. “According to the IEE report, the stream area can be dug only up to 1 metre in depth but deep pits can be seen in the stream’s banks now; some are up to 3 metres deep,” said Shiva Kumar Chapagain, a local teacher in Paterwa Sugauli.On June 5, an inspection committee of Paterwa Sugauli Rural Municipality found two excavators, owned by assembly members of Province 2, digging riverbed materials from the stream’s banks. “The two excavators belonged to Singhasan Kalawar and Manjur Alam, assembly members of Province 2. We have prohibited the use of their excavators, as they were extracting sand illegally,” chairman Chaudhary said. Locals say Kalawar and Alam were contractors of construction projects before being elected as provincial assembly members. “But now, they are taking contracts in the name of their family members,” Sugauli said. Alam, however, denied the allegations, saying he had provided his excavator on rent. Although the Post tried to contact representatives of NK International Chitwan, the company awarded to extract riverbed materials from the stream, they were not available for comments. The contractor sent his people to settle down the issue after reporters reached the excavation site.Meanwhile, Nek Mohammad Ansari, chief at the District Coordination Committee, said the meeting of the District Coordination and Inspection Committee on May 31 had allowed the company to use machines while extracting riverbed materials.“The committee only allowed the use of machines in the stream on the basis of the IEE report. We do not interfere with the tender process. The rural municipal office should monitor ongoing extraction works within the standard of the IEE report,” Ansari said. According to the IEE report, extraction works should be carried out in the stream by maintaining the uniformity of the streambed without digging pits. It has also clearly stated that 25 metres of space should be left untouched on both sides of the stream and excavation should not be done below the water level. But this standard has not been followed. Locals complained that none of the concerned stakeholders have taken initiatives to stop the haphazard extraction in Gadi stream.“We have been protesting against the extraction of sand, pebbles and stones in the stream for a long time. But the local unit and the local authorities are not making much effort to stop the illegal extraction of riverbed materials,” said Chapagain.","Published at : June 14, 2020",Gadi (parsa),Bhusan Yadav
"Indian man dead, two others injured as Armed Police Force open fire at Nepal-India border in Sarlahi","A man was killed and two others sustained injuries when the Armed Police Force deployed for border security opened fire at a crowd that allegedly tried to attack the security personnel in Prasa Rural Municipality, Sarlahi, on Friday. Bikesh Kumar of Sitamarhi district in the Indian state of Bihar succumbed to the bullet injuries in his chest. Likewise, two other men— Uday Thakur and Umesh Rae, both from Sitamarhi— sustained bullet injuries in the incident. According to the APF, a fourth man, identified as Nawal Kishor Rae, was captured after he allegedly tried to snatch the weapons from the security personnel. SP Gangaram Shrestha, the APF district in charge, said the incident happened after four Indian traders who were turned away by the security personnel from the border returned with hundreds of people and began protesting at the border. “They came back with hundreds of people to protest which soon turned violent. Our security personnel opened fire as the unruly mob started attacking them,” said Shrestha. According to eyewitnesses, the seven-member APF team was outnumbered by the advancing protesters. Just as the security personnel were forced to retreat from their post, witnesses said the mob started to attack.“Our officers fired 10 rounds of warning shots but the mob did not yield. They started attacking the security personnel who in turn shot at them,” Shrestha said.Chief District Officer Mohan Bahadur GC said the APF personnel had to shoot at the crowd because they became violent despite warning shots that were fired into the air. “The situation at the border point is tense at the moment,” said GC. The local administration has deployed additional APF and Nepal Police personnel at the incident site. The Indian Border Security Force has also mobilised its officers. A few days ago, a group of suspected Indian smugglers had tried to attack the Nepali security personnel at Phenhara in Sarlahi.","Published at : June 12, 2020",Sarlahi,Om Prakash Thakur
"In Saptari, a Musahar woman is accused of practising witchcraft and beaten","Early on Sunday, Fainaku Sada set out on his bicycle to meet his married daughter in Fatehpur. He left behind his wife, Manjudevi, and their four children, at their home in Mahadeva Rural Municipality, Saptari. Fainaku wanted to know how his eldest daughter and her family were faring during the lockdown.Back in Mahadeva, 35-year-old Manjudevi was preparing lunch for her four children when she heard loud cursing outside. It was her sister-in-law, Bhutiyadevi, and her 19-year-old son Sandip shouting from their home, just about 10 metres north of Manjudevi’s.“At first, I didn’t even realise that the cursing was directed towards me,” Manjudevi said. But quickly, the mother-son duo came into Manjudevi’s house and began to attack her. “They beat me with their fists and a metal plate,” Manjudevi said. “My head began to bleed and in no time, my body was soaked in blood.”Manjudevi fell unconscious on the floor while her children started crying and the mother-son duo kept hurling curse words at her.Bhutiyadevi and Sandip accused Manjudevi of employing witchcraft to kill Bhutiyadevi’s granddaughter, who had died within a week of being born back in November. Bhutiyadevi is only 40 but she is already a grandmother, as most Musahar women are married off at a very young age. Sandip is her youngest son.Manjudevi sustained deep cuts to her head and she couldn’t even get to a hospital. “I was in no condition to walk to the hospital, nor did I have any money to treat my injury,” she told the Post.She called her husband, who returned home midway to their daughter’s home. Fainaku then took her to a clinic three kilometres away on his bicycle.They have yet to pay their medical bill of Rs4,000.After Sunday’s incident, images of a bleeding Manjudevi had circulated on social media, prompting condemnation and a demand for justice for Manjudevi. “Shame on humanity,” one Twitter user wrote. “Is this one’s fault to become a helpless woman in this country? It’s too unbearable.”Others called on the state to put in place stern provisions against such activities and ensure strict punishment for violators.“Activities like accusing someone of practising witchcraft, denying Dalits entry to temples, burning women alive for a dowry are products of a mad, anarchistic mentality,” another user wrote on Twitter. “These are very wrong activities and the state should come up with stern laws to punish them.”Even before the assault on Manjudevi, she was already in dire straits. Manjudevi’s family lives in a home constructed out of zinc sheets, mud and bamboo on ailani land, land that has not been registered privately and belongs to the government. Fainaku, a daily wage worker, has been unable to find any work ever since the lockdown was put in place over 75 days ago. On Sunday, after Manjudevi was given primary treatment, the couple went to the local police post to register a complaint but the officials asked them to come back with a complaint in writing. According to Manjudevi, the couple don’t know how to write a complaint and comply with other police procedures. They also went to the ward chair, who asked them to go to the rural municipality chief. On Tuesday, a village panchayat met in the ward office to resolve the issue. A panchayat is a body composed of village elders who decide on many matters of dispute. Even though they hold no legal authority, their decisions are widely respected within their communities. “The meeting concluded that the case should be confined within the community and should not be taken to the police,” Manjudevi said. “I objected, saying that the perpetrators should be punished as I was accused of practising witchcraft. But the panchayat told me to negotiate and live in harmony.”The 2015 Witchcraft Act prohibits any accusations of witchcraft and stipulates a jail term for five to ten years and a fine of Rs 50,000. But accusations of witchcraft, almost always followed by acts of violence, continue across the country. Often, these accusations follow financial disputes and are almost directed at marginalised members of the community by those with better socio-economic standing.Even though both Bhutiyadevi and Manjudevi are from the marginalised Musahar community, the former has a relatively better economic status as Bhutiyadevi’s husband and eldest son work in India.On Wednesday, Manjudevi went to the Kanchanpur Primary Hospital to receive more treatment. “I didn’t have any money, so I sold the wheat grains we had in store,” she told the Post over the phone from the hospital. “I will also submit a written complaint to the police.”Bhutiyadevi herself admitted to beating Manjudevi, but not because she thought the latter was a witch. “I lost control in a sudden fit of anger,” Bhutiyadevi told the Post. “I will give her the money for treatment.” Police on Wednesday arrested Sandip, Bhutiyadevi’s son. “He wasn’t arrested for accusing someone of being a witch but rather for harassing and beating a woman,” said Deputy Superintendent Naresh Singh of the Kanchanpur Area Police Office.But this is not the first time that Manjudevi was beaten and accused of practising witchcraft. A similar incident took place in 2014 when her neighbours got together to beat her, she said. Back then too, she was ordered by the panchayat to negotiate with the perpetrators. But this time, she is resolute in not complying. “I have been accused and cursed of being a witch countless times,” Manjudevi said. “I don’t like this panchayat system that orders me to settle for medical treatment money in order to maintain social harmony. What kind of harmony is it for me to endure abuse from perpetrators time and again? Why do I have to always put up with this?”","Published at : June 11, 2020",Saptari,Abdhesh Kumar Jha
Police arrest Rautahat brick kiln ‘massacre’ suspect,"Police on Saturday night arrested a man over the Rautahat brick kiln “massacre” in which “nearly a dozen” people were allegedly “burnt alive” 13 years ago.Mukti Sah, 55, arrested in Simraungadh, near the India-Nepal border on Saturday, had been on the run since the incident took place on April 9, 2008. He was presented before the court on Sunday, said Deputy Inspector General Dhiraj Pratap Singh, head of provincial police.Sah worked as a carpenter at the time of the incident, according to police. Nine other suspects of the incident are still at large. The main suspect, Mohammad Aftab Alam, was remanded in custody at Nakkhu Jail, Kathmandu, in November.Alam, a Nepali Congress leader and elected member of Parliament, was arrested on October 13 last year in connection with the incident. At least two people had been killed and two dozen others injured by a blast that rocked Rautahat ahead of the elections. According to eyewitnesses, the people injured in the blast, were allegedly burnt alive in a brick kiln under Alam’s orders ""to destroy the evidence"" related to the blast.Two months after the incident, Alam turned himself in to the police on June 23, 2008 when a first information report was filed identifying him as the primary accused. A month later, the Office of the Attorney General decided against pursuing a criminal case against Alam and five other suspects.Responding to a writ petition filed on behalf of the victims, the Supreme Court in May 2012, four years after the incident, had ordered that the case be expedited.""There is enough ground to investigate the case and move it forward,"" a joint bench of judges Sushila Karki and Bharat Bahadur Karki had said, ordering the Rautahat District Police Office to arrest those named defendants in the writ petition.The court order, however, remained unimplemented, leading the petitioners to file a complaint with the Judgement Execution Directorate in March 2019. Alam was arrested seven months later in Rautahat.Prosecutors have charged Alam with attempted murder and holding and transporting explosive materials. The exact number of “victims” in the case is still uncertain, but authorities put the number at nearly two dozen.In May, police had raided Alam’s home in Rautahat to look for his brother, also implicated in the case.","Published at : June 7, 2020",Rautahat,Shiva Puri
The lockdown is killing the poor and the marginalised,"It was mid-April, a month into the nationwide lockdown, when Malar Sada came home empty-handed to Pathari.Malar had walked 120 kilometres to his village in Saptari, all the way from Biratnagar where he had gone to work a month before the lockdown came into force. When the contractor that he worked for refused to pay him citing the lockdown, Malar decided he would fare better at home.“He came home empty-handed,” Jaleshwari Sada, Malar’s wife, told the Post on the fourteenth day of Malar’s demise. “He said that he would go to get the money once the lockdown ended.” The next month was difficult for the Sada family. The lockdown meant no work and no work meant no income. The three Sada sons were stuck in Gujarat, where they had gone to work, and couldn’t send any money home. Malar and Jaleshwari had no work of their own and their meagre savings had run out.On May 18, a month after he had walked home, Malar set out in the evening, carrying a spade and an umbrella. He was going to look for foodstuff, anything that could be used to stave off hunger.“Our grandson brought home the news that he was lying in the fields,” said Jaleshwari. “Our daughters-in-law brought him home.” Malar died the next morning. The Sada family had had nothing to eat for the past five days except for niguro (fiddlehead fern) gathered from the nearby Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve. Malar died of acute hunger, say his relatives.It has been over two months since the KP Sharma Oli government enforced a nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of Covid-19. The country has abided by the lockdown, obeying stay-at-home orders and duly closing down shops and businesses. But cases of Covid-19 continue to increase exponentially across the country, reaching 2,300 so far, with no signs of a plateau. The most vulnerable of families are doubly victimised. They cannot afford to catch Covid-19 but they cannot afford to stay at home and not work either. For working families like the Sadas, even a day without work can place them in dire straits, resulting in incidents like Malar’s death. The Sadas belong to the Musahar community, which is among the most marginalised of communities in the country. And if the lockdown continues in the same fashion, with no real relief measures aimed at struggling families, Malar’s fate could be shared by many more. “We used to have daily wage work here and our sons brought home their earnings from India,” said Hasiyadevi Sada, Malar’s sister. “We had enough for two meals a day. How will we survive now?” Two of Hasiyadevi’s sons are also in Gujarat, unable to come home since Nepal has closed its borders to everyone, including Nepalis. But even if they return, there is no food to eat and nowhere to labour. Every morning, while kindling the fire in the hearth, Hasiyadevi wonders what she will feed her four grandchildren, two daughters-in-law, her husband and herself. Most days, there is only niguro. Hasiyadevi’s family has little in the name of land, just three dhurs (around 50 square metres), which means there’s hardly anything to grow.And there are numerous other families in the settlement in even worse conditions.Sixty-year-old Shiva Sada sold half of the 10 kilos of rice he’d received as relief for Rs200 to buy medicine for his leg. He fractured his leg last year while working in Kashmir and cannot move without crutches. The injury never healed properly and Shiva needs to take regular medication. The injury has also meant that Shiva is unable to go to India for work anymore, leaving his wife Phinadevi to collect and sell niguro. But ever since the lockdown, there is no market for her greens. The niguro fetches between Rs 30 to 40 a bundle in Kathmandu, but all Phinadevi makes is Rs 2.Calls have recently grown for the government to lift the lockdown, but they are primarily from the private sector business community given their monetary losses. What is unfolding across Nepal is a humanitarian crisis, where many Nepalis have little to eat and need to depend on the kindness of strangers to survive.Recently, Surya Bahadur Tamang, a daily wage labourer, was found dead on the streets in Kirtipur. Last week, thousands of migrants entering Karnali Province were forced to sleep outdoors with no food for days. In many places, local governments are hamstrung by a lack of funds. In others, mismanagement and corruption have exacerbated the plight of many Nepalis. In Malar Sada’s case, the local government had refused to provide the family with financial support for the funeral unless they formally declared that he had died of asthma, not hunger.Mayor Basant Mishra readily admitted that he had asked the family to declare Malar’s cause of death as asthma. “When we went to meet Malar’s family the next day of his death, family members told us that he had died of asthma,” Mishra told the Post. “Later, they started saying that he had died of hunger.”Jaleshwari refutes Mishra’s version, saying her husband had only had a cough and was not an asthma patient. She performed Malar’s death rituals by collecting Rs 1,500 from her neighbours after the municipality refused to provide relief.While the local authorities quibble over details, the plight of the Musahar community is getting worse by the day. The infant of 15-year-old Radha Sada, whose husband is stuck in India, is underweight.  Post file photo: Prakash Chandra TimilsenaFifteen-year-old Radha Sada’s month-old son weighs 2.5kg when he should weigh at least one kilo more. The only nutritious food she eats is the lentils she received as relief. Her husband Dani Sada is stuck in Gujarat with no job and problems of his own. The rice and lentils she received as relief are fast running out and Radha has no one to turn to. But ward chair Kailash Sah says he has no time to go looking for people who are starving. “They talk to outsiders, but don’t inform us that they don’t have food to eat,” said Sah. “We also have much work to do. We cannot visit every house to see if the occupants are starving. They should come to the ward office.” No one knows of Radha’s situation and how long she’ll be able to survive on the little rice and dal that remains. “If I could just get some work, I can manage food,” said Radha. “But I don’t know if we’ll be able to survive the lockdown.”","Published at : June 4, 2020",Saptari,Binu Subedi						 &
Seven kidney patients have died in the last 36 days at the National Hospital in Birgunj,"On May 12, Krishna Thakur of Bahudarmai Rural Municipality in Parsa visited the Birgunj-based National Medical College and Teaching Hospital for dialysis. He had undergone dialysis at the same hospital three times already, but this time, his health began to deteriorate upon reaching home. He was admitted to the hospital’s Intensive Care Unit on May 17 and the next day, he died. “Krishna did not have any other serious health problems. He had been undergoing regular dialysis at the Narayani Hospital for the past four years,” said Santosh Thakur, Krishna’s brother-in-law. “He died due to the negligence of doctors at the National Medical College and Teaching Hospital.” Krishna started going to the National Hospital after his regular health care centre, Narayani Hospital, was designated a Covid-19 hospital by the authorities. From his very first visit to National, Krishna had begun to report health problems, said Santosh. But doctors had told the family that the dialyser chemical they were using was different from the one used at Narayani and things would stabilise within a few days. Krishna’s health never stabilised. But Krishna is not the only kidney patient who died recently at the National Hospital. In the last 36 days, 40 kidney patients have been referred to the National Hospital by Narayani Hospital, and seven have died. “The health condition of all seven patients was stable when they were receiving dialysis services here,” said Narendra Kushwaha, a health worker at the renal unit of Narayani Hospital, which is a government-run sub-regional hospital. “Their condition might have deteriorated due to negligence during dialysis.” On April 21, 45-year-old Nasharin Bano of Birgunj 12 was rushed to the emergency when her health worsened during dialysis.“She died within a few minutes,” said Mohammad Kalam Sheikh, Bano’s husband. On May 21, 50-year-old Taibun Nesha of Rautahat began vomiting on her way home after dialysis at the National Hospital. She died the next day.The seven who’ve died so far at the National Hospital are Krishna Thakur, Nasharin Bano, Taibun Nesha and Ranjit Mandal of Rautahat, Nagendra Jha of Birgunj, Ajaya Karki of Sarlahi and Nandalal Mahato of Bara.On April 12, the health emergency and disaster management unit at the Ministry of Health and Population directed the National Hospital to provide treatment to kidney patients referred from Narayani Hospital since the latter had been turned into a coronavirus-specific hospital. The ministry had also instructed National Hospital to not charge higher medical fees than those prescribed by the health insurance board.Following the deaths, other kidney patients are now wary of visiting the National Hospital for dialysis. Family members of the patients who died also submitted a memorandum to the Parsa chief district officer on May 27, demanding an investigation into the deaths.According to Rambishwas Kushwaha, a family member of a kidney patient in Birgunj, the health workers at National Hospital operate the dialysis machine at a higher speed than at the Narayani Hospital and that while Narayani used one dialyzer only twice, National was using the same dialyser up to 10 times.“The time duration of one dialysis session at Narayani Hospital is around three hours but at National Medical College and Teaching Hospital, a session lasts only an hour and a half,” said Rambishwas.According to Dr Niraj Singh, chief of the renal department at Narayani Hospital, one dialyser can be used for a maximum of three to four times and that each dialysis session should last up to three-and-a-half hours.Basruddin Ansari, director of the National Medical College and Teaching Hospital, admitted that the hospital was functioning under pressure to treat kidney patients referred from Narayani Hospital.“We were providing dialysis services in three daily shifts earlier. We now have to run up to five shifts after an increase in patients referred from Narayani Hospital,” said Ansari, who was a mayoral candidate for Birgunj from the CPN-UML during the 2017 local level elections. “The patients died after their dialysis was over and when they had reached home. It is not our responsibility if a patient dies at home.” Locals are now afraid of seeking treatment at National Hospital but they have few choices. Narayani Hospital has remained closed since April 14 and dialysis is not a medical procedure that can be put off.  “The government advised patients to seek treatment elsewhere but failed to ensure proper dialysis services,” said Taiyab Miya, a relative of a kidney patient. “Seven kidney patients are now dead.”","Published at : June 3, 2020",Birgunj,Bhusan Yadav

Infected people stay in quarantine centres for lack of isolation ward,"As many as 12 people infected with Covid-19 in Godaita Municipality, Sarlahi, are staying in various local quarantine facilities due to the lack of an isolation ward in the district.The Health Ministry on Saturday morning confirmed 13 positive cases in Sarlahi—12 from Godaita and one from Kabilashi Municipality—taking the tally in the district to 33. Even after the official confirmation, the 12 infected people in Godaita are still staying in quarantine facilities, as the district does not have an isolation ward. Isolation wards in the Provincial Hospital in Janakpur and the Narayani Sub-regional Hospital and Gandak Hospital in Birgunj do not have any beds left to accommodate the increasing number of positive cases in Province 2.“We are compelled to keep the infected people in quarantine facilities, as the coronavirus-specific hospitals in Janakpur and Birgunj refused to admit them citing lack of beds,” said Devendra Yadav, the mayor of Godaita Municipality. Thirteen people of the local unit had tested positive for the virus on Friday. According to Yadav, all the infected people are recent returnees from India.With a surge in the number of positive cases in Sarlahi, the district administration is preparing to set up an isolation ward in Malangawa, the district headquarters, to house the infected. “We have started work to set up an isolation ward in a nursing campus at Ward No 2 in Malangwa. We will shift the infected people there once the work is completed,” said Chief District Officer Mohan Bahadur GC. He added that the infected people might be shifted in the isolation ward by the end of this week. Twenty-five people in Godaita Municipality have tested positive for the disease so far, and polymerase chain reaction tests of many others staying in various quarantine facilities are yet to be conducted. Yadav said. Over 130 people who recently returned from India are staying in various quarantine facilities in the municipality. Health workers on Tuesday collected the throat swabs of 81 people in Godaita and five in Ramnagar Rural Municipality, and sent them to Kathmandu for PCR tests. “Twenty-five people of Godaita and one from Ramnagar have tested positive for the virus while reports of other swabs are yet to come,” said GC.The man from Kabilashi Municipality who tested positive on Saturday morning had also returned from Mumbai, India, a few days ago. He had returned home along with 40 other people. “All the people who returned with the infected man and their families have been kept in quarantine facilities,” said Diplal Raya, ward chairman of Kabilasi Ward No.1.","Published at : May 24, 2020",Sarlahi,Om Prakash Thakur
Police raided Mohammed Aftab Alam’s home in Rautahat on Thursday night in search of his brother,"Province 2 police on Thursday evening raided the house of Mohammed Aftab Alam in Rautahat. The Nepali Congress leader and former minister is currently in police custody at Nakkhu Jail for his involvement in a bomb explosion and the subsequent murder of 23 people in Rautahat 12 years ago.Police raided Aftab’s house to search for his brother, Mahatab Alam—another alleged perpetrator of the incident. The raid, however, was unsuccessful. The locals, unaware of the police’s raid, thought there was a robbery in the neighbourhood and encircled the security team. The police had to fire warning shots a dozen times to disperse the crowd, according to a police officer involved in the raid.Mahtab has been on the run since Aftab was arrested in October, 2019. The raid was carried out by a joint team of Bara police and the provincial police. “We conducted the raid after we received a tip-off that Mahtab had visited his home,” the police officer said on conditions of anonymity. “We later had to call Rautahat police when the locals came out in large numbers.” Information about the raid was not passed on to the Rautahat district administration, according to Basudev Ghimire, chief district officer. DSP of Rautahat Police Bharat Shrestha said that a team from the district police joined the provincial police later after the locals gathered at the site.Sheikh Shakil, mayor of Rajpur municipality, said that the police’s impromptu raid disturbed the Alam family and the community. “We are concerned about the way this raid was conducted,” Sakil said. “We condemn the unilateral act.” Aftab was arrested on October 13 in connection to a bomb blast in Fradahawa, Rajpur, in the district that took place on April 9, 2008. Police had arrested him on the charges of attempted murder and holding and transporting explosive materials, and he also faces charges of burning injured people alive in a brick kiln ‘to destroy evidence’.Aftab Alam was elected to the federal parliament from Rautahat-2 in the 2017 elections. He has also served as a minister in the Madhav Kumar Nepal government.","Published at : May 23, 2020",Rautahat,Shiva Puri
Province 2 asks federal government to halt three television shows over their discriminatory content towards Madhesis,"The Province 2 government has written to the federal government demanding a halt to the production and broadcasting of three television shows over their derogatory content towards the Madhesi community.In a letter to Minister for Communication and Information Technology Yubaraj Khatiwada, Province 2 Chief Attorney Dipendra Jha had called for taking three television shows–'Corona Birsaune Guffgaff', 'What The Flop' and 'Joginder Bole Pradamji'–be off air from national television channels over its content.“[Characters] in these three television shows as well as some feature films are being used to demean a certain community [Madhesi community] through their dialogue, acting and caricature for the entertainment of a certain section of people,” reads the letter. “Such acts could disturb the national unity and communal harmony.”The letter has been copied to the Home Ministry, National Human Rights Commission, Madhesi Commission, Office of the Attorney General, Press Council Nepal and Film Development Board.In the letter, the Province 2 government has requested to stop such discriminatory programmes so as to ensure people’s constitutional and legal rights.“We request you to treat this letter as a complaint and initiate investigation into all those and take action,” reads the letter.‘Corona Birsaune Guffgaff’, a television show on Krishi Television, was doing rounds on social media on Wednesday, where callers made fun of a character, who pretends to be a Madhesi, while the anchor appears to be complicit.Nepali Congress lawmaker Gagan Thapa also expressed his displeasure towards such programmes. “Wordings and contents of 'Corona Birsaune Guffgaff', aired on Krishi Television, would affect the self-esteem of the whole Madhesi community.,” Thapa tweeted on Thursday. “It is unconstitutional to discriminate again and offend any group or community.”","Published at : May 21, 2020",Janakpur,Ajit Tiwari

Police hit 67-year-old with baton for stepping out to buy milk,"On Sunday morning, 67-year-old Nagendra Patel, a retired employee of Nepal Telecom in Birgunj Metropolis-16, was on his way to a nearby grocery store to buy milk. A grandfather to two children, Patel goes out for milk every morning. Somewhere between National Medical College and Naya Bus Park, police stopped Patel and interrogated him. They asked him to return to where he had come from. Patel turned around to go back home when one of the police personnel hit him on his right leg with a baton. Those gathered nearby, watching the incident unfold, helped Patel get up from where he had fallen and carried him to his house.Patel couldn’t stand upright, so at 8am on Sunday, Gunjan, Patel’s son, took him to the National Medical College. Doctors there took an X-ray of his injured leg and plastered it. “The bone in my right leg below the knee is cracked. Doctors have asked me to keep the plaster for three months,” Patel told the Post.Bhola Shah, who runs Ramayan Hotel in Birgunj-16, was one of the witnesses to the incident; he had helped Patel reach home that morning. “Patel is an acquaintance. After the police hit him, he fell to the ground and couldn’t get up. We carried him home,” he said.Gunjan went to Naya Bus Park to the personnel deployed at a temporary police post with questions about the incident. “But when I asked them, they said it was the Tiger team who beat up my father,” said Gunjan.The Tiger team under the District Police Office was formed to control smuggling, theft and other unlawful activities during the lockdown in Birgunj. “There was no argument; they asked me to return and I was doing just that,” said Patel. “But they charged me from behind.” Bijaya Shahi, the sub-inspector in charge of the temporary police post, said, “The victim has not come to us with a complaint. But I have been inquiring about the details of the incident.”According to Shahi, personnel from the Area Police Office in Shreepur and the District Police Office in Birgunj also conduct frequent patrols in the city areas.In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic and amid ongoing nationwide lockdown, police have been drawn into controversy for responding to the crisis with increasingly draconian measures. On Monday, Naya Patrika daily reported an incident involving a man who faced harassment at the hands of police. According to the report, the man, who was tending to his ill wife at Bir Hospital, was stopped in Kalimati and asked to strip down his shirt. On Friday, Parsa District Crisis Management Centre allowed police to open fire against those who flee the quarantine and isolation centres in the district. The decision was revoked later in the evening with rights activists decrying the move as “utterly wrong.”","Published at : May 18, 2020",Birgunj,Bhusan Yadav
Matihani municipality in Mahottari seals off its border with India,"Matihani Municipality in Mahottari has placed temporary bamboo fences along the one-and-a-half-kilometres-long border it shares with Madhwapur bazaar in Bihar, India, to stop the cross-border movement of people. The local unit constructed the fence following the recommendation of the District Disaster Management Committee in Mahottari.According to the representatives of the municipality, the move was made to prevent the possible spread of coronavirus in the local units, as cross-border movement of people is still rampant despite the nationwide lockdown in place. Matihani locals cross the border to Madhwapur bazaar, the nearest market area, to buy daily essentials. Hari Prasad Mandal, mayor of the municipality, said security personnel of the Armed Police Force in Mahottari helped the local unit put up the bamboo fence. “The border has been sealed from Garibnath Temple to Parsa Gaun. The municipality invested Rs 200,000 and used 2,500 bamboo trees to build the fence,” said Mandal. “For the time being, the barrier has been constructed to stop people’s movement and encroachment from India. We will keep the barrier post lockdown too if needed.” According to Mandal, it took around a week to build and install the fence. Some work is still to be completed in the Parsa Gaun area and will be completed by Friday, he said.Nirkrishna Adhikari, superintendent of police of the Armed Police Force in Mahottari, said, “The movement of people from the border has come under control since the installation of the bamboo fence. Monitoring of the border area has also become easier.” Mahottari shares 38.6 kilometres of border area with India. The Armed Police Force in Mahottari has tightened security in 40 border points in the district after the Nepal-India border was sealed to enforce the nationwide lockdown. “We have also requested other local units to construct bamboo fences along the border,” said Adhikari, adding that some of the local units have expressed their interest to do so. “We will soon start constructing barriers in other local units as well.”","Published at : May 18, 2020",Janakpur,Ajit Tiwari
"Chhapkaiya, Covid-19 hotspot in Province 2, is at high risk of community transmission","Without mass testing and contact tracing, there is a threat of community transmission of Covid-19 in the settlement of Chhapkaiya in Birgunj, locals say. The settlement, which straddles the second and third wards of Birgunj, has already had 40 confirmed cases of coronavirus infection, and yet the authorities concerned have been slow to respond to the emergency, Mahesh Das, a local man, said.“The whole of Parsa district so far has had 91 coronavirus cases, nearly half of that is from Chhapkaiya, but there have not been enough tests and contact tracing,” Das said. “The authorities have not tested around 60 locals who had come in contact with the infected people. We fear the infection will further spread in the community.” Three Indian nationals residing in a mosque at Chhapkaiya tested positive for Covid-19 on April 12. The swabs from 21 men residing in the mosque had been tested for the coronavirus at the laboratory of the Vector Borne Disease Research and Training Center in Hetauda. It was the first coronavirus case in Province 2.Of the total infected people in Chhapkaiya, eight are the children aged four months to 14 years. Locals suspect many other children in the settlement may be carrying the virus as they used to play with the infected children.They also worry that they might have contracted the virus from the community water well situated close to the home of an infected family. As many as 18 members of a single family have been infected with the disease in the settlement.The deadly virus had been detected among those Indian nationals, who arrived at the mosque in Chhapkaiya after visiting various districts, in the first phase. After three weeks, a sanitation worker had tested positive on April 26. Soon, the infection was confirmed in other people in the settlement. On May 12, as many as 57 Covid-19 cases were reported in Parsa and 20 of them were from Chhapkaiya. The infected people are receiving treatment at an isolation ward of Narayani Hospital in Birgunj.The people’s representatives also expressed their concerns for lackadaisical response of the authorities to control the spread of the disease in Chhapkaiya.Baiju Prasad Swarnakar, the ward chairman of Birgunj-3, said there had not been enough swab collection for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests in Chhapkaiya.“PCR tests should be conducted on all the people living in the infected area. If we delay the testing, the infection will become widespread, ” Swarnakar said. A health team from Narayani Hospital had collected the throat swabs of 230 people including 80 security personnel, health workers and sanitation workers in Chhapkaiya on May 8.Lalit Kumar Basnet, the assistant chief district officer of Parsa, admitted the need for more tests in Chhapkaiya. He assured to conduct the PCR tests as per the availability of the resources.“The health team from Narayani Hospital has collected swabs of about 2,100 people in the district till Thursday. Swab collection has been delayed after the district witnessed a sudden surge in the number of infected people,” said Basnet.He said the authorities were struggling to handle the increasing cases of the disease.“Seventy-one of the total 91 infected people are kept in the isolation ward of Narayani Hospital which has the capacity of 70 people. Others are kept by establishing a temporary isolation ward in Siddhartha Secondary School in Birgunj,” he added.","Published at : May 17, 2020",Parsa,Shankar Acharya
"Parsa authorities’ decision to allow police to fire upon Covid-19 patients fleeing isolation is “utterly wrong”, say rights activists","Update: Late Friday evening, responding to public outcry, the Parsa District Administration Office revoked the directive allowing security officials to fire upon Covid-19 patients who leave the hospital isolation ward. Security officials are now authorised to use necessary force as per Local Administration Act, 1971.The Covid-19 pandemic has everyone on edge, especially as infections continue to rise across the country. But the authorities are responding with increasingly draconian measures, like the Parsa District Crisis Management Centre’s directive allowing security personnel to open fire on any infected patients who attempt to leave the isolation ward.The decision prompted outrage on social media and criticism from human rights activists who see it as a dangerous escalation and a violation of an individual’s fundamental right to live with dignity. A meeting chaired by Parsa Chief District Officer Bishnu Kumar Karki on Thursday evening directed security personnel to remain vigilant and open fire on anyone who attempts to leave hospital isolation. “Security personnel are allowed to use force to prevent infected people from fleeing hospitals and isolation wards,” Lalit Kumar Basnet, assistant chief district officer, told the Post. “They even have the right to open fire if necessary.”The decision came on the heels of an incident on Wednesday when two persons who had tested positive for Covid-19 left the isolation ward at Narayani Hospital in Birgunj. According to the hospital, the duo escaped through the bathroom. They were eventually apprehended by the Birgunj police and brought back to the hospital. According to Superintendent Ganga Panta, chief of the Parsa District Police Office, the two individuals fled from the hospital due to a lack of knowledge about the seriousness of the disease. “One of the two who escaped has a history of drug smuggling but the other one followed him as they were locked in a room with limited facilities,” Panta told the Post.But in order to prevent such a situation from arising again, the Parsa police is ready to implement the shoot order if necessary, said Panta.“When the two patients escaped, it was very difficult for our personnel to get them back to the hospital. Although we managed to bring them back without using force, it was risky work,” he said. “As an infected person can spread the virus rapidly, the shoot order will discourage people from attempting to escape in the future.”Panta said that there is a guideline to the shoot order. Police personnel will first chase down the individual and give them a warning before any shots are fired.Rights activists, however, are aghast at the decision to allow police to open fire on fleeing Covid-19 patients. Bed Prasad Bhattarai, secretary at the National Human Rights Commission, called the decision completely wrong.“Patients could be going through mental stress or trauma, leading them to leave the hospital,” Bhattarai told the Post. “Rather than focusing on possible treatment, they’ve issued a shoot order.” A Covid-19 diagnosis can prompt stress and anxiety in patients, especially those who are unaware of the severity of the disease, its symptoms and treatment, say doctors. This can lead to irrational behaviour, including a desire to go somewhere familiar. “The authorities should focus on the patients’ situation, knowledge about the disease, and their need to deal with the situation,” said consultant psychiatrist Dr Basudev Karki. “And it is not just patients; police personnel and even health workers may need counseling. The authorities need to also focus on mental health issues during this pandemic.”Karki conceded that some force might have to be used to restrain people who might want to leave despite being well aware of the disease and not having any mental health issues. He, however, said that there is no reason to open fire on patients. According to rights activists, the increasingly extreme measures that the authorities are adopting to combat the spread of Covid-19 could have the opposite of the intended effect. “The [Parsa] decision has only created more mental anguish among patients and the directive could easily be misused, too,” said Charan Prasai, a human rights activist. “This is a very serious issue and a violation of an individual’s fundamental rights. The authorities should rather focus on improving quarantine facilities.”","Published at : May 15, 2020",Parsa/kathmandu,Bhusan Yadav						 &
Protesting landowners in Betauna receive compensation amount for the land acquired by East-West Electric Railway,"The long-standing dispute over land compensation for the East-West Electrical Railway project in Chandrapur has been resolved after the protesting landowners were given compensation. The dispute had disrupted construction of the national pride project for the past five monthsThe Department of Railways has issued payment for the land acquired to construct the railway track in Betauna of Chandrapur Municipality, Rautahat. A representative of the department on Tuesday handed over a cheque of the compensation amount to the farmers. “Fifteen farmers received the compensation amount on Tuesday. We will provide compensation to the others soon,” said Amit Rijal, the project manager of the construction company. “The long-standing issue has been resolved now. We will resume construction work soon.” The project authorities had decided to acquire around 30 bighas of land belonging to 26 people in Betuna for the railway project. The landowners had formed a struggle committee and had been protesting for the past five months, demanding the re-evaluation of the compensation amount fixed by the compensation determination committee, stating that the amount was too little. The project work had come to a halt due to the protest.The committee had fixed Rs1.1 million per kattha for land with road access and Rs800,000 per kattha for land with no road access. The compensation amount for land having irrigation facilities had been fixed at Rs500,000 per kattha while the compensation for land without irrigation had been fixed at Rs400,000 per kattha. The owners of land without irrigation facilities had been protesting, claiming that their lands are connected with the irrigation channel but the authority has maintained a faulty record.The district administration office and the locals had agreed to correct the mistakes in the documentation one and a half months ago. Accordingly, the protesting landowners are now eligible to receive Rs 500,000 per kattha for their land. In the last week of April, the contractor had prepared to resume work on the railway project after the government had relaxed the lockdown and declared that construction crew could go back to work on mega projects by maintaining physical distancing. Following the government decision, the contractor had initiated work after obtaining permission from the District Administration Office. But as soon as the construction work had begun, it came to a halt, as the landowners came out to protest, demanding for the compensation amount to be paid first.According to the project contract, Lumbini, Apex and Thani JV Construction should have completed the project, which began in August 2019, by January 2022. However, the work has been disrupted for more than five months, delaying the project. The 945-km East-West Electric Railway, also called the Mechi-Mahakali Electric Railway, is one of the government’s national pride projects.","Published at : May 14, 2020",Rautahat,Shiva Puri
Province 2 teeters on edge with the highest number of Covid-19 cases in the country,"As reports of community transmission of Covid-19 in Birgunj Metropolitan City surfaced, most districts in Province 2 had not recorded a significant number of infections, apart from a few cases in Bara, Rautahat and Sarlahi districts. But, fast forward to Wednesday, seven of the eight districts of the province have a significant number of Covid-19 cases and the province has become a hotspot for infections in the country.One of the reasons the virus has spread so quickly is the way people reacted to the nationwide lockdown, which started on March 24. “More than 50 days into the lockdown, people are still coming out of their homes and socialising,” said Pradip Lal, a local of Janakpur Ward No. 9. “Only yesterday, nearly 50 locals gathered in Parwaha of Dhanusha to look at an overflowing ditch by the roadside,” said Parbhat Jhan, a Parwaha resident.“The public has still not understood the importance of maintaining social and physical distance here in Janakpur,” said Lal. As of Wednesday, 98 people have tested positive for the disease in the province. On Tuesday alone, 61 new cases of Covid-19 were confirmed and three more on Wednesday, prompting authorities to tighten the lockdown.Bara and Parsa districts issued prohibitory orders on Tuesday as most people were still found to be flouting the lockdown rules. Preparations are also on to issue the order across the province to avoid the further spread of the disease, said the province’s Minister for Internal Affairs Gyanendra Yadav. “We will have to tighten the lockdown. We are coordinating with the security forces to make the lockdown more effective.”Authorities believe that people on the south of the Nepal-India porous border are illegally entering Nepal in large numbers. Armed Police Force Superintendent Rajesh Upreti said 93 people have tried to cross the border illegally until Wednesday. Sixty-nine have been caught trying to cross a river in Siraha. “We have deployed all of the personnel available with us at various border points,” said Upreti. “But it’s impossible to stop the movement of people through informal routes without help from the locals.”The local people’s failure to inform authorities regarding the entry of people from across the border is one of the major reasons Covid-19 cases are on the rise in Birgunj, says Kameshwor Chaurasiya, chief of Parsa District Health Office. “Even the locals didn’t stop crossing the border,” said Chaurasiya, “They don’t want to let the authorities know and hide information about their visits. This is why it’s becoming more difficult for us to fight coronavirus here in the province.” Superintendent Ganga Panta of Nepal Police, Birgunj, also attributed the rise in infections to the open border as well as the general public’s disregard for the lockdown order. Panta also points out the lack of coordination between the local governments is also proving costly. “It has become difficult to work as there’s a lack of coordination, and the people are trying to pass the buck,” said Panta, “The infected and their families are in hiding, and they refuse to isolate.” Birgunj Mayor Bijay Kumar Sarawagi says lack of coordination between the local governments of the province has been a major hurdle, but what has worsened the situation is the federal and provincial governments’ apathy towards the growing risk of Covid-19 infection. “Birgunj is one of the major transit points and an economic centre of the country with goods entering for distribution across the nation,” said Sarawagi, “But authorities failed to take stock of the situation and keep Birgunj safe.”Sarawagi points out the delay in formulating plans and policies, and its implementation also contributed to the spread of the disease. Meanwhile, as the province records a geometric spike in the number of infections, it still is reeling under a shortage of medical equipment and kits to test more people. The province faces a shortage of viral transport media kits, and this in turn has prevented it from carrying out more PCR tests. “The stock of VTM kits is almost depleted and we have already asked the federal government to provide us for the kits numerous times,” said Province 2 Social Development Minister Nawal Kishor Shah, “Since the federal government hasn’t responded, the province on Wednesday bought 1,000 VTM kits on its own.”Province 2 Health Supplies Division Director Dr Pramod Kumar Yadav also informed that the province is short in VTM kits for the last two weeks.  There are currently 104 people undergoing treatment at isolation wards set up at various hospitals in Janakpur, Birgunj and Rajbiraj. The province, with 5.4 million people, has only tested 1,792 people using PCR and 3, 131 using rapid diagnostic kits.  Frequently asked questions about the coronavirus outbreakUPDATED as of September 22, 2020What is Covid-19?Covid-19, short for coronavirus disease, is an illness caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, short for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Common symptoms of the disease include fever, dry cough, fatigue, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In severe cases, the infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. How contagious is Covid-19?Covid-19 can spread easily from person to person, especially in enclosed spaces. The virus can travel through the air in respiratory droplets produced when a sick person breathes, talks, coughs or sneezes. As the virus can also survive on plastic and steel surfaces for up to 72 hours and on cardboard for up to 24 hours, any contact with such surfaces can also spread the virus. Symptoms take between two to 14 days to appear, during which time the carrier is believed to be contagious.Where did the virus come from?The virus was first identified in Wuhan, China in late December. The coronavirus is a large family of viruses that is responsible for everything from the common cold to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). After an initial outbreak in Wuhan that spread across Hubei province, eventually infecting over 80,000 and killing more than 3,000, new infection rates in mainland China have dropped. However, the disease has since spread across the world at an alarming rate.   What is the current status of Covid-19?The World Health Organisation has called the ongoing outbreak a “pandemic” and urged countries across the world to take precautionary measures. Covid-19 has spread to 213 countries and territories around the world and infected more than 31,405,983 people with 967,505 deaths and 22,990,260 recoveries. In South Asia, India has reported the highest number of infections at 5,557,573 with 88,943 deaths. While Pakistan has reported 306,304 confirmed cases with 6,420 deaths. Nepal has so far reported 65,276 cases with 427 deaths.How dangerous is the disease?The mortality rate for Covid-19 is estimated to be 3.6 percent, but new studies have put the rate slightly higher at 5.7 percent. Although Covid-19 is not too dangerous to young healthy people, older individuals and those with immune-compromised systems are at greater risk of death. People with chronic medical conditions like heart disease, diabetes and lung disease, or those who’ve recently undergone serious medical procedures, are also at risk. How do I keep myself safe?The WHO advises that the most important thing you can do is wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizers with at least 60 percent alcohol content. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unclean hands. Clean and disinfect frequently used surfaces like your computers and phones. Avoid large crowds of people. Seek medical attention if symptoms persist for longer than a few days.Is it time to panic?No. The government has imposed a lockdown to limit the spread of the virus. There is no need to begin stockpiling food, cooking gas or hand sanitizers. However, it is always prudent to take sensible precautions like the ones identified above.","Published at : May 13, 2020",Janakpur/birgunj,Ajit Tiwari						 &
19 Indian nationals out of contact since they left a quarantine facility in Saptari on Wednesday night,"Nineteen Indian nationals staying at a quarantine facility in Hanuman Nagar Kankalini Municipality Ward 1 (Koshi Barrage) left the facility on Wednesday night and have been out of contact since.The individuals managed to leave the Koshi Basic School quarantine despite round the clock security provided by personnel from Nepal Police and the Armed Police Force.There were 72 Indian nationals staying in quarantine for the last two weeks. They were on the way to West Bengal and Bihar of India from various parts of the country but were refused entry to Province 1 and were instead quarantined in Saptari. The other 53 people at the facility came to know about those who left the facility only on Thursday morning. “Their belongings including bags, slippers and shoes were found in their room. All of them were staying in a single room,” said Mukesh Kumar, one of the Indian nationals staying in the quarantine. “There are security personnel deployed 24/7. How did they manage to flee the facility unsuspected?”Koshi barrage is the border between Provinces 1 and 2. “The missing individuals have not reached Sunsari. They can only enter India by crossing the Koshi river on a boat,” said a local resident. “Those who escaped from the facility must be hiding in one of the settlements.” Since the lockdown, the local unit and security personnel have been monitoring all boats on the Koshi river, according to locals. Hanuman Nagar Kankalini Municipality has been providing food and accommodation for the individuals staying in the quarantine. According to the municipality, those at the facility haven’t undergone coronavirus tests.Washing his hands off the situation, Mayor Shailesh Kumar Sah said the municipality is only responsible for providing food, accommodation and treatment for those in the quarantine. “How nineteen people escaped the facility amid high security is something the security personnel will have to answer,” said Sah.However, Saptari police said their personnel were also unaware of such an incident until Thursday morning. “There were only 53 Indian nationals in the quarantine when we conducted a headcount in the morning. That’s when we realised that 19 had gone missing over the night,” said Tilak Bharati, deputy superintendent of police in Saptari, adding that they are searching for the missing.The Post tried to contact Sagir Rain, a sub-inspector deployed at the Area Police Office in Bhardaha, but he was not available for comment. Bhardaha police have been guarding the quarantine facility. On Friday, the District Police Office recalled Rain and four other police personnel and deputed a new sub-inspector to the facility.

"Four police personnel, three locals injured in clash over distribution of essentials","Four police personnel and three locals were injured on Monday after members of the public clashed with police over distribution of relief materials to households affected by the Covid-19 crisis in Siraha.The incident at Mirchaiya Municipality Ward No.8 took place as 200 people from impoverished households sought relief from the ward office, but found their names excluded on the list of beneficiaries, said Santu Jaisawal, Deputy Superintendent of Police at the Area Police Office, Mirchaiya. Jaiswal said that police personnel were forced to fire tear gas and warning shots in the air to prevent and ensure law and order. “The four police personnel and three locals have sustained minor injuries.” The ward office distributed essentials to 276 impoverished families on its list on Monday. Ward chair Ram Kumar Yadav said that the 200 families not on the list will also receive supplies soon. “There are 200 households not on the list. But we will distribute relief materials to them also, soon.” The ward office distributed 12 kg rice, one kg pulses, a packet of salt, soya chunks and cooking oil to the impoverished families as relief. Rameshwor Yadav, a local of Mirchaiya whose name was not on the list, said, “We are suffering, so we had to resort to protests when our names were not on the list. The security personnel forced us out from the ward office when we started protesting.” Locals and security personnel also clashed during relief distribution at Sukhipur Municipality Ward No. 2 on Sunday. The agitated locals had pelted stones at the ward office alleging that the people’s representatives distributed relief materials only to better-off families. Police had to resort to baton-charging them to take the situation under control. In Chakraghatta Rural Municipality, Sarlahi, too locals staged a sit-in in front of the District Administration Office on Monday saying that they too have been deprived of relief supplies. Ram Kailash Ram, a local of Padariya, said, “There are 500 households in the ward, including 40 households of Chamars. We are yet to receive relief from the ward office even when all other families have received it. Those who have plenty of food grains also received relief. That’s why we are protesting.”Ram, along with his neighbours, had been organising a sit-in in front of the rural municipal office for the last one week. According to Ram, they went to the District Administration Office on Monday as their concerns were not addressed by the rural municipal office. In Samsi Rural Municipality, Mahottari, locals demonstrated outside the mayor’s office demanding essential supplies. Many in Samsi have been struggling to make a living in the wake of the coronavirus crisis, as the government imposed a lockdown.On Monday, agitated locals encircled the local unit’s office, accusing it of failing to provide essential supplies even after 40 days since the lockdown began. The local unit had previously promised locals it would provide supplies relief and collected the names of residents in dire need of relief. The local unit hasn’t kept its promise.The rural municipality had disbursed Rs 1 million to each ward to buy relief supplies, according to Shesh Faruk, rural municipality chief. The wards, however, distributed masks and sanitisers, instead of food. Om Prakash Thakur in Sarlahi and Santosh Singh in Mahottari contributed reporting.  Frequently asked questions about the coronavirus outbreakUPDATED as of September 22, 2020What is Covid-19?Covid-19, short for coronavirus disease, is an illness caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, short for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Common symptoms of the disease include fever, dry cough, fatigue, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In severe cases, the infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. How contagious is Covid-19?Covid-19 can spread easily from person to person, especially in enclosed spaces. The virus can travel through the air in respiratory droplets produced when a sick person breathes, talks, coughs or sneezes. As the virus can also survive on plastic and steel surfaces for up to 72 hours and on cardboard for up to 24 hours, any contact with such surfaces can also spread the virus. Symptoms take between two to 14 days to appear, during which time the carrier is believed to be contagious.Where did the virus come from?The virus was first identified in Wuhan, China in late December. The coronavirus is a large family of viruses that is responsible for everything from the common cold to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). After an initial outbreak in Wuhan that spread across Hubei province, eventually infecting over 80,000 and killing more than 3,000, new infection rates in mainland China have dropped. However, the disease has since spread across the world at an alarming rate.   What is the current status of Covid-19?The World Health Organisation has called the ongoing outbreak a “pandemic” and urged countries across the world to take precautionary measures. Covid-19 has spread to 213 countries and territories around the world and infected more than 31,405,983 people with 967,505 deaths and 22,990,260 recoveries. In South Asia, India has reported the highest number of infections at 5,557,573 with 88,943 deaths. While Pakistan has reported 306,304 confirmed cases with 6,420 deaths. Nepal has so far reported 65,276 cases with 427 deaths.How dangerous is the disease?The mortality rate for Covid-19 is estimated to be 3.6 percent, but new studies have put the rate slightly higher at 5.7 percent. Although Covid-19 is not too dangerous to young healthy people, older individuals and those with immune-compromised systems are at greater risk of death. People with chronic medical conditions like heart disease, diabetes and lung disease, or those who’ve recently undergone serious medical procedures, are also at risk. How do I keep myself safe?The WHO advises that the most important thing you can do is wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizers with at least 60 percent alcohol content. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unclean hands. Clean and disinfect frequently used surfaces like your computers and phones. Avoid large crowds of people. Seek medical attention if symptoms persist for longer than a few days.Is it time to panic?No. The government has imposed a lockdown to limit the spread of the virus. There is no need to begin stockpiling food, cooking gas or hand sanitizers. However, it is always prudent to take sensible precautions like the ones identified above.","Published at : May 4, 2020",Siraha,Bharat Jarghamagar
Death toll reportedly caused by consuming toxic moonshine in Mahottari reaches 12,"The death toll reportedly caused by the consumption of toxic moonshine in two adjoining settlements of Mahottari district reached 12 on Sunday. Rupnarayan Singh Danuwar of Bhangaha Municipality Ward No. 7 died on Sunday morning.Authorities have dispatched three health teams in the affected area after the reported deaths at Meghnath Gorhanna settlement of Bhangaha and Ahiman village of Bardibas Municipality in the past six days. Health workers, security officers and the people’s representatives suspect that the victims might have died of consuming excessive hooch. However, the cause of the death will be confirmed only after the viscera test report comes out.Authorities had collected the viscera samples of the deceased and sent them to the forensic science laboratory of Nepal Police in Kathmandu to be tested on Friday. “We are waiting for the viscera report. All the deceased had drunk locally brewed alcohol and had suffered from similar health complications before dying. We are looking into other possible reasons behind the deaths as well,” Girendra Jha, the health officer at the district public health office in Mahottari, told the Post.All the deceased had similar complaints—stomach ache, diarrhoea and vomiting. Two other locals with similar symptoms are receiving treatment at the Janakpur-based Provincial Hospital. Health teams from the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division under the federal health ministry, BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences in Dharan and the District Public Health Office in Mahottari reached the site to probe the cause behind the deaths. They also examined the health of the deceased’s family members and their neighbours in both the settlements.  “We are inquiring with the deceased’s family members on what they had consumed before their deaths and the health symptoms they showed,” said Dr Amrit Pokharel of the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. The lab report will confirm the cause of the death, he added.With the death of 12 people since Tuesday, the locals have demanded authorities to conduct Covid-19 tests on the settlements’ residents, as they suspect coronavirus to be the cause behind the deaths.On Saturday, a team of health officials conducted rapid diagnostic tests on two of the 12 dead brought to the district hospital for postmortem; both the reports came negative. The team has also collected their nasal swab to conduct a test through the Polymerase Chain Reaction method.Shyamkrishna Adhikari, the superintendent of police in Mahottari, said, “We have been informed that the viscera, PCR and postmortem reports will come by Monday.”Eight of the deceased are from Meghnath Gorhanna settlement in Bhangaha and four others from Ahiman. “The deceased first complained of abdominal ache followed by diarrhoea and vomiting. They died on their way to nearby health institutions,” said Sanjib Sah, mayor of Bhangaha.All the deceased were from impoverished families who were hit hardest by the lockdown enforced to prevent the outbreak of Covid-19. On Sunday, the Mahottari Police informed the Province 2 government about its preliminary investigation. According to Adhikari, most of the deceased had only eaten chiura (beaten rice) before consuming alcohol in excess. The investigation found that the deceased had bought hooch from a local liquor shop. Police have also collected the sample of the alcohol consumed by the deceased for testing.","Published at : May 4, 2020",Janakpur/mahottari,Ajit Tiwari						 &
11 people in Mahottari reportedly died of consuming toxic alcohol in five days,"Authorities on Friday collected the viscera of 11 people who died in two adjoining settlements of Mahottari district in the past five days. The deceased, aged 26 to 55, reportedly died of consuming toxic moonshine at Meghnath Gorhanna settlement of Bhangaha Municipality and Ahiman village of Bardibas Municipality.“The viscera samples were collected and sent to the forensic science laboratory of Nepal Police in Kathmandu to be tested. The report will confirm the cause behind the death of the 11 people,” said Dhiraj Pratap Singh, the deputy inspector general of police at Province 2. Security personnel have started monitoring the production, sale and consumption of locally brewed alcohol in the region. On Saturday, Palat Sah, 48, and 55-year-old Motilal Prajapati, an Indian national, died at Ward No. 6 of Bhangaha. According to the locals, they had consumed alcohol the previous day and died after they suffered from stomach ache, diarrhoea and vomiting.The bodies of five people who had died in the two settlements on Tuesday and Wednesday were cremated before the police could take them to a hospital for postmortem. The villagers performed their final rites thinking they had died of natural causes. However, as more people started dying, security personnel intervened and took the bodies of two persons who died on Thursday to Jaleshwor Hospital for postmortem. “The villagers did not inform us at first, thinking those men had died of natural causes. However, as more death reports came forward, we took the bodies to a hospital for postmortem,” said DIG Singh.All the deceased were from impoverished families who were hit hardest by the lockdown enforced to prevent the outbreak of Covid-19. According to Shyam Krishna Adhikari, the superintendent of police in Mahottari, preliminary investigation shows that the deceased had excessively consumed alcohol before their deaths. “Detailed investigation is underway to find other possible causes as well,” he said. The Mahottari Police has also collected the sample of the locally brewed alcohol from the settlements for laboratory tests.The people’s representatives of the local units also suspect toxic moonshine to be the cause behind the deaths. “The deceased people were found to be fine the previous day. They had excessively consumed alcohol before they went to bed,” said Sanjib Sah, mayor of Bhangaha Municipality.With the death of 11 people in the past five days, the locals are in abject terror as they suspect coronavirus to be the cause of the deaths. They have demanded authorities to conduct Covid-19 tests in their locality. On Saturday, a team of health officials conducted rapid diagnostic tests of two people for coronavirus, but both the reports came negative. The team also collected their nasal swab for PCR test. “The villagers were fearful about a possible outbreak of coronavirus, but the reports were negative. The rapid tests of the bodies taken to the hospital for postmortem were also negative,” said Adhikari.The local administration on Saturday dispatched health teams in the affected settlements. Federal Education Minister Girirajmani Pokharel also visited the area on Friday and Saturday and inquired about the situation.The production, sale and consumption of illegally brewed alcohol are unchecked in Province 2. Incidents of death caused by toxic hooch are frequent in various districts of the province. As many as 15 people died after consuming toxic alcohol in Ramdaiya of Dhanusha district in March.","Published at : May 3, 2020",Janakpur/mahottari,Ajit Tiwari						 &

Saptari in short supply of Rapid Diagnostic Test kits,"The Saptari district health authority has run short of rapid diagnostic test kits for surveillance of suspected coronavirus patients.The District Health Office said on Thursday that it will no longer be conducting rapid antibody tests on people entering the district. The district had received 960 test kits and 160 units of them were issued to Gajendra Narayan Singh Hospital in Rajbiraj. The District Health Office has so far performed 760 rapid tests on individuals staying in various quarantine facilities. The hospital, meanwhile, had run 120 tests as of Wednesday.“The whole district has only 30 rapid test kits left. We will have to halt the rapid tests from Friday,” said Duniyalal Yadav, chief at the District Health Office. “We have already informed the provincial government about the shortage.” The district has been seeing a huge influx of people coming for tests. With a limited number of kits, the health office has decided to halt the test for the time being. Migrant workers from Qatar, Malaysia, Dubai and Saudi Arabia before the lockdown as well as those people who were stuck in Kathmandu are returning in droves, but the district health office has no resources to test them for possible infection.  “We have Gulf returnees coming home and we need to perform rapid tests on all of them to check for infection,” Yadav said. On Wednesday alone, more than 100 individuals entered Saptari and among them 30 were sent to Gajendra Narayan Singh Hospital for rapid testing.Dr Chumanlal Das, the medical superintendent at the hospital, said all 30 tests results were negative. “The remaining others have been sent to quarantine facilities in their respective local units,” said Das. Meanwhile, the District Health Office is also running short of other essential medical gear such as gowns, masks and gloves. “We will soon run out of sanitisers and personal protective equipment too,” said Yadav. Although the provincial government had recently announced to send a Polymerase Chain Reaction machine to Saptari to conduct tests, the local administration is yet to decide where to set up the machine. “The discussions are ongoing to set up a lab. The possible locations are the District Health Office building, Gajendra Narayan Singh Hospital, Gajendra Narayan Singh Industrial Area or Sai Krishna Medical College,” said Yadav. For the time being, the swab samples collected in Saptari are being sent to Dharan-based BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences for PCR tests. On Wednesday, a team of Women, Children and Social Justice Committee of the provincial assembly inspected Gajendra Narayan Singh Hospital, District Health Office and Bhardaha Hospital and took stock of the situation. Anul Rain, chairman of the committee, said they had inspected the health institutions to assess the situation. “We have been informed about the shortage of rapid test kits and other essential medical equipment.

Eleven others, including five ward chairpersons of the sub-metropolis, had also been detained at different times earlier for their alleged involvement in the incident.The District Police Office in Bara investigated the incident on black marketeering charges and submitted its report to the Office of District Attorney.

Mahottari sees rise in illegal mining of construction aggregate during lockdown,"Illegal sand and stone mining has increased in Mahottari ever since the government issued nationwide lockdown orders to prevent the spread of Covid-19. While the authorities are involved in Covid-19 response and relief works, smugglers are busy extracting sand and stones from rivers and streams.   At Maraha stream, smugglers have been extracting sand and stones despite the District Court’s injunction that has banned mining of construction aggregate, locals said. “Smugglers are extracting riverbed materials from the stream during the night,” said a Maraha local. “They are using excavators and vehicles even though there is a lockdown.” On Thursday, two journalists from the Annapurna Post daily were threatened by the smugglers for taking a video and collecting news about illegal excavation of riverbed materials in the Maraha stream. “A group of sand smugglers encircled us when we started to take the photos and video. They threatened us not to disseminate the news,” said Rajkaran Mahato, one of the journalists. The smugglers reportedly fled when a team of security personnel reached the scene.Kamalesh Mandal, chairman of Mahottari chapter of the Federation of Nepali Journalists, said that threatening journalists while reporting news is against press freedom. “We demand the police administration to stop the illegal excavation and take action against the people who threatened journalists,” said Mandal. Two months ago, Gaushala Municipality had awarded a contract of Rs 1.5 million to extract riverbed materials to Anish Construction Janakpur. However, the District Court in Mahottari had directed to stop the excavation of the stream for the time being after it was discovered that the contractor did not complete the contract process. Ranjit Kumar Barma, information officer at municipal office, said aggregate mining at the stream had been banned following the court’s order. “We have also informed local administration, the District Police Office and the contractor about the ban,” said Barma.Shivanath Mahato, the municipal mayor, said he was unaware of the mining taking place in the stream.“We had informed the contractor only to carry out excavation works after receiving the court's order. If the contractor has defied the court’s order, we will initiate necessary action,” said Mahato.","Published at : April 23, 2020",Mahottari,Sunita Baral

PCR machine was sent to Narayani Hospital without supplementary equipment,"A Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) machine provided by the Province 2 government to Narayani Hospital on Wednesday remains unused. According to the hospital administration, the machine has not come into use due to the unavailability of supportive equipment required to operate the machine.Following the identification of three Covid-19 cases in Birgunj on Sunday, residents and people’s representatives raised their voices to start PCR tests in the district. But Dr Madan Kumar Upadhyay, medical superintendent of the hospital, said that health personnel cannot run tests in the lab with the PCR machine alone. “The PCR machine needs other supportive equipment for operation. We haven’t received them yet,” said Upadhyay. According to Upadhyay, four to five equipment, including biosafety cabinets, are required to operate the machine. On conditions of anonymity, one of the physicians at the hospital said that the National Public Health Laboratory, where the PCR machine was kept, did not send a biosafety cabinet, centrifuge machine, vortex machine, pipette set and other equipment required to operate the PCR machine. Additionally, doctors at the hospital say a larger space is required to set up a laboratory that can safely run tests without compromising the results. “We need separate rooms to keep the specimens that bear different results. For now, we don’t have the capacity to do that,” said the physician.“The hospital will not be able to bear the expenses of establishing a laboratory to conduct PCR tests,” said Upadhyay. Currently, rapid diagnostic tests are being conducted on Covid-19 suspects in Birgunj. Swab samples of those individuals are being sent to the Coronavirus Testing Laboratory in Hetauda. According to Upadhyay, 44 swab samples have been sent to the Kathmandu-based National Public Health Laboratory for tests due to an overload in Hetauda’s lab.  Frequently asked questions about the coronavirus outbreakUPDATED as of September 22, 2020What is Covid-19?Covid-19, short for coronavirus disease, is an illness caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, short for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

As the virus can also survive on plastic and steel surfaces for up to 72 hours and on cardboard for up to 24 hours, any contact with such surfaces can also spread the virus. Symptoms take between two to 14 days to appear, during which time the carrier is believed to be contagious.Where did the virus come from?The virus was first identified in Wuhan, China in late December. The coronavirus is a large family of viruses that is responsible for everything from the common cold to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). After an initial outbreak in Wuhan that spread across Hubei province, eventually infecting over 80,000 and killing more than 3,000, new infection rates in mainland China have dropped. However, the disease has since spread across the world at an alarming rate.   What is the current status of Covid-19?The World Health Organisation has called the ongoing outbreak a “pandemic” and urged countries across the world to take precautionary measures. Covid-19 has spread to 213 countries and territories around the world and infected more than 31,405,983 people with 967,505 deaths and 22,990,260 recoveries. In South Asia, India has reported the highest number of infections at 5,557,573 with 88,943 deaths. While Pakistan has reported 306,304 confirmed cases with 6,420 deaths. Nepal has so far reported 65,276 cases with 427 deaths.How dangerous is the disease?The mortality rate for Covid-19 is estimated to be 3.6 percent, but new studies have put the rate slightly higher at 5.7 percent. Although Covid-19 is not too dangerous to young healthy people, older individuals and those with immune-compromised systems are at greater risk of death. People with chronic medical conditions like heart disease, diabetes and lung disease, or those who’ve recently undergone serious medical procedures, are also at risk. How do I keep myself safe?The WHO advises that the most important thing you can do is wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizers with at least 60 percent alcohol content. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unclean hands. Clean and disinfect frequently used surfaces like your computers and phones. Avoid large crowds of people. Seek medical attention if symptoms persist for longer than a few days.Is it time to panic?No. The government has imposed a lockdown to limit the spread of the virus. There is no need to begin stockpiling food, cooking gas or hand sanitizers. However, it is always prudent to take sensible precautions like the ones identified above.","Published at : April 19, 2020",Birgunj,Bhusan Yadav
Province 2 writes to federal government not to transfer top security officials without its consent,"The Province 2 government has written to the federal government not to transfer top security officers based in the province without consulting it.In its letter to the Ministry of Home Affairs sent on Friday, the provincial Ministry of Internal Affairs and Law said that the federal government should transfer or deploy top security officers only after consulting the provincial government. “New security chiefs take time to acquaint themselves. It will be wise not to transfer them in the present situation,” said Gyanendra Kumar Yadav, minister of Internal Affairs and Law. He said the security officers have a great role to play in mitigating the risk of the spread of coronavirus. Yadav’s comments come as the one-year tenure of three deputy inspectors general, some chief district officers and Superintendents of Police working in Province-2 comes to an end soon .The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Law has also notified the Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers, Nepal Police, Armed Police Force and the National Investigation Department about the letter. Yadav said that top security officials shall only be transferred only if the provincial government accepts their posting. Currently, Deputy Inspectors General Pradhumna Karki and Tekendra Karki of Nepal Police and Raju Aryal of the Armed Police Force are deployed in the province. Their one- year tenure in the province is going to be completed soon.

"Families of daily wage earners, impoverished Dalit communities in Province 2 deprived of reliefs even after three weeks of nationwide lockdown","Jagadish Mahato of Gair in Kabilasi Municipality, Sarlahi, is the sole bread earner for his 12-member family—his wife and 10 children. The nationwide lockdown has put him out of work for the past three weeks. His savings, in cash and kind, is already spent. “I’ve been borrowing food and cash from local shopkeepers, neighbours and relatives,” said Jagadish. “But how long can this go on for?”Hundreds of families from impoverished communities in several districts of Province 2 are hit hardest by the protracted lockdown enforced to prevent the outbreak of Covid-19. The breadwinners of these families are daily wage workers and they have lost their source of income due to the lockdown, making it difficult for them to make ends meet. The authorities concerned are yet to reach out to these settlements with reliefs.To provide relief to the families hit hardest by the lockdown, the provincial government had provided Rs 1 million to Rs 2.5 million to each local unit for the procurement and distribution of relief. However, it has been more than three weeks since the lockdown started and most of the local bodies are yet to implement the budget.“I am more worried about how to fill out stomachs than contracting the disease right now. I heard the government is providing relief through the local bodies, but nobody has come to our settlement so far,” said Mahato. Most of the local units in all eight districts of the province have spent the last three weeks assessing data of those in need of government relief. Incidents of irregularities and biases in relief distribution are frequently reported, leaving the destitute people without any government help. There are a total of 136 local units, including a metropolis, in the province.Officials at Kabilashi Municipality in Sarlahi have admitted to the delay in relief distribution. “We are still assessing data of the needy families to distribute relief. We have been unable to work efficiently due to a lack of employees in the municipality,” said Mayor Kaushal Kishwor Yadav.Janakpur Sub-metropolitan City, the provincial capital, has also yet to begin relief distribution. According to Gopal Regmi, the chief administrative officer of the sub-metropolis, only 12 wards of a total of 25 have sent their list of beneficiaries so far. He said the sub-metropolis has decided to provide a relief package of 15 kg rice, 1.5 kg pulses, 3 kg potatoes and 1 kg salt to each affected household in the first phase. “The packages could not be distributed as the ward chiefs failed to submit the list of the beneficiaries on time,” he said.In Rautahat, Chandrapur Municipality has decided to provide 20 kg rice along with other essentials to each household of daily wage workers and impoverished Dalits. But the municipality has so far distributed relief at ward No. 3 only. “The relief distribution got halted because people from well-to-do families also came forward claiming the relief package. We will soon finalise the list of beneficiaries and start distribution again,” said Sanjaya Kafle, chief of ward No. 5 in the municipality.“The local units should work promptly in distributing relief to the needy. But the people’s representatives have shown poor management and leadership qualities in these difficult times,” said Raj Kumar Raut Kurmi, a civil society leader in Siraha.In Aahale of Siraha, there are 21 impoverished families of landless Musahars, and none of them has received any relief from the government so far. Sixty-year-old Sudawa Musahar and his wife Devi, daily wage workers, said they haven’t had work since the lockdown started and are running out of food and essentials.“We are managing food by borrowing from neighbours but if the lockdown continues, we might face starvation,” Sudawa told the Post.

Woman dies in stampede following clash between police and locals in Saptari,"An elderly woman died in a stampede following a clash between police personnel and the locals in Birpur of Saptari district on Monday. The incident occurred as security personnel were taking action against the locals who defied the ongoing nationwide lockdown and gathered in the market place.Jainab Khatun of Khadak Municipality Ward No.6 collapsed in the street when the crowd began running amok amid police’s crackdown. She was taken to Sagarmatha Zonal Hospital where she died in the course of treatment. Her body is kept at the hospital for postmortem.Khatun’s relatives claimed that she died due to the highhandedness of the security personnel. The Area Police Office in Kalyanpur, however, said the victim was a high blood pressure patient and that might have caused her death. Mohammad Ekbal, a ward member of Khadka Municipality, said Khatun lost consciousness when the crowd started running and did not come to when the police started baton charging. “Khatun fell unconscious but the police kept on baton charging,” said Ekbal. Khatun’s sisters-in-law, Chunni and Kabulan, who also sustained injuries in the incident, said policemen mercilessly baton-charged women in the market place. Chunni and Kabulan are receiving treatment at a local hospital in Kalyanpur. Tilak Bharati, deputy superintendent of police at the District Police Office in Saptari, said they are investigating the incident. “We can comment on the incident only after we carry out a detailed investigation,” said Bharati. Meanwhile, a scuffle ensued between security forces deployed at the border point in Siraha Municipality and locals of Mahuliya in Bihar, India on Monday. A group of locals from Mauhilya attacked Armed Police Force (APF) personnel when the latter prevented an Indian national from entering Nepal through the border point.

Grocery store in Bara sealed on charge of selling substandard goods,"Kalaiya Sub-metropolitan City on Saturday sealed a grocery store after it was found to be selling substandard lentils that were left unsold for years. Yadav Cold Store, located at Ward No. 7 of the sub-metropolis, is owned by Nepali Congress leader and former MP Radhechandra Yadav, and is operated by his son, Rajesh Raya, who is the mayor of the sub-metropolis.Police sealed the store after they received numerous complaints from locals. The lentils distributed were allegedly unsold for four years, police said.The sub-metropolis has confiscated 9,500 kg of lentils from the store and collected the sample for further investigation, according to Chief District Officer Rudra Prasad Pandit. “We will send the sample to be tested at the Regional Food Technology and Quality Control Office in Hetauda on Sunday,” he said.The same lentil was bought by Ward N0. 1 office to distribute as relief to those affected by the lockdown.DSP Gautam Mishra of Bara Police said the store owner had sold the lentil on credit to the office of ward number 1. “The owner tried to trick the buyer amid rumours of food shortage in the lockdown,” Mishra said.However, Mayor Raya has claimed that the substandard lentil distributed as relief material was not purchased from his store. “The goods were bought from a retailer who is currently out of contact,” he said but refused to name the retailer.Chief of Ward No.1 Hariom Sah, however, said his office had recently purchased lentils and potatoes from Raya’s store. “We purchased six quintals of lentils and 34 quintals of potato from Yadav’s store,” he said.Chair of Bara Chamber of Commerce Binod Sah has called on the district administration to punish the perpetrators. “Goods stored for years are now found to be sold at exorbitant prices,” he said. “Entrepreneurs involved in this inhumane activity should be punished.”A similar case was reported on Friday in Nawalparasi, where locals returned substandard foodstuffs provided to them as relief.","Published at : April 12, 2020",Bara,Laxmi Sah
Saptari disaster committee prioritises security forces over health facilities,"The Saptari district disaster management committee has distributed half of the money it received from the provincial government to fight the coronavirus epidemic to security agencies at a time when local health facilities are reeling under a budget crunch.Of the Rs 5 million provided by the Province 2 government, Rs 2.6 million has been given to Nepal Army, Nepal Police, Armed Police Force and National Investigation Department units based in the district.The committee headed by the chief district officer has provided just Rs 100,000 each to the District Public Health Office and Gajendra Narayan Singh Hospital to set up isolation wards.“We haven’t been able to provide personal protective equipment to health workers who have been deployed to control Covid-19 in the district due to lack of money,” said Duniya Lal Yadav, chief at the District Public Health Office in Saptari. “Some of the quarantine facilities in different parts of the district do not have basic equipment like thermal guns,” he added. “The health office should provide security gear to employees deployed in the field. But we haven’t been able to purchase any due to the lack of budget,” he added. According to him, the government provided the office Rs 500,000 to launch awareness campaigns and an additional Rs 500,000 to purchase medicines and equipment. But the amount is not enough.According to the District Public Health Office, quarantine facilities in Dakneshwori, Shambhunath, Khadaga, Rupani, Rajgadh and Chhinnamasta do not even have thermal guns. “The health workers have been using a digital thermometer to measure body temperature of the quarantined people there,” said Duniya Lal.The money was provided to the security forces despite the government’s separate provisioning of Rs 4.5 million to Nepal Police, Armed Police Force and National Investigation Department of the province under.According to Saptari Chief District Officer Sunil Khanal, Bhimdal Battalion of Nepal Army, the District Police Office and Armed Police Battalion 6, Rajbiraj have been provided Rs 700,000 each while Nepal Police Training Centre and Armed Police Force Battalion in Barmajhiya provided Rs 200,000 each. Similarly, the National Investigation Office in Saptari was provided Rs 100,000.Khanal claimed that the amount was distributed as per the decision of the disaster management committee. “The amount was provided to security agencies to buy equipment and for the mobilisation of the security personnel in the field,” he added.People’s representatives, political parties and even some members of the district disaster management committee have raised questions over the amount provided to security agencies by ignoring the health sector.Ashok Kumar Mandal, Saptari chairman of Nepal Communist Party, and Nepal Congress district president Dinesh Kumar Yadav, both members of the district disaster management committee, condemned the move. Both of them said that they were not consulted with while distributing the amount. “We were not even informed about the meeting of the disaster management committee. The chief district officer and the chiefs of the security agencies decided unilaterally,” said Mandal. Meanwhile, police detained 25 people, including 14 Indian nationals, who refused to stay in quarantine. Security personnel detained them in Bhardaha, Saptari on Wednesday evening and have kept them in a quarantine in Mahuli. Investigation is on to find out from where they entered Saptari, said police.","Published at : April 11, 2020",Rajbiraj,Abdhesh Kumar Jha
Birgunj border customs officials face shortage of mask and gowns,"Although the Department of Customs has made it compulsory for staffers at border customs offices to wear masks, along with other protective equipment amid Covid 19 threats, officials at the Birgunj customs say they don’t have enough protective wear to comply with the order.In a guideline issued on Tuesday, the Department of Customs ordered officials to make provisions for full-body covers, goggles, rubber gloves and surgical or N95 masks for the staff. The customs offices have been told to procure the safety gear locally.On Monday, the customs office, which needs around 125 masks a day for its staffers, purchased 300 masks locally. “But, getting masks in the market has been the biggest problem here,” said Dhundi Niraula, chief customs officer at Birgunj customs. “I am struggling to find masks to give to my staffers masks on Wednesday now.”Niraula said that the customs office has not found full-body covers in the market and it has no option but to use whatever dress is available in the market. Staffers of border customs offices continue to work even during the lockdown to ensure vital supplies of goods including food items and medical equipment. But, the government has been slow to introduce measures to prevent the spread of the contagious disease from incoming vehicles.Although the customs department had earlier told customs offices to make it compulsory for staffers to wear a mask, gown and gloves, a detailed guideline was issued only on Tuesday, more than two weeks after the government enforced nationwide the lockdown on March 24 to prevent the spread of the disease. As per the new safety guidelines, customs officials need to check customs clearance documents only in scanned formats, and not on paper. The department has asked customs staffers to not touch their eyes, nose and mouth while working and take a shower before going home.The guideline has also asked customs offices to disinfect both vehicles and goods, including food items such as vegetables and fruits.The department has asked offices to allow vehicles to leave customs only 12 hours after their arrival. Shishir Ghimire, information officer at the Department of Customs admitted that the disinfection measures were introduced only after the lockdown was enforced. “Only trucks carrying goods and cabins occupied by drivers are being disinfected,” Ghimire told the Post on Tuesday.According to Ghimire, disinfection measures were not implemented earlier because the Covid 19 pandemic was not as wide-spread in India. A truck reaches Nepal after a long journey and the virus would have died on the way, he said. The delay in the issuance of the guidelines is one of the reasons why export-import through Rasuwagadhi and Tatopani customs offices on the border with China is not taking place even two weeks after the government decided to reopen the border crossing closed after the Covid 19 pandemic began in China in last year.The government on March 25 decided to reopen the border crossings with China only for goods by following a strict health protocol. After it did not receive the health protocol, the Tatopani customs office had last week requested the government to do it at the earliest. “We received a set of guidelines only on Tuesday, but we are yet to receive protocols from the health ministry,” said Lal Bahadur Khatri, chief customs officer at Tatopani customs.","Published at : April 9, 2020",Kathmandu,Prithvi Man Shrestha

According to him, the hunters left a musket in the forest as they fled.“We have increased forest patrolling in recent days, as more poachers and timber smugglers might enter the forests during the lockdown. Some locals might also enter the forests to hunt wild animals,” said Binod Singh, chief at the Division Forest Office.The poachers generally target deer, wild boars, blue bulls, rabbits and various species of birds. They are usually active in the dry months between March and May, and some even set forests on fire to trap wild animals, says Singh. Poaching and smuggling of timber have gone unchecked in several forests of the district in recent years. The incidents of poaching are often reported in Chocha, Chandrapur, Gaidatar, Rangapur, Balari, among other areas of Rautahat.","Published at : April 9, 2020",Rautahat,Shiva Puri
Nepali Congress Bara chapter contributes Rs 4.75 million to coronavirus prevention fund set up by Province 2 government,"The Bara district chapter of Nepali Congress has handed over the relief amount meant for last year’s windstorm survivors to the Coronavirus Infection Prevention, Control and Treatment Fund established by the Province 2 government.The party had collected Rs 4.75 million to help the families affected by the windstorm in Bara and Parsa districts on March 31, 2019. Jayachandra Chaurasiya, the Bara district president of Nepali Congress, said the party on Monday handed over the cheque for Rs 4.75 million to Chief Minister Lal Babu Raut so that the amount can be used for Covid-19 preparedness and response.“The amount was collected to provide relief to the windstorm victims. For that, the central office of the Nepali Congress had provided Rs 2.5 million, party’s lawmakers and leaders of district committees had collected the remaining amount. We handed over the amount to Raut,” Chaurasiya said. The cheque handover was made in presence of Ramsaroj Raya Yadav, the Nepali Congress parliamentary party leader of Province 2.“Our party had collected the amount to help the windstorm victims. But since Nepal Army had already taken the initiative to resettle the families rendered homeless by the disaster, we decided to divert the amount to fight coronavirus,” Yadav said. The party had decided to hand over the amount to the Coronavirus Infection Prevention, Control and Treatment Fund after discussing with all district presidents and the central party office, Chaurasiya said. Meanwhile, some district leaders of the Nepali Congress have disapproved of the party’s decision to hand over the fund meant for windstorm survivors to help the provincial government in its fight against coronavirus. “The amount was collected to resettle the windstrom victims. But, the amount was handed over to the Chief Minister without making a decision at the district level,” Manoj Bhatta, a district leader of Nepali Congress in Bara, said. Leaders in support of the decision have contended that since the fund was lying unused, the party was correct to divert the fund to test and treat Covid-19 patients in the province.The Province 2 government had formed the Coronavirus Infection Prevention, Control and Treatment Fund on March 31. The government established the treatment fund with Rs 250 million seed money to facilitate efforts to control the spread of the coronavirus. According to Minister for Internal Affairs and Law Gyanendra Kumar Yadav, provincial ministers have agreed to contribute their one month’s salary to the fund. “The fund will be used to mitigate the risk and also be used to provide relief to those affected by the pandemic,” he said.So far, Rs 13.6 million has been deposited in the fund, which has helped the authorities in taking different measures to control the possible spread of coronavirus. According to the data of the Ministry of Social Development, 869 people have been kept in quarantine in various districts.

Quarantine centre set up by Province 2 government in Dhanusa lacks basic facilities,"The 250-bed quarantine facility set up by Nepali Army at Ganguli in Dhanusa currently has 19 people, all of them returnees from India and Qatar.But the facility, set up at the behest of the Province 2 government, is ill-equipped to function effectively, says Ashok Thakur, a health assistant deployed at the facility. According to Thakur, the place lacks even the basic facilities like running water and soap. “We are living in tents. We don’t have any protective gear and the medical equipment to conduct health check-ups of the quarantined patients. The only protection we have are face masks, that’s all,” he said. There are 11 health workers, 14 Nepal Army soldiers, one Assistant Sub Inspector from Nepal Police and one Assistant Sub Inspector from Armed Police Force deployed at the facility. None of them has personal protective equipment. “There’s no management of health and safety at the facility. We have been put on duty to save lives but we can only do so if we can protect ourselves first,” said one security personnel from Nepal Army. On Friday morning, a team led by Gopal Regmi, chief executive officer of Janakpudham Sub Metropolis, inspected the facility and assured to provide water supply, soaps and sanitisers. “There's a shortage of face masks. There are no buckets, soaps and hand sanitisers here,” Regmi said. “The Sub Metropolis will immediately take steps to manage these items.” The Nepal Army has been providing meals to the quarantined people. Captain Subid Basnet said the soldiers deployed at the facility were at risk because they did not have any protective gear. “The soldiers who are feeding the people in quarantine don’t have Personal Protective Equipment. They have to go near the quarantined people but have nothing to protect them from the possible infection,'' he said. The people staying in quarantine, too, are not pleased with the management, or lack thereof, of the facility. “It doesn’t feel safe here. There’s not enough water in the taps to wash our hands. I feel my health is more compromised here than it would be if I was staying at my own house,” sad a 34-year-old quarantine patient. “There’s no internet, no TV, no books and papers.

As the virus can also survive on plastic and steel surfaces for up to 72 hours and on cardboard for up to 24 hours, any contact with such surfaces can also spread the virus. Symptoms take between two to 14 days to appear, during which time the carrier is believed to be contagious.Where did the virus come from?The virus was first identified in Wuhan, China in late December. The coronavirus is a large family of viruses that is responsible for everything from the common cold to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). After an initial outbreak in Wuhan that spread across Hubei province, eventually infecting over 80,000 and killing more than 3,000, new infection rates in mainland China have dropped. However, the disease has since spread across the world at an alarming rate.   What is the current status of Covid-19?The World Health Organisation has called the ongoing outbreak a “pandemic” and urged countries across the world to take precautionary measures. Covid-19 has spread to 213 countries and territories around the world and infected more than 31,405,983 people with 967,505 deaths and 22,990,260 recoveries. In South Asia, India has reported the highest number of infections at 5,557,573 with 88,943 deaths. While Pakistan has reported 306,304 confirmed cases with 6,420 deaths. Nepal has so far reported 65,276 cases with 427 deaths.How dangerous is the disease?The mortality rate for Covid-19 is estimated to be 3.6 percent, but new studies have put the rate slightly higher at 5.7 percent. Although Covid-19 is not too dangerous to young healthy people, older individuals and those with immune-compromised systems are at greater risk of death. People with chronic medical conditions like heart disease, diabetes and lung disease, or those who’ve recently undergone serious medical procedures, are also at risk. How do I keep myself safe?The WHO advises that the most important thing you can do is wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizers with at least 60 percent alcohol content. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unclean hands. Clean and disinfect frequently used surfaces like your computers and phones. Avoid large crowds of people. Seek medical attention if symptoms persist for longer than a few days.Is it time to panic?No. The government has imposed a lockdown to limit the spread of the virus. There is no need to begin stockpiling food, cooking gas or hand sanitizers. However, it is always prudent to take sensible precautions like the ones identified above.","Published at : April 5, 2020",Janakpur,Ajit Tiwari
Rautahat police confiscate ambulances on charge of carrying passengers during lockdown,"The Area Police Office in Chandranigahapur on Saturday confiscated three ambulances that were allegedly carrying passengers along the East West Highway. Of the three ambulances, two are privately owned and one belongs to the Nepal Red Cross Society in Hirapur.Police confiscated one of the ambulances from the Paurahi section of the highway where it was carrying six passengers, police said. Krishna Lama, the driver, admitted to have carried the passengers from Kathmandu to Harion for Rs 12000, according to the police.“We have learned that many ambulances have been carrying passengers instead of patients during the lockdown,” DSP Hem Bahadur Shahi of Rautahat police said. “These are sensitive times and taking advantage of this situation is problematic.” The ambulance, the driver and the passengers are currently in police custody.In another instance, an ambulance owned by the Red Cross Society was found taking passengers from Barthahwa to Birgunj, Shahi said. The driver, Shivakumar Yadav, has denied misusing the vehicle saying the family he was carrying had an emergency as their child was sick in Birgunj.The police have confiscated another ambulance that was also carrying passengers from Nawalpur to Birgunj, and has taken its driver, Raj Mohammed Miya, in custody.“We have noticed a surge of ambulances on the road during the lockdown,” Shahi said.Meanwhile, Rautahat Police have said they are monitoring the movement of ambulances as many are found to be carrying passengers to make quick money.

"Despite strict instructions from the provincial government, private hospitals in province-2 unwilling to provide services","Seven days ago, Sanobabu Sunar, a local of Gauridanda in Mahottari, went to Subhaswastik Hospital in Bardibas after suffering from fever. When he reached the hospital, a security guard deployed at the hospital’s entrance asked Sunar about his health complications before calling a doctor out on the hospital premises.The doctor stood by the door and enquired about Sunar’s health condition; verbally prescribed some medicines and sent him away. “The guard did not allow me to enter the hospital. The doctor asked me to take paracetamols and sent me away without examination,” said Sunar, “I could have very well gone to a pharmacy instead of going to the doctor.” Refuting Sunar’s claims, Dipak Karki, the owner of the hospital says that the hospital has been providing treatment to around 50 to 60 patients on a daily basis. “But the hospital has been admitting patients and performing medical tests only in necessary cases,” said Karki. On Friday, Bijaya Kushwaha, 25, of Kalaiya Sub Metropolis sustained a leg injury while operating a thresher machine. He went to the local pharmacy and got 35 stitches to close his wound. He was taken to the National Medical College, Birgunj after his health condition worsened on Saturday. While in the hospital, Kushwaha developed dry cough and fever on Sunday, but the doctors refused to continue his treatment and referred him to other hospitals. But the hospitals in Birgunj—Narayani, Bayodha and Gandak—also refused to admit him. Since Kushwaha’s family had no other option, they decided to take him to Kathmandu. On Sunday evening, TU Teaching Hospital in Kathmandu pronounced him dead on arrival at the hospital. A majority of cases began surfacing of private hospitals and medical clinics in province-2 refusing to treat patients; especially of those complaining of fever. Following several complaints, Lalbabu Raut, Chief Minister of Province-2, on Tuesday directed all Chief District Officers in eight districts to cancel the registration of such private hospitals. But on Wednesday Nepal Chikitsak Sangh issued a statement in retaliation demanding for the decision to cancel the registration of such hospitals to be repealed. National Medical College, a private hospital in Birgunj, has set-up a 50-bed isolation ward to treat Covid-19 infected patients. But, the hospital has been declining medical treatment of patients due to a lack of Personal Protective Equipment. Dr Madan Upadhayay, medical superintendent of the Narayani Hospital, a government hospital in Birgunj, said private hospitals have been referring patients (suffering from minor fever and cough) to other hospitals fearing novel coronavirus cases. He said, “They are waiting for the government to send medical kits rather than focussing on treating patients.”Voicing their concerns about contracting and spreading novel coronavirus, private hospital owners say they are unwilling to take patients showing Covid-19 like symptoms. “The first symptom of Covid-19 is fever and dry cough,” said the operator of one of the private hospitals in Birgunj, who asked to remain anonymous for privacy reasons. In Rautahat, the District Administration Office has warned private hospitals of action if they fail to take in patients complaining of fever and cough. The administration has received a number of complaints of patients being turned away from private hospitals, says Basudev Ghimire, Chief District Officer of Rautahat. “In the last few days, the administration has been informed about cases wherein private hospitals have referred patients to government hospitals,” he said. “We will take strict action against any hospitals turning patients away.” There are 21 private hospitals in Rautahat district. In Sarlahi, most of the private health facilities have been closed in the wake of the global pandemic. Some of the private hospitals which were operating before the spread of coronavirus are now padlocked. Man Bahadur Khadka, mayor of Lalbandi Municipality, said he submitted a memorandum to Mohan Bahadur GC, Chief District Officer of Sarlahi, to take action against such private hospitals. On Thursday, GC also called operators of private hospitals in his office and requested them to open their hospitals in these trying times.

Covid-19 testing lab yet to come into operation in Janakpur Provincial Hospital,"Tests on coronavirus suspect cases were supposed to start on Tuesday in Janakpur. However, testing is yet to start because there were logistical delays in the Provincial Hospital in Janakpur. A team of doctors from Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital had reached the hospital to set up the lab on Tuesday. The federal government had sent a PCR machine with a team of doctors led by Dr Surendra Madhu from Kathmandu to establish the lab.

Province 2 comes up with relief package for affected people,"The Province 2 government’s relief package for the families affected by the lockdown enforced in the wake of the global Covid-19 outbreak will exclude government officials and any salaried employees as the aid is meant only for the poor, farmers and daily wage workers.The guidelines for relief materials distribution and monitoring for affected groups, endorsed by the provincial government on Tuesday, say the relief will not cover families having any members employed by the government and in the state apparatus, and those who run a business or receive salary or pensions from the government or non-government organisations.“The relief package has been brought only to provide respite for workers—having no income source other than daily wages, the poor and financially marginalised farmers,” Shailendra Prasad Shah, the Province 2 minister for land management, agriculture and cooperatives, told the Post. “Some people who have no jobs are just unemployed; they will also get relief materials.” A committee, under the coordination of the ward chairperson, will lead relief distribution at the local level. The committee, which is also mandated to identify groups that are most vulnerable to the ongoing lockdown, consists of the representatives from nationally-recognised political parties, the Nepal Army, Armed Police Force, Nepal Police, and the ward office secretary, ward chairperson and principal of a ward level school. For executing the relief plan that the Province 2 government rolled out on Monday, local councils have received funds from the provincial government. The Janakpur administration had decided to provide Rs 2.5 million for a metropolitan city, Rs 2 million for a sub-metropolitan city, Rs 1.5 million for a municipality and Rs 1 million for a rural municipality to aid vulnerable families in their areas during the lockdown.“The size of the package and the food items included will be decided by the local level committee, to be funded with the given budget,” said Shah. According to the guidelines, relief materials can be both food or cash, as decided by the local committee. In order to feed the poor and the vulnerable in the crisis period, the committee will prepare two types of packages—one for families of four and the other for families having more members.The suggested safety precautions require at least three feet of physical distance between the distributor and a recipient of relief. As per the guidelines, the relief distribution site should have soap, water and sanitiser and families should wash their hands before and after receiving the package.The Provine 2 government has announced that implementation of the drive will be strictly monitored. Provincial assembly members have been tasked with on-site monitoring of relief distribution in their constituency.“We have experienced glitches during relief distribution in the past.

The meeting has announced to provide Rs 2.5 million for metropolitan city, Rs 2 million for sub-metropolitan city, Rs 1.5 million for municipality and Rs 1 million for rural municipality to feed the poor and the vulnerable during the lockdown period. “The funds have been allocated and the required working procedures for effective distribution of the relief packages through local level governments, political party representatives, humanitarian organisations will be prepared by this evening,” Shah said. “The team will also collect data of the recipient families.” The Province 2 government said the initial relief package was only for the distribution of food items and it might come up with larger relief plans for other groups as well. “Everyone has been affected due to the ongoing crisis, but their level of struggle is varied. Poor people are scrambling for food. Even business owners are saying that their businesses have been completely halted because of the lockdown,” Shah said. “For now, we are helping those who need help the most.

People in Rautahat who recently returned from India are yet to come in contact with local units,"In the wake of the novel coronavirus outbreak that has spread across the world, thousands of Nepalis in India returned home. Every year during the harvest season, Nepalis, especially from the Tarai, move to India for work. This year, they had to cut their time short due to the outbreak which has infected over 800 people in India so far. The Nepali migrants were let inside Nepal with preliminary screening done on various border checkpoints for the virus infection. Back in Nepal, the local units are requesting Nepalis who recently returned from abroad to stay in quarantine facilities, even if the local units are scrambling to set up the facilities.Officials at local units, however, say the individuals are reluctant to stay in quarantine. Chief District Officer Basudev Ghimire said that quarantine facilities have been set up in various places including Chandranigahapur and Gaur that collectively house 69 individuals so far. But the number of people who’ve returned from India is more than that, Ghimire said. “Many people are reluctant to report to the officials,” Ghimire said. “They should be conscious of stopping the virus from spreading in the society. More importantly, they should be conscious of the health of their family members.”The number of people in Rautahat who migrate to India for work is estimated to be over 10,000. A majority of them are assumed to have returned since the pandemic but officials say they do not have the records. Neither were they properly tested to detect if they carry the virus. Some people have come into contact with the local units and are currently quarantined, the district administration has yet to identify a large swath of returnees. As a result, officials say they are worried that the returnees might have been spreading the virus among their family and society.","Published at : March 28, 2020",Rautahat,Shiva Puri
"One killed as smugglers, Nepal Army exchange fire in Parsa National Park","One man was killed when a group of wildlife smugglers exchanged gunfire with Nepal Army patrolling squad in Parsa National Park on Friday morning, according to Amir Maharjan, chief conservation officer of the park. A Nepal Army warrant officer has sustained bullet injuries in the gunfire.The incident occurred at around 9:40 in the morning some 500 metres east of Mahadev River. Maharjan said a group of around 11 smugglers had reached the Mahadev River area of the national park to hunt for wildlife. The river serves as a watering hole for the wildlife in the park, said Maharjan. Maharjan said when a patrolling team of Nepal Army from Siddhibox Battalion reached the area, smugglers opened fire on the patrolling team. The Army fired in retaliation and killed a smuggler on the spot. He has been identified as Bhim Lal Moktan, a 45-year-old from Padampokhari in Hetauda sub-metropolis. Maharjan said the smugglers might have come in search of wild animals to take advantage of the nation-wide lockdown over coronavirus concerns.The warrant officer (second class) seriously injured in the incident has been named as Min Bahadur Chantyal. He has sustained bullet injuries on his thigh. He is receiving treatment at National Medical College in Birgunj. “The bullet went through his right thigh,” said Maharjan.Maharjan said they have increased monitoring in the area after reports of wood and animal smugglers becoming active during the lockdown period surfaced.","Published at : March 27, 2020",Parsa,Shankar Acharya
"Bara is inadequately prepared to handle outbreak, health officials say","For thousands of rural population in Bara, primary health centres are their only lifeline in times of sickness. But as the country is preparing itself to prevent a major outbreak of Covid-19, which has been devastating many parts of the world, these health facilities find themselves under-equipped to care for a patient with suspected or confirmed case of the highly contagious disease.They lack the resources, both human and equipment, to treat Covid-19 patients.At this time of medical emergency, the medical workers at Ganjbawanipur Primary Health Centre in Mahagadhimai Municipality do not even have enough face masks and hand sanitisers.“We have been purchasing face masks and hand sanitisers for ourselves. The government has not sent any item that could help us deal with a possible Covid-19 outbreak,” said Nirmala Kumari Pandit, an auxiliary nurse midwife, at the centre said.The primary health centre is led by one doctor, who is assisted by a small staff of auxiliary nurse midwives and health assistants. The 12-room facility does not have enough beds in case of mass illness. The only beds available are at the birthing centre and the emergency ward, and they are not remotely enough to accommodate even a dozen patients at once. “Even if the centre had enough beds, it lacks medicines and medical equipment,” Pratima Chaudhary, another auxiliary nurse midwife, at the centre said. “Even the essential medicines are hard to come by. We have been referring most of our patients to other health facilities because we lack the means to treat them here at the centre.”Even hospitals in the district are poorly equipped. Kalaiya Hospital at the district headquarters, for instance, lacks the drugs and medical equipment to treat and contain a major outbreak of an infectious disease. Setting up a 15-bed isolation ward is the only preparation the hospital has made against Covid-19, Manoj Yadav, a hospital staff member, said. “The hospital does not have the necessary medical equipment and medicines to treat suspected Covid-19 patients.” While many health professionals in Bara are insisting that the district is underprepared in all departments to handle a major outbreak of the disease, the elected representatives are claiming that they have built fully-equipped health desks and isolation wards to deal with a possible public health emergency due to Covid-19.Bharat Bhandari, the mayor of Kolhawi Municipality, said that his office had even managed Personal Protective Equipment for health workers. Similarly, Chandan Singh, the chairman of Devtal Rural Municipality, said his office was distributing face masks and hand sanitisers to health workers.Many health facilities in Bara have in fact set up isolation wards to keep suspected Covid-19 patients, but whether these facilities are fully-equipped and their staff confident to deal with an actual emergency is a different story. The two-bed isolation ward set up by the local municipal government in Simraungadh is a case in point. “We have set up two beds to isolate patients but we don’t have beddings and bed sheets,” Manu Yadav, a local health worker, said. “We don’t even have proper beds to keep two patients, let alone personal protective equipment.”One cannot rule out the possibility of the Covid-19 spread in Bara. People are still defying the nationwide lockdown by going out and the movement of people through smaller border crossings between Nepal and India has not stopped. “We are trying to stop the movement of people on the border points, but we alone cannot do this alone. We need support from all stakeholders and the locals should also heed to the government’s request,” Digbijaya Subedi, superintendent of the Armed Police Force, said.Chief District Officer Rudra Singh Pandit also appealed to the people to comply with the lockdown orders.“Our only chance of stopping Covid-19 is taking preventive measures and staying home at this moment. The people should cooperate with the local administration and not defy the lockdown,” Pandit said.","Published at : March 27, 2020",Bara,Laxmi Sah
33 people on same flight as coronavirus-infected 19-year-old test negative,"Thirty-three people from Province 2, who were on the same flight as the second person in the country to test positive for Covid-19, have tested negative for the disease, provincial authorities said on Thursday.A total of 34 people from the province were on Qatar Airways flight QR652, which was also boarded by the infected 19-year-old woman in Doha while returning to Kathmandu from France on March 17.One individual from Siraha, who was also on the flight, however, has contracted fever. The man is receiving treatment at the Kathmandu-based Shukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. His test report hasn’t been issued yet, said police.“Thirty-three people from Province 2 returning from Qatar on the same flight as the Covid-19 patient have tested negative for the virus,” said Deputy Inspector General Pradhumna Karki from the provincial police office, Janakpur. “They are currently in self-quarantine in their own homes.” The 34 people were tracked by police after authorities intensified search for all passengers onboard QR652. After the passengers were tracked, their throat and nasal swabs were sent to the central laboratory for testing. “Everyone returning from Qatar to Province 2 is under the surveillance of health officials and security agencies,” said Bijaya Jha, senior health officer at the social development ministry of Province 2. Meanwhile, authorities are taking a host of initiatives to control the possible spread of coronavirus in the province. According to the provincial police office, 68 people have been kept in quarantine in various districts. Most of them were placed in quarantine after they returned from India and other countries in the past few weeks.However, as Nepal saw a huge influx of people from India and other countries hours before the nationwide lockdown began on Monday, authorities are facing a hard time tracking all returnees. “A majority of Nepalis working abroad, especially in India, made their way into Nepal in the last two weeks. We are working on identifying them, contacting them and keeping them under surveillance,” said Karki. In Saptari, authorities have deployed health workers to track people who returned to Nepal from foreign countries in the past 10 days.With the country confirming three Covid-19 cases—all of them “imported”—health workers in the district are keeping an eye on people who have returned from countries such as Dubai, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and India in the past 10 days.District Public Health Office chief Duniya Lal Yadav said the returnees will be kept in quarantine. He said, “The district can accommodate 215 people in 18 locations.” The health office has also urged local units to establish quarantine facilities at the earliest.According to Yadav, 36 individuals in the district have been quarantined.Quarantine facilities have also been set up in Bodebarsain Municipality, Saptakoshi Municipality, Chandanrup Municipality, and Agnisaira Krishnasavaran Rural Municipality.In Dhanusa, Nepal Army has set up a 160-bed quarantine facility at Mithila Aayurveda College, Gaguli.The Province 2 government has established a relief fund with Rs 250 million seed money to facilitate efforts to control the spread of the coronavirus. The fund will also be used to provide relief to those affected by the pandemic. According to the Minister for Internal Affairs and Law Gyanendra Kumar Yadav, provincial ministers will also contribute a month’s salary to the fund. The Cabinet meeting also decided to make provisions to allow three laboratories in Janakpur, Birgunj and Rajbiraj to test for Covid-19.  Frequently asked questions about the coronavirus outbreakUPDATED as of September 22, 2020What is Covid-19?Covid-19, short for coronavirus disease, is an illness caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, short for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Common symptoms of the disease include fever, dry cough, fatigue, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In severe cases, the infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. How contagious is Covid-19?Covid-19 can spread easily from person to person, especially in enclosed spaces. The virus can travel through the air in respiratory droplets produced when a sick person breathes, talks, coughs or sneezes. As the virus can also survive on plastic and steel surfaces for up to 72 hours and on cardboard for up to 24 hours, any contact with such surfaces can also spread the virus. Symptoms take between two to 14 days to appear, during which time the carrier is believed to be contagious.Where did the virus come from?The virus was first identified in Wuhan, China in late December. The coronavirus is a large family of viruses that is responsible for everything from the common cold to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). After an initial outbreak in Wuhan that spread across Hubei province, eventually infecting over 80,000 and killing more than 3,000, new infection rates in mainland China have dropped. However, the disease has since spread across the world at an alarming rate.   What is the current status of Covid-19?The World Health Organisation has called the ongoing outbreak a “pandemic” and urged countries across the world to take precautionary measures. Covid-19 has spread to 213 countries and territories around the world and infected more than 31,405,983 people with 967,505 deaths and 22,990,260 recoveries. In South Asia, India has reported the highest number of infections at 5,557,573 with 88,943 deaths. While Pakistan has reported 306,304 confirmed cases with 6,420 deaths. Nepal has so far reported 65,276 cases with 427 deaths.How dangerous is the disease?The mortality rate for Covid-19 is estimated to be 3.6 percent, but new studies have put the rate slightly higher at 5.7 percent. Although Covid-19 is not too dangerous to young healthy people, older individuals and those with immune-compromised systems are at greater risk of death. People with chronic medical conditions like heart disease, diabetes and lung disease, or those who’ve recently undergone serious medical procedures, are also at risk. How do I keep myself safe?The WHO advises that the most important thing you can do is wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizers with at least 60 percent alcohol content. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unclean hands. Clean and disinfect frequently used surfaces like your computers and phones. Avoid large crowds of people. Seek medical attention if symptoms persist for longer than a few days.Is it time to panic?No. The government has imposed a lockdown to limit the spread of the virus. There is no need to begin stockpiling food, cooking gas or hand sanitizers. However, it is always prudent to take sensible precautions like the ones identified above.","Published at : March 26, 2020",Janakpur/ Saptari,Ajit Tiwari						 &
Police seize a container truck carrying 52 people from Kathmandu to Birgunj on Wednesday,"The District Police Office in Parsa seized a container and arrested the driver on Wednesday for ferrying 52 passengers from Kathmandu to Birgunj. The driver was charged with hiding the passengers inside the container truck. Gautam Thapa, Deputy Superintendent of Police, said, “There were 52 people hiding inside the truck, including three children and one woman.” The container had reached Birgunj at around 1:30 am on Wednesday. “We have detained the driver, Shiva Narayan Mahato and impounded the container,” he said. According to the District Police Office, the container truck had carried goods to the Capital and returned to Birgunj carrying people. “The driver of the container will be punished according to the prevailing legal system,” said Thapa. All of the passengers of the container were Nepali nationals. On conditions of anonymity, one of the passengers said that he paid Rs 200 as transport fare to the container driver. Him, along with the rest of the passengers, are currently kept at a quarantine facility at Ayurved Hospital in Birgunj, said Gautam. The Ayurved Hospital has set up a 50-bed quarantine facility with a medical team of security personnel from Nepal Army and Nepal Police. According to Lalit Basnet, assistant chief district officer, the medical team is conducting general medical tests of the 52 passengers. “If there are no suspicious cases, we will hand them over to their families. For now, we are awaiting their health reports,” said Basnet. The government has prohibited all public movement Tuesday onwards, except to seek medical attention or purchase essential goods. A meeting of the high-level committee for the prevention and control of Covid-19, led by Deputy Prime Minister Ishwar Pokhrel, took the decision on Monday evening, hours after a second coronavirus case was confirmed in the country. The government has also decided to book anyone defying the government order under the Infectious Disease Control Act. According to the Act, violators are liable for a jail term of a month or a Rs100 fine, or both. As per the Nepal Gazette, published on October 14 last year, the government enlisted 19 services as “essential”. These essential services include telephone; transportation; civil aviation; airport; mint or governmental press; defence affairs relating to arms, ammunition or production of any military goods; communication; internal security; drinking water; residence of tourists; petroleum products; health; medicines; bank; insurance; and electricity.","Published at : March 25, 2020",Parsa,Shankar Acharya
Birgunj juvenile reform home turn away parents who had come to take their children home amid Covid-19 scare,"A group of parents who had reached the juvenile reform home in Birgunj on Tuesday to take their children home amid Covid-19 lockdown were turned away.They had reached the facility after four teenage boys were handed over to their parents on Monday.Tika Krishna Kaphle, chief of the juvenile home, said the four boys were released at the instruction of the concerned courts. “We have handed them to their parents on condition of making them available if needed in the future,” Kaphle said.   He added that the juvenile home will not be releasing any of the juvenile inmates during the lockdown period. Meanwhile, the Birgunj Prison is preparing to release some of the inmates to minimise the risk of coronavirus spread inside the prison facility. Those who are set to be released are elderly inmates with sentences lower than two years. Prison officer Shrawan Kumar Pokharel said the Department of Prison Management had decided to release inmates who are above 65 years of age. “We have sent a list of 49 names of elderly inmates to the department,” said Pokharel. The department has also asked the details of inmates serving jail terms for one year or less. “There are more than two dozen such inmates in Birgunj Prison. I have started to collect applications from those inmates from Tuesday,” said Pokharel. The Covid-19 release programme for prisoners, however, will not apply to repeat convicts.  According to the prison administration, the inmates will be released only after the lockdown has been lifted. “We are not going to leave the inmates stranded on their way to their homes,” said Pokharel. Currently, there are 1,300 inmates, males and females, in Birgunj prison which is twice the capacity of the prison. To stem the possible spread of coronavirus, the prison administration has compulsorily enforced the rules of facemasks and sanitisers for visitors as well as limited the visiting hours. “We are only allowing one visitor per inmate these days. The visitors are not allowed to bring food to the inmates,” said Pokharel. According to data on the prison published a year ago, there are more than 80 inmates suffering from high blood pressure and 32 from diabetes in the prison. There are also a few asthma and HIV/AIDS patients. “This is why the prison is at high risk of coronavirus. We are also on high alert as many Indian nationals also arrive in the prison to meet inmates on a daily basis,” said Pokharel.","Published at : March 25, 2020",Parsa,Shankar Acharya
Security measures stepped up in Province 2 following the death of a man in Bihar due to Covid-19,"Province 2 authorities have increased vigilance along the Nepal-India border after a person died of Covid-19 in the neighbouring Indian state of Bihar on Sunday. Local authorities have urged security personnel deployed at various border points in all eight districts of the province to remain alert. The authorities have also started screening individuals returning from India for symptoms akin to Covid-19.With the ‘Janata curfew’ (people’s curfew) in effect in India on Sunday for 14 hours, the province saw a relatively low movement of people in the border area. Nonetheless, there was a heavy presence of security personnel at various border crossings, including Jatahi of Dhanusa district and Matihani of Mahottari district.The Birgunj-Raxaul border point, one of the major points linking Nepal and India, also saw a fewer number of people crossing the border.Border authorities on either side have banned pedestrians and vehicles, including two-wheelers and e-rickshaws, from crossing the border. DSP Amar Khatri of the Armed Police Force, deployed at the Birgunj customs, informed that six Indian nationals were denied entry after they showed symptoms similar to that of Covid-19.Dr Niraj Singh of the Birgunj-based Narayani Hospital pointed out that the administration should prioritise the strict enforcement of 14-day quarantine of Nepalis who are entering the country from India through various border points. “The authorities must urge all citizens, including people from the other side, to observe self-quarantine,” said Singh, adding that they should be treated at the isolation ward of a hospital only after showing symptoms of Covid-19.Likewise, the flow of people from either side of the border at Bairganiya in Rautahat district was also low. Health officials at the help desk, who until Saturday were overwhelmed by people returning from India, were seen relaxed as both nations have stopped the movement of people through the border point.“The Bairganiya border point has never been this empty, not even during strikes called by political parties,” said Lakhan Sah, who runs a paan shop nearby. “People have been aware of the spread of coronavirus, but there is a sense of fear in the past few days.”In view of the Covid-19 outbreak in India, the Saptari administration has also banned the entry of people from India in seven out of its eight border points. Only Kunauli bazaar border crossing is open for people to enter Nepal.

Birgunj-based businessman reported to have contracted Covid-19 tests negative for the virus,"A Birgunj resident, who was earlier reported to have tested positive for Covid-19, has tested negative for the coronavirus that causes the disease.The 52-year-old businessman from Birgunj was admitted to Patna Medical College and Hospital on suspicion of contracting the disease.A section of the media earlier on Sunday had reported that he had tested positive for Covid-19.Patna Medical College and Hospital had sent his oropharyngeal swab to Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences on March 20 (Friday).“The hospital had initially told the family that he was tested positive for the virus in the first test,” the businessman’s nephew who is with him in Patna told the Post over the phone. “However, the lab report on Sunday showed he had tested negative for the virus.”The lab report specifically mentions “negative” for 2019-nCoV, yet another term for Covid-19 caused by a new strain of the coronavirus which now has been dubbed SARS-CoV-2.Media reports earlier in the day suggesting that the man had tested positive for the virus had prompted widespread concerns. So far Nepal has reported only one Covid-19 case, and that too has been recovered.To control the spread of the virus, the Nepal government in recent days has taken a slew of measures, including suspending all flights to the country, all long-haul transport and all non-essential services.On Sunday evening, the Cabinet decided to close down borders with India and China for a week effective from 10am Monday.The decision follows New Delhi’s decision to suspend all passenger trains, bus services, metro and inter-state bus services until March 31, putting all 75 districts where coronavirus cases have been reported under lockdown.Amid a growing number of Covid-19 cases in India, concerns were rising in Nepal over the possible entry of the virus via open border points.

Province 2 tightens border with India as Covid-19 precautions,"As cases of coronavirus infections are rising steadily in neighbouring India, Nepal’s Province 2 has imposed a ‘near-total lockdown’ at its border points following a meeting on Saturday with the Indian security force. All eight districts of the province share borders with India—where the Covid-19 pandemic has infected over 280 people and killed four so far, and where a significant number of the districts’ population work. It is estimated that, on average, about 2,000 people travel across the border points every day.“We have restricted movement across the border and have increased the number of security personnel at border points,” DIG Raju Aryal of Province 2 APF told the Post. According to Aryal, the lockdown came into effect since Saturday afternoon, while help desks and checkpoints have been set up in 75 spots across the border areas.Meanwhile, only two borders—Raxaul and Jatahi—are open for transporting goods across the two countries, according to Koshhari Niraula, CDO of Dhanusha district. Niraula said authorities have started the process of converting Mujelia-based Manipal Hospital into a quarantine facility for contingent cases.So far, the border security hasn’t detected any infected persons or suspects, according to DIG Pradhyumna Karki of Nepal Police. “We have set up joint help desks across the border and are working in coordination with Indian security,” Karki said. “In case we detect any infections, we will immediately rush the suspects to hospitals and keep them in isolation.”As of Saturday, the novel coronavirus disease, which was first identified in the Chinese city of Wuhan in January, has reached 185 countries and territories. The scourge has claimed the lives of over 11,000 globally and infected over 270,000. In Nepal, there has been only one case so far, and the patient has recovered after treatment.

Dialysis services in a government hospital halt due to chemical shortage,"Aisa Khatun, a resident of Bahudarmai Municipality in Parsa, needs to undergo dialysis twice a week. On Thursday morning, Khatun was scheduled for dialysis at Narayani Hospital, a government hospital in Birgunj, but her session was cancelled due to a lack of chemicals used in dialysis.“The hospital issued a notice which stated that it would stop providing dialysis services from Wednesday due to a lack of chemicals. The hospital did not inform us about the closure of the services beforehand,” said Khatun. “My health condition will deteriorate if I do not get dialysis on time. I am very worried now.”Seeta Kumari, 51, of Malhani in Mahagadhimai Municipality was also at Narayani Hospital to get dialysis on Thursday. But due to the closure of dialysis services at the hospital, she had to go to the National Medical College, a private hospital in Birgunj, to seek treatment.“We had to pay Rs 7,000 for a dialysis session at the private hospital,” said Kumari’s son, Bir Kumar.Narayani Hospital in Birgunj provided free dialysis services to 18 to 20 kidney patients on a daily basis. Dr Madan Kumar Upadhayay, medical superintendent at the hospital, said the services have been closed due to a lack of chemicals used in dialysis.“We have been looking for the chemical for the past one month,” said Upadhyay. “We had to stop the services since our stock ran out.”Upadhyay also said that the hospital has deployed an employee to procure the chemical. “We are making efforts to resume dialysis services soon,” he said. In the current fiscal year, Premier Suppliers had been awarded the contract to supply chemicals for dialysis to the hospital. Harendra Yadav, chief at the hospital’s pharmacy, said the supplier company has already provided money to the chemical company, but the hospital is yet to receive the consignment.“If we procure the chemical soon, we will be able to resume the services by Friday,” Yadav said.However, patients and their relatives blamed the shortage on the hospital’s negligence. “Other hospitals in the district are running dialysis services without a glitch. There’s a shortage in Narayani Hospital only,” said Khatun. Meanwhile, the CT scan machine of the hospital has also not been working for the last 10 months. The Department of Health had provided the machine to the hospital two and a half years ago.","Published at : March 21, 2020",Birgunj,Bhusan Yadav
"Health workers, security personnel in Province 2 are screening people for coronavirus without protective gear","Ministers and provincial assembly members of Province 2 have called for adopting preventive measures to check the spread of Covid-19. Saroj Yadav, speaker for the provincial assembly, asked the government to start preparations to control the spread.The ministers and provincial assembly members may have started to attend meetings wearing face masks, but similar precautionary measures have not been implemented at health desks established along Nepal-India borders of Province 2. Two health workers have been deployed at the Malangawa border point in Sarlahi with a thermometer to screen the incoming traffic. Malangawa Municipality had established the health desk on March 5. When the Post reached the border point on Wednesday, the health workers were going about their duty without face masks. Kusheshowr Sah, one of the health assistants at the health desk, said the municipality’s health section only provided them with a thermometer for screening people. “We have been deployed at the health desk from 9am to 5pm but we haven’t been given face masks and other essential medical equipment to screen people,” he said. “I purchased a face mask from the bazaar but it didn’t help.” Masks, gloves, apron, and protective glasses are essential materials to screen people for Covid-19, say health officials.A week ago, the Health Office in Parsa had notified and requested the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division in Kathmandu to provide masks, test kits, sanitiser spray machines, laser thermometer, poster pamphlets and gowns for health workers and security personnel. Kameshwor Chaurasiya, chief of the health office, said health workers and security personnel at the border points are on the frontline and need protective gear for their own safety and that of those who come in contact with them. “We have sent the letter to the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division demanding the safety materials,” said Chaurasiya. “But the equipment and gear are yet to arrive.”Meanwhile, the health workers deployed at the health desk in Birgunj-Raxaul border point said they are having a hard time screening passengers because of the overwhelming number. “If we start to screen all passengers at the border point, there will be a traffic jam. It’s impossible to screen everybody,” said Jahir Alam, a health assistant. Arun Mahato, chief at the Health Division of Birgunj Metropolis, advised the locals against going to Raxaul bazaar except for important works. “We plan to add more health workers at the health desk and step up the screening process,” said Mahato.In Rautahat, most of the health workers are not willing to work at the health desk on the border. Gaur Municipality has established a health desk at the customs point in Gaur. Two health workers Kumari Pabe, a senior auxiliary nurse midwife, and Nisha Jaiswal, an auxiliary health worker, have been deployed there. “It’s just the two of us here at the health desk. We are working an eight-hour shift,” Pabe said. “The municipality has directed health workers to work at the health desk until the border closes but no one is willing to work here.” In Siraha, the local administration has established health desks with thermal scanners and medical teams at Madar, Thadi and Bariyarpatti border points. Gopal Kumar Adhikari, chief district officer, said the local administration has kept health workers and security personnel on high alert. “We are also going to establish an isolation ward in the hospital soon,” said Adhikari.

Illegal sale and production of illicit liquor spell trouble for Dhanusha,"The District Police Office in Dhanusha has confiscated and destroyed a large quantity of illicit liquor and the ingredients used in making such liquor from 38 illegal breweries in the last two days.Deputy Superintendent of Police Rameshowr Karki said they launched the drive to stop the production and sale of home-brewed alcohol following alcohol poisoning-related deaths in Ramdaiya in Dhanusha recently. Nine people had died after drinking home-brewed liquor during the Holi festival on Wednesday. Six others were taken severely ill.Ashok Jha, inspector of District Police Office in Dhanusha, said the sick people were receiving treatment at Janaki Medical College and Janakpur Provincial Hospital.Police are yet to reveal the nature of the alcohol consumed by the victims, but locals say that they had drunk liquor containing toxic components. Health experts warn that the consumption of such alcoholic products even in small doses could be lethal.“We seized the raw materials and equipment used to prepare illicit liquors,” said Karki. Police have also arrested seven individuals involved in the production, supply and sale of home-brewed alcohol in Dhanusha. “The seized alcohol was brewed in Bhangaha. It was brought to Ramdaiya and supplied to various local eateries,” said Karki. This is not the first incident of hooch-related deaths in Dhanusha district. Nineteen people had died of alcohol poisoning in 1992, six in 2006 and seven in 2018.The District Police Office claim that they have been launching crackdowns on the production and sale of illicit liquor. However, the lawmakers of Province 2 during Monday’s assembly meeting blamed the police for allowing the illegal production and sale of liquor. Shivachandra Chaudhary, a provincial assembly member of Nepali Congress, blamed the police for protecting illegal brewers. “The production, sale and consumption of toxic liquor are rife in Dhanusha, as police are doing nothing to shut down these illegal businesses,” he said.Upendra Mahato, a provincial assembly member of Rastriya Janata Party, said the police chief of Dhanusha should take responsibility for the deaths of those nine people killed by illegal alcohol. Province 2 assembly members also demanded strong action against the persons responsible for the supply and sale of toxic alcohol. They also pressurised the provincial government to take measures to curb illegal production and distribution of alcohol in the region.Responding to assembly members demand, Gyanendra Yadav, minister of internal affairs and law, claimed that all illegal liquor shops and breweries in the province would be shut down within three days. “The ministry is taking the strong measures to stop illegal production and distribution of alcohol,” said Yadav. The ministry has directed all police offices in the province to immediately shut down illegal breweries and shops that sell home-brewed liquor. “We will take action against the respective police unit chief if he/she fails to comply with the orders,” said Yadav.","Published at : March 17, 2020",Dhanusha,Santosh Singh
Traffic policemen face difficulties in monitoring e-rickshaws in Birgunj city,"Traffic personnel in Birgunj are having a hard time monitoring the city’s e-rickshaws, most of which have been operating without registration. According to the District Traffic Police Office in Parsa, there are around 2,000 e-rickshaws in Birgunj, and only around 350 of them are registered with the office. Kamalraj Pandit, inspector at the District Traffic Police Office, said there has been a heavy proliferation of unregistered e-rickshaws in Birgunj in the recent years.  In the past, the Transport Management Office in Narayani used to register e-rickshaws. This responsibility was transferred to local governments with the implementation of federalism, and ever since, the number of e-rickshaws have increased in Birgunj. However, the majority of the e-rickshaws operating in the city are not registered with the city office. “Most of the drivers are found driving e-rickshaws without registration papers or licences. The city office is not monitoring the operation of e-rickshaws in the city,” said Pandit.Many e-rickshaws in Birgunj are also found carrying passengers beyond their capacity and causing traffic congestion, particularly at Ghantaghar-Makalu Hotel Chowk, according to the traffic police. “Most e-rickshaw drivers lack awareness about traffic rules and regulations,” said Pandit.Amjad Ansari, an e-rickshaw driver, blamed the city office for not issuing registration documents to e-rickshaw drivers.“The city office rarely issues registration document on time,” he said. As for the traffic congestion caused by e-rickshaws, Ansari said the city office should build parking lots.Birgunj Metropolitan City had recently called a meeting to solve the problem of traffic congestion. Arbinda Lal Karna, the information officer at the city office, said the meeting, which was attended by the officials at the District Administration Office, District Police Office and elected representatives, decided to manage the city’s traffic flow by building parking spaces for vehicles and registering all e-rickshaws operating in the city. “We are going to allocate parking space for vehicles and also start the registration process of e-rickshaws,” said Karna.","Published at : March 11, 2020",Parsa,Shankar Acharya
Stone extraction rampant in Chure’s rivers and streams,"Despite the government’s ban, illegal extraction of riverbed materials from the Chure range is still rampant in Siraha district.The Chure area, which covers around 13 percent of the country’s total area, is prone to natural hazards such as floods, landslides and erosion because of excessive extraction of riverbed materials. However, people are still haphazardly extracting aggregates from the rivers in Balan, Jhirhari, Gagan and Khatti, among other parts, of the Chure region. The excavated materials are being exported by contractors of construction companies, say locals.“Stone smugglers are working in collusion with the forest employees,” said Pardip Mahato, a local.The government has set up subdivision forest offices in Lahan, Dhangadhi, Siraha, Mirchaiya, Jamdaha and Bandipur to protect the forest areas, keep a check on illegal extraction of riverbed materials and to curb smuggling activities. However, the forest offices do not conduct regular patrolling. “We have informed the forest officials about the illegal extraction time and again. But the forest office has not paid any attention to our complaints,” said Mahato. The government had declared the Chure area as an Environment Conservation Area on June 16, 2014. “The smugglers are still using tractors to extract stones from prohibited zones,” said Mahato. “The forest officials, meanwhile, are being mute spectators.”Meanwhile, forest officials blame the local units of encouraging construction companies and smugglers to continue with the illegal extraction. “The local units have signed contracts regarding the use of stones, pebbles and sand from rivers and streams. And by taking advantage of such contracts, the contractors haphazardly excavate riverbed materials. We are unable to inspect the area due to limited human resources,” said Subhash Chandra Das, division forest officer. According to Forest Act (1993) and Forest Regulation (1955), the forest office can charge a person Rs 1.5 for smuggling one cubic metre of stone, and fine a vehicle up to Rs 10,000 (as bail) for carrying stones. “One tractor can carry 100 cubic metres of stones. Even if we fine them, the amount is negligible. It amounts to only Rs 150 for smuggling 100 cubic metres of stones, whereas the smugglers sell the materials for Rs 3,200,” Das said. “That is also why the smugglers feel emboldened to continue with the illegal activity.”According to Das, the Forest Act and Forest Regulation should be amended to update the legal system and increase the fines. “The local authorities should restrict tractors that were distributed in agriculture grant from carrying riverbed materials and forest products,” said Das.","Published at : March 11, 2020",Siraha,Bharat Jarghamagar
Chief accused of journalist Birendra Sah’s murder arrested,"Police on Sunday arrested Narendra Faujdar (Kundan), 50, who was accused of killing journalist Birendra Sah.Sah, a print and broadcast journalist, was killed in October 2007, allegedly by Ram Ekwal Sahani and Faujdar, who was then associated with the Nepal Communist Party (Maoist). At the time of the killing, they had already struck the 12-point peace deal with an alliance of seven political parties following a decade-long insurgency.SP Krishna Pangeni of Bara Police said they arrested Faujdar from his private residence in Gadhal, Baragadhi Rural Municipality, by tracking the GPS of his phone.“Faujdar, with the help of local politicians, was in hiding. We were successful in nabbing him at the fourth attempt,” Pangeni said.Faujdar will be present at the district court on Monday to deliver his court statement. He is one of the five convicts in the case.Journalist Sah was abducted while he was at work in Pipara Bazaar of Bara on October 4, 2007. He was then taken to a nearby jungle and was tortured before being shot dead. Sah’s body was discovered in Tangiyabasti 35 days later.A police investigation has found that Faujdar was also engaged in drug smuggling and lootings in the past.","Published at : March 8, 2020",Bara,Laxmi Sah
Fire lines formed to protect community forest in Rautahat,"Hatemalo Community Forest Users Group in Chandrapur, Saptari, has taken initiatives to form a fire line to prevent wildfires from breaking out in the forest.According to locals, the community forest has sal saplings planted in 3.5 hectares of forestland in Chandrapur Municipality, and the fire line was formed to protect the sal saplings.Every year during the dry season, wildfires destroy hundreds of sal trees in the forest. Janga Bahadur Ghalan, vice chairman of the forest users group, said the forest authorities are collaborating with people’s representatives to preserve forest resources. “This year, we are going to form seven fire lines in the forest area to prevent wildfires from spreading,” said Ghalan. The forest has deployed 12 employees to form fire lines.The wildfire season in Nepal begins in between November and December and continues until the onset of monsoon. Binod Singh, the division forest officer of Rautahat, said wildfires are common during the dry season from mid-February to mid-June in Tarai. “Wildfires destroy vegetations and affect wildlife during the dry season. This is why we have brought the concept of scientific forest management,” said Singh, adding that all concerned stakeholders should work together to preserve the forest. Sundar Prasad Sharma, under-secretary at the Department of Forest and Soil Conservation, said that the country since 2005 has been losing some 200,000 hectares of forest area annually. According to Sharma, the forest fires in 2009 were the deadliest; forty-nine people, including 13 Nepal Army personnel, died while controlling forest fires in Ramechhap district.In 2016, Nepal lost nearly 1.3million hectares of forest land to forest blaze that also killed 15 people, according to Sharma’s data. A study of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) showed that 90 percent of forest fires are man-made. “Most forest fires are caused due to sheer human negligence. Discarding cigarette butts without properly stubbing them is the main reason for forest fires,” Singh said. “Locals should be aware of the negative impact of forest fires. They contribute significantly to air pollution by generating haze and smog and have effects on environmental health.”In 2010, the government introduced the Forest Fire Management Strategy for curbing forest fires. But officials and locals still lack the capacity and tools to contain such fires. The National Disaster Risk Reduction Strategic Action Plan 2018-2030 also talks in detail about controlling and preventing forest fires, but it remains far from implementation.","Published at : March 8, 2020",Rautahat,Shiva Puri
Musahar children are enrolled in schools but only a few go to classes,"School enrolment drive and mid-day meal programme have failed to produce desired results in Rautahat’s Chandrapur Municipality. Many children, mostly from the Musahar community in Chandrapur, continue to remain out of school, according to officials. Read: A Musahar settlement in Rautahat lacks land to build toiletsThere are 100 children of schoolgoing age at a Musahar settlement in Chetnagar village. Only a few of them go to school, even though they were admitted in Pancha Basic School during the enrolment drive for the current academic season. “Less than 10 percent of Musahar children come to school. I visit the Musahar settlement almost every day and request the parents to send their children to school, but they never listen,” said Gagan Dev Yadav, the school headmaster.Read: Musahar girl champions the cause of ending child marriage in communityBhagawat Chaudhary, one of the teachers at the school, said a few Musahar children come to school and that too irregularly.“They are usually present on Fridays, and that is because the school serves eggs as mid-day meal,” Chaudhary said. “The mid-day meal programme has failed to attract children, particularly from the impoverished communities like Musahar.”Dev Prasad Timilsina, an MP elected from Rautahat, said when he visited the Musahar settlement on a school day a few days earlier, he saw many children playing on the streets.“When I advised the parents of these children to send their kids to school, they offered me a vague assurance,” Timilsina said. Bhutani Devi Musahar has five children aged between 5 and 14. All five of them were enrolled in school, but they rarely attend their classes.“We have to work as daily wage workers to manage food. How can we educate our children?” said Bhutani. “We cannot afford stationeries and school supplies to send our children to school.”In Padahariya village of Chandrapur, 12 Musahar children were admitted at local Janapriya Basic School in the current academic year. But only two to three students are regulars in their classes. “I frequently visit the Musahar settlement and request them to send their children to school. The children come to school for a few days. And then they stop,” said Birendra Prasad, the school headmaster.Anup Majhi, a leader of the Musahar community, said that poverty was the main hurdle for the Musahar people to send their children for education. According to him, only 635 of 3,800 Musahar children in Rautahat go to school.Dipendra Mandal, chief of the education unit at the municipal office, said they were working on a policy to ensure that all children are included in the school system.“We plan to address the problem starting from the upcoming academic session,” he said.","Published at : March 5, 2020",Rautahat,Shiva Puri
"Provincial assembly to decide name, capital of Province 2 through voting on March 13","As political parties failed to reach a consensus, the provincial assembly has decided to conduct voting to name Province 2 and designate its capital on March 13.The longstanding issue is going to be decided through voting, as a constitutional committee headed by Speaker Saroj Yadav was unsuccessful in naming the province unanimously due to the differences among the major political parties. “The provincial assembly meeting that will decide the name and capital of the province through voting is scheduled for March 13. The voting has been scheduled as per the spirit of the constitution,” said Ranjit Yadav, acting secretary at the provincial assembly secretariat.The ruling parties—Samajbadi Party Nepal (SPN) and Rastriya Janata Party-Nepal (RJP-N)—registered a proposal at the provincial assembly demanding to name the province as Madhes and Dhanusha as its capital. Nepal Communist Party and Nepali Congress proposed to name the province Janaki and Mithila-Bhojpura respectively.As Nepal Communist Party and Nepali Congress lack numerical strength in the assembly, their proposals are unlikely to get approval. “The name of the province is unlikely to get decided, as political parties are divided on the issue. However, all major political parties agree to make Janakpur the capital,” said Prameshwor Sah, the whip of RJP-NAs per the constitutional provision, the provincial assembly has the authority to name the province and designate its capital by a two-third majority. The ruling Madhes-based parties do not have the required numerical strength to decide on the issue. The SPN and RJP-N have 30 and 25 members respectively in the 107-member provincial assembly while the NCP and the NC have 32 and 19 seats respectively.Provinces 3, 4, 6 and 7 have been named Bagmati, Gandaki, Karnali, and Sudurpaschim respectively.

Elephantiasis still a major health challenge in Bara district,"The control of Lymphatic Filariasis, commonly known as elephantiasis, has been a major health challenge in Bara district. The authorities concerned have been struggling to control the disease for the past six years, but a large number of people are still found suffering from it.According to Shankar Prasad Gupta, district coordinator of the division responsible for controlling the spread of the disease, there are at present more than 1,200 elephantiasis patients in the district.“The drug administration and awareness programmes launched to control the disease have not been effective. The negligence of the health workers and a lack of public health awareness are the main reasons behind the failure of the drive,” said Gupta. According to him, health workers are not working diligently to administer the drugs and to launch awareness campaigns to control the disease in the district’s rural areas.The government on February 8 had launched a mass drug administration programme in Bara. This is the third time the government ran the programme in the district in the past six years. “Cases of elephantiasis are still alarmingly high in the district. We plan to continue the programme until the number of patients is reduced below 20,” said Gupta.Elephantiasis is caused by small, threadlike parasitic worms spread by Culex female mosquitoes. These worms prosper in the human lymphatic system and cause the swelling of arms, legs, head, genitals or breasts.The government has been launching mass drug administration programmes in the affected districts to reduce the number of elephantiasis patients. According to the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division under the Ministry of Health and Population, the ministry is launching a campaign to administer Diethy-lcarbamasine and Albe-ndazole tablets to counter the disease. A health study conducted in 2003 shows that around 13 percent of the total population in 61 districts are affected by the disease.According to the World Health Organisation, an area is said to free from elephantiasis when the number of infected reaches below one percent. The organisation says that elephantiasis has affected 40 million people in 83 countries. “As per the standards set by the WHO, Bara district has so far been unsuccessful in controlling the disease. That’s why we decided to launch the drug administration programme in the district again,” said Bijaya Kumar Jha, a senior public health administrator at the Provincial Health Directorate.According to Jha, people are reluctant to take the drug fearing further health complications. “Everybody should take the drug to eliminate the risk of contracting elephantiasis. However, it’s hard to convince people about the advantages of taking the drug,” said Jha. However, the drug should not be administered to patients of chronic diseases such as cancer, high blood pressure; ailments related to heart, lungs and liver; postpartum mothers of less than a week and children below the age of five and those suffering from severe malnutrition.","Published at : March 3, 2020",Bara,Laxmi Sah
Birgunj locals attempt to save bats,"Locals of Jagarnathpur, Birgunj, are attempting to save around 500 bats that live near the Gandak canal by prohibiting their killing.Locals, who say the bats are the pride of the community, used to kill the animal for meat as it was believed that it would cure diseases such as asthma. But following a decline in their numbers, they have stopped doing so.“I have seen these bats for as long as I can remember, and so did my grandfather,” said Hari Narayan Patel, a 45-year-old local. “Bats have been the identity of the village. Many people in the district know Jagarnathpur as the village of bats,” he said.Patel added that the bats in his village are significantly larger than those found elsewhere and don’t cause harm to their crops. But lately, their number has declined to around 500 in a decade.“While there are beliefs that bat meat cures diseases such as asthma, we have imposed a prohibition in their killing,” said Birendra Sah, 39.","Published at : March 3, 2020",Parsa,Shankar Acharya
Final exams are just a month away but a Siraha school has yet to teach three subjects,"The annual examinations of the current academic year are just a month away, but a community school in Siraha has yet to start teaching a subject, while it only recently commenced teaching two other subjects.“The final examination is coming near. But the teachers have not even started teaching Moral Science. The classes for Occupation and Health started recently, but we don’t know anything about these subjects. How can we pass the exam?” said Shrawan Kumar Ram, a seventh-grader at Pidarboni Aadharbhut Bidhyalaya, a basic-level school in Lahan Municipality-11. The school administration admitted its delay in teaching the subjects to its students.“We could not teach a few subjects from grades six to eight due to a lack of teachers. The school has only four teachers for all students of grades one to eight,” said Bilat Chaudhary, the school headmaster. According to him, the then district education office in 2012 allowed the school to run classes till grade eight but did not appoint teachers.In the absence of teachers, the four current teachers who were hired to teach the primary level (grades one to five) have been teaching classes up to the eight standards.“I have repeatedly urged the authorities concerned to hire additional teachers but to no avail,” said Bilat.The students are worried about the upcoming exams, as they have not been taught three subjects.“We are not sure if we will pass the annual examination or not. Especially the students of grade eight will be hit hardest as they have to sit for the board examinations—Basic Level Examination—conducted by the local government,” said Puja Kumari Chaudhari, an eighth-grader.The final examination in all community schools in the district has been scheduled from March 29.The teachers in Pidarboni Aadharbhut Bidhyalaya argue that quality education cannot be imparted until the authorities allocate more teachers to the school. “We are primary level teachers but we have to teach students of grades six, seven and eight as well,” said one of the four teachers at the school. The school management claimed that the municipality has paid no heed to the school’s issues.“The authorities are ruining the future of our students—85 percent of whom come from the Dalit community,” said Surya Narayan Ram, a member of the school management committee.Like Pidarboni Aadharbhut Bidhyalaya, there are altogether 59 community schools in Lahan Municipality. Most of the schools lack the required subject teachers. Khemananda Bhusal, chief executive officer of the municipality, admitted that the community schools in the municipality suffer from a staff shortage. “In the lack of subject teachers, the community schools have failed to provide quality education. We are preparing to assign more teachers to these schools from the new academic session,” said Bhusal.The new academic session in the hills and Tarai districts begins from mid-April each year.","Published at : March 1, 2020",Siraha,Bharat Jargha Magar
Flood fear looms over villages close to vulnerable embankments in Rautahat,"As many as 24 people died and around 4,000 houses were destroyed in floods and landslides in several settlements of Rautahat district in July last year. The rain-swollen Lalbakaiya and Bagmati rivers had breached their levees at 13 places and inundated more than two-thirds of the district.In the wake of the disaster, the federal and provincial ministers and high-level officials had pledged to repair the embankments, but that pledge has not yet been fulfilled.“The upcoming rainy season is going to be hard on riverside settlements. It will certainly bring destruction if the damaged embankments are not repaired,” said Chief District Officer Basudev Ghimire.According to Ghimire, the Lalbakaiya embankment had suffered nine breaches while the Bagmati embankment was damaged at four places.The northern region of the district was heavily flooded as a result. Around 30,000 people, particularly from Ishnath, Gaur, Durgabhagawati and Rajdevi areas, were directly affected, while properties worth more than Rs 150 million were either damaged or destroyed. Monsoon enters Nepal in early June, which means the authorities have only four months left to repair the damaged levees. People living close to the Lalbakaiya and Bagmati rivers doubt that the embankments will be fixed in time. “Nobody is bothered about building or repairing the embankments. They should have started the works in the winter season,” said Grisha Sandan Singh, a local of Banjaraha. Raj Kumar Shreebastav, the chief of Bagmati and Lalbakaiya River Control Office in Parwanipur, said the office will soon start the repair works. “The higher authority has not yet released the funds required to repair the embankments. We, however, aim to complete the repair work by mid-May. All the damaged embankments will be repaired before the monsoon,” he said.The office has requested the Department of Water Induced Disaster Management for Rs 230 million to repair the damaged embankments. Last year, the office had placed gabion walls and sandbags to control the river floodings, but to no avail. The embankments along the flood-prone Bagmati and Lalbakaiya rivers were constructed around 20 years ago with the support of the Indian government. The embankments are often breached during the monsoon season.In 2017, the rivers had breached their embankments at 31 places.","Published at : February 28, 2020",Rautahat,Shiva Puri

Traffic congestion in Rajbiraj affects locals,"Traffic congestion at Neta Chowk—the main road that links Rajbiraj to the East-West Highway—in Rajbiraj Municipality has affected the daily lives of locals.Since the town area does not have a bus park, public vehicles stay put on the road to pick up passengers, causing a long traffic snarl, said Lalan Kumar Jha, a local. “The traffic jam in this area poses problems for not only vehicles but pedestrians too,” said Jha. The problem has been further exacerbated by the ongoing construction of roadside drainage in the southern part of Neta Chowk along the Postal Highway. “Construction materials are piled up on the road, worsening the traffic congestion,” said Jha.Uttam Karki, a police inspector at the District Traffic Office in Rajbiraj, said the situation has worsened since passenger vehicles started using Neta Chowk as their pick-up and drop-off points. “In the past few days, traffic jams have become chronic in this area,” said Karki, adding that he has deployed traffic personnel to manage the traffic flow. According to the data provided by the District Traffic Office, at least 300 vehicles pass through Neta Chowk every day from 8 am to 6 pm. Nanda Kumar Mandal, one of the policemen deployed in the road, said the congestion has increased the risk of accidents. “We are trying to manage the traffic, but it’s difficult. Everyone should understand the situation and follow traffic rules to minimise the risk of road accidents,” said Mandal. Krishna Prasai, superintendent of police in Rajbiraj, said his department is looking for ways to solve the problem. Since traffic congestion is a perennial problem faced by the locals, they demand the municipality to construct a proper parking area for public vehicles. “A bus park is under construction near Rajdevi Temple in Rajbiraj Municipality Ward No. 2,” said Shambhu Prasad Yadav, mayor of Rajbiraj Municipality. “We hope the construction of the new bus park will be completed soon and will put an end to the traffic problem.”","Published at : February 27, 2020",Rajbiraj,Abdhesh Kumar Jha
"At one of country’s oldest campuses, no running water, no toilets and few classes","At the Thakur Ram Multiple Campus in Birgunj, the toilets don’t have running water and the hostel rooms leak. The buildings are in a terrible condition, overgrown with moss and covered in grime. For the past two weeks, lecturers have been on strike, demanding contracts and fair payment. And last week, the students also went on strike, demanding a ‘favourable environment’ for their studies.For a campus with a long and storied history of education, these are trying times. Thakur Ram Campus was established in 1952, nearly nine years before Tribhuvan University, the country’s oldest varsity. The campus was first affiliated with Patna University in India, but later moved to Tribhuvan University after it was established. For many decades, the campus was the sole option for students from Saptari to Chitwan seeking higher education. Thousands of students have passed through its halls, going on to become politicians, intellectuals and business persons. Former prime minister Madhav Kumar Nepal, the first commissioner of the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority Surya Prasad Upadhyay, the chief minister of Province 2 Lalbabu Raut have either studied or taught at the campus. The buildings are in a terrible condition, overgrown with moss and covered in grime.  Shankar Acharya/TKPWhen Tribhuvan University was established, Nepal didn’t have enough lecturers, but Thakur Ram Campus welcomed lecturers from across the border and as a result, the campus’ academics was among the best in the country, according to Baikuntha Srivastava, former chair of the campus chapter of the Free Student Union.But ever since the 2000s, the campus has been struggling to maintain its celebrated past. A lack of financial resources has meant that Thakur Ram is now a shell of itself, plagued with infrastructure, logistical and political issues.Though the campus occupies 14 bighas (94,800 sq m) of land, it is currently operating out of two dilapidated buildings suffering from a host of problems.“The condition is dire,” said Pramod Das, a second-year M.Ed. student who lives on campus. “The entire building, including all of the roofs, leaks when it rains and the toilets are virtually unusable.”Pramod Kumar Gupta, assistant campus chief, blames Tribhuvan University for taking away the campus’ revenue but not contributing towards developing its infrastructure.“The university only provides salaries for teachers,” said Gupta. “This makes it difficult for the campus to financially sustain itself.”Dr Pramod Kushwaha, the acting campus chief, agrees with Gupta, saying it’s difficult to run a campus on meagre funds that it has remaining after Tribhuvan University takes its cut.“Two new buildings need to be immediately constructed, and the female hostel is unusable,” said Kushwaha. “But Tribhuvan University doesn’t provide us with funds, except for salaries.”But these salaries too aren’t adequate, say teachers. Most lecturers are hired as contractors and paid according to the number of classes they teach, which is not fair to them, say the lecturers. They are paid around Rs300 per class, which is not enough, they say, which is why they are on strike.“We haven’t had a chance to study peacefully for the past four months,” Abhimanyu Prasad Panjiyar, a first-year BBS student, told the Post. “The campus doesn’t have a favourable atmosphere for education.”The college hardly has two classes on a regular academic day, according to Panjiyar.“Extra-curricular activities are virtually non-existent, and the teachers look disenchanted,” he said.  Shankar Acharya/TKPBut the teachers themselves are also to blame for the current state of the campus, say administrators. According to Mukesh Dwivedi, who is also a former chair of the campus’s Free Student Union, all of the lecturers teach elsewhere in private institutions, where they get paid more, and they are unable and unwilling to give time to Thakur Ram.“They reach 10 minutes ahead of class at private campuses but come half-an-hour late to Thakur Ram,” said Dwivedi.But all is not lost. Despite a lack of resources, the campus started its BBA programme last year, the first institution to do so in Province 2. Sanjay Shrestha, chief professor of the BBA programme, claims their results are outstanding with a pass rate of over 70 percent. The campus administration hopes to attract students from India too, as fees for the BBA programme at Thakur Ram is cheaper than that of Indian and Kathmandu colleges, according to Roshan Lamichhane, also an assistant campus chief.Kushwaha, the acting campus chief, also believes that there is room to be optimistic and that Thakur Ram, with its long history, will not go down just yet. There is interest from students, the campus’ academics remain of quality, and they even continue to provide annual scholarships to students with their own resources, he said.Kushwaha just wishes for more attention from Tribhuvan University, the country’s central university. He has been acting chief for over three years and if the university cared, it would’ve either made him full chief or removed him.“It is unbecoming to have an acting chief for so long,” he said.The administrators and many of the students remain optimistic that their campus can still be saved. But in order to prevent Thakur Ram from sliding into the ground, it is necessary for everyone—locals, political leaders, and civil society—to take an interest.“The campus has plenty of wealth, but it is not being utilised properly,” said Lamichhane. “If Thakur Ram is to keep its legacy, people need to care about it.”","Published at : February 26, 2020",Parsa,Shankar Acharya
Committee to settle land compensation dispute for Mechi-Mahakali Electric Railway,"Authorities have finally agreed to form a committee to settle the longstanding dispute regarding compensation pay for the land acquired to build the Mechi-Mahakali Electric Railway.The agitating locals of Betauna in Chandrapur Municipality, the local administration, the railway project and the people’s representatives reached an agreement on Friday to form the committee to re-evaluate the compensation amount.The committee comprises representatives of the railway project, the district administration office and the survey office, ward chairman of Chandrapur-8 in Rautahat and three local representatives. Residents of Betauna have been protesting for the past few months demanding a review of the compensation amount decided by the Compensation Fixation Committee of the East-West Electric Railway. They pitched tents on the plots to be acquired by the project and staged a sit-in.The protesting locals staged the sit-in at Betauna on Thursday and Friday. However, they called off the agitation after the representative of the Department of Railways, the chief district officer, lawmakers representing the district, and the chiefs of security agencies assured the agitating people that their demands would be addressed by forming the committee.“The Compensation Fixation Committee determined the compensation amount for the plots acquired to construct the railway stating that those lands are not connected by pathways and irrigation canals. The faulty report that prevented the local farmers from getting suitable compensation should be revised,” said lawmaker Deba Prasad Timilsina, adding that the new committee would revise the compensation amount.Stating that the compensation amount fixed by the committee is far less than the current value of land, the agitating locals had submitted memoranda to various government offices including the Ministry of Home Affairs through the District Administration Office, the Department of Railways, the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport to address their concerns.The compensation amount ranged from Rs 300,000 to Rs 1.6 million per kattha. But the landowners claim the current land price in the area is at least Rs 1 million per kattha.The agitating landowners claim that the committee members had inspected the field from a distance when the area was inundated in the rainy season.“They did not see the pathways and canals and prepared the report accordingly. The pathways and canals linking the lands should be mentioned. Our demand is to provide compensation for the land as per the current value of the land,” said Pradip Basnet, vice-chairman of the local struggle committee.The survey for the railway has been halted due to the agitation. “Work has been affected in the Betauna area due to the protest. We have been surveying the western part of Betauna now,” said Amit Rijal, the project manager of a construction company.Lumbini/Apex/Thani JV won the contract worth Rs 700 million in Rautahat. The 945 km Mechi-Mahakali Electric Railway is one of the government’s national pride projects.","Published at : February 25, 2020",Rautahat,Shiva Puri
Gaur Bazaar section of Malangawa road yet to be asphalted,"Manoj Thakur, a resident of Gaur Bazaar in Kabilashi Municipality, is allergic to dust. His doctor has advised him to avoid dust, but he hasn’t been able to follow the advice, as his house is adjacent to the dusty Malangawa-Nawalpur road section.“Everything in my house is always covered in a thin layer of dust. I shut the doors and windows to keep dust from entering, but that doesn’t help much. I have to wear a mask at all times, even when I’m indoors,” said Thakur.The 26km-long Malangawa-Nawalpur road stretch connects Malangawa, the district headquarters of Sarlahi, with the East-West Highway. Out of the 26 km, around 600 metres of the road section in Gaur Bazaar is yet to be asphalted.The locals in the area complain of poor health conditions because of air pollution caused by the dusty and dilapidated road section. The construction work of the road section has been left unattended for a long time, said Thakur.Every day, more than 100 vehicles pass through the road section. Umesh Kapad, a local, said the road sees a heavy flow of vehicles, including trucks and tractors. According to him, locals are suffering from respiratory diseases, common cold and eye problems due to the high level of dust particles in the air. “The dust pollution has reached a dangerous level these days,” Kapad said. The construction of the road, which had begun around 15 years ago, was put on hold after the locals of Gaur Bazaar asked the Postal Highway Office in Janakpur to construct a roadside drainage system before continuing with the work. “But neither the Postal Highway Office nor the contractor company has paid heed to our demands,” said Thakur.The Constitution of Nepal (2015) guarantees the right regarding a clean environment which states that each person shall have the right to live in a healthy and clean environment. Rajanikant Jha, a local civil society leader, said the right assured by the constitution has not been implemented in the bazaar area. “After several protests and obstructions, the concerned authority had finally agreed to build a roadside drainage system and complete the road’s construction. But the construction work has not gained momentum,” said Jha, blaming both government authorities and the contractor company for the delay in the work.Rajendra Prasad Das, chief at the Postal Highway Office in Janakpur, informed that his office has been talking with the Department of Roads to take initiatives for the construction of roadside drainage in Gaur Bazaar. “We are also talking with the department to extend the contract deadline since the contract period has already expired,” said Das. “The contractors were unable to asphalt Gaur road section on time due to various land disputes. But we will start blacktopping the road after the deadline’s extension.” A tender to blacktop the Malangawa-Nawalpur road was invited nine years ago with the financial assistance of the Indian government, but the project could not take off. After the end of the first tender’s deadline, the Department of Roads had reinvited a tender for the same road some five years ago.","Published at : February 20, 2020",Sarlahi,Om Prakash Thakur
School student found hanging in under-construction hostel building in Sarlahi,"A 15-year-old student was found hanging from the ceiling of an under-construction hostel building in Nabalpur, Sarlahi, on Monday, said Sarlahi district police.The eighth-grader at a Nabalpur-based private school was rushed to Namuna Hospital, but he was pronounced dead upon arrival.Family and relatives of the deceased alleged that the student died due to the negligence of the school administration.“The teachers used to severely beat my son time and again in the name of discipline. Even the class monitor would thrash him. My son died due to the negligence of the school,” said Asmin Kumar Chaudhary, the deceased’s father. He also claimed that a teacher had meted out severe punishment to him a few days ago. “A teacher removed his clothes and thrashed him in front of his friends,” said Chaudhary.The deceased, who is a resident of Gaushala in Mahottari district, was a hostel student at the school. According to the school administration, students and staff removed the bed sheet that he had used to hang himself and rushed him to the hospital.Meanwhile, the school has denied any wrongdoing. Sudip Karki, the school principal, claimed that the deceased student was stressed after his parents had come to visit him at the school a few days ago. “His parents came to the school on Monday. We had complained against him for repeatedly breaking the school’s rules and regulations, and his mother had berated him,” said Karki. He, however, admitted that the student was beaten by the hostel warden for creating a nuisance in the hostel. “He claimed to have seen a ghost in the hostel and was scaring other students with his stories.”Superintendent of Police Bishwamani Pokharel in Sarlahi said a detailed investigation into the death of the student is underway. “We are waiting for the post-mortem report to confirm his nature of death,” he said. Police handed over the body to the bereaved family on Tuesday. There are around 1,500 students in the school in the current academic year. Among them, nearly 400 students are staying in the school hostel.","Published at : February 20, 2020",Sarlahi,Om Prakash Thakur
Illegal crusher industry operating in Rameshwornath Community Forest in spite of ban,"Residents of Ramnagar Birta in Mahottari met Minister for Internal Affairs and Law in Province 2 Gyanendra Yadav on Monday and demanded the closure of illegal crusher industries that are in operation at the Rameshwornath Community Forest area and its vicinity.The provincial government had directed all crusher industries across the eight districts of Province 2 to close down following the death of Dilip Mahato, a 24-year-old man of Dhanusha who had been protesting the illegal mining of riverbed materials, on January 9. However, despite the directive, illegal mining is still ongoing in the stealth of the night, say locals. According to them, more than nine crusher industries in Ramnagar Birta of Bhangaha Municipality Ward No. 4 operate at night. The community forest falls under the President Chure-Tarai Madhesh Conservation and Development Project. Santosh Mahato, a local, said the locals have submitted a memorandum to the minister stating that the crushers have devastated the forestland and fertile farmlands nearby. “They dig sandpits about 30 feet deep and they carry out the excavation at night,” said Mahato.Birendra Mahato, chairman of the Rameshwornath Community Forest, said his office has been facing several death threats for trying to stop illegal excavation. “Despite the death threats, we have come to the ministry demanding the closure of illegal crusher industries in the Rameshwornath Community Forest area.”Minister Yadav said that the locals have directed the Chief District Officer of Mahottari to monitor the district’s illegal crusher industries. “The excavation of riverbed materials has been prohibited in the province,” said Yadav, adding that his ministry has asked crusher industry operators to submit their documents for inquiry. According to him, the internal investigation of crushers is underway.Likewise, haphazard excavation of riverbed materials is still ongoing on the banks of Ratu river despite a ban imposed by the District Monitoring Committee in Dhanusha on January 21. In the eastern part of Ratu in Dhanusha, there are more than 10 crushers within a kilometre of the bank area. “Monitoring teams from the District Monitoring Committee, District Administration Committee and District Police Office conduct inspections during the day but the crushers start their operation at night,” said Hiralal Mahato, a local resident.","Published at : February 12, 2020",Dhanusha,Santosh Singh
Students receive practical lessons in agriculture farm,"Ashmita Syangtan, a ninth-grader at Mahadev Janata Secondary School in Hariban Municipality, works in an agriculture farm on her school premises. She has been receiving practical education at the school farm, she says. “We were taught about vegetable farming in our classes. We have been implementing that education practically on the farm. Practical education has helped us understand the course better,” Shyangtan said.Risika Karki, Syangtan’s classmate, said she and her classmates regularly attend the practical classes on the farm. Like Syangtan and Karki, 40 other students of grade nine have enrolled in the Bali Bigyan (Crops Science) course.The school started the course from the current academic year. “Students have started a mushroom farm and they also grow cauliflower and cabbage,” said Nabina Gahatraj, a trainer of the course. “We have started growing mushrooms and cauliflowers commercially. Mushrooms produced by students are sold at Rs 150 per kg from the school’s counter.”In the coming days, students will be growing cucumber and various other vegetables, Gahatraj said. Meanwhile, students say the practical lessons have motivated them to study well.“We can practically implement the things that we learn in textbooks,” said Karki. “We have also learnt a skill that will help us gain income in the future. We can cultivate crops and vegetables in our own land and sell them.”Jaya Shankar Singh, the school’s headmaster, said the institution started the course after the Department of Education provided it with Rs 2.6 million grant in the current academic year. “We purchased agricultural equipment worth around Rs 1.6 million. The remaining amount is being used for building a lab,” said Singh. “The course has gained popularity among students.”","Published at : February 10, 2020",Sarlahi,Om Prakash Thakur
"Rautahat poorest district in Province 2, policy commission says","Rautahat is the district with most municipalities in the country, with 16 municipalities out of 18 local units. It is also a district with one of the lowest Human Development Index ratings—0.387—in the country, which is lower than that of several districts in the Karnali such as Jumla, Dolpa and Mugu. And, according to a recent report released by Province 2’s Policy Commission, it is the multi-dimensionally poorest and least literate district in the province. It has 46.43 percent of its population under the multidimensional poverty index (MPI) and 58 percent illiterate population, including 45 percent male and 63 percent female.According to the report, Mahottari and Sarlahi are the second and third multi-dimensionally poorest districts, respectively, in the province. On average, the district has a multidimensional poverty index of 47.9, much lesser than the national average of 28.60. MPI takes into account multiple deprivations at the individual and household level in health, education and standard of living, among others. Among other districts in the province, Saptari has 0.437 MPI, Siraha 0.408, Dhanusha 0.431, Mahottari 0.388 and Sarlahi 0.402. Bara and Parsa have 0.386 and 0.464 MPIs. The province has an economic poverty index of 27.7 percent. This is the third poorest rating in the country. The province recently introduced a five-year plan to improve its economic poverty index to 21 percent.Chief Minister Mohammad Lalbabu Raut said his government is using its entire resources to reduce poverty in the province. “Going by the indexes, we have a lot to do and we are up for it,” said Raut while on a recent trip to Rautahat. Rautahat is home to one of the most underprivileged tribes in the country—the Musahars. The hundred Musahar households of Chandrapur Municipality-9 do not own any land, with most of them working at nearby brick kilns. According to Sukhal Musahar, a resident of Chandrapur, he and his neighbours work for 10 hours a day for which they get paid Rs600; the women get paid Rs500. “We are surviving on this, but when we don’t get work, we have to sleep hungry,” he said.Bijay Kishore Jha, a social worker, said there are many underprivileged settlements in the district whose members depend on labour work for survival. “The people of underprivileged communities such as the Musahar engage in menial work from very early in life. They don’t have the time and resources to get an education,” Jha said, pointing to the reason behind the district’s high illiteracy rate. “Corruption is widespread in local units.”Devprasad Timalsina, a lawmaker from the Nepali Congress, said that many drives to improve the district’s status in education and health sectors have been ineffective. “The facilities aimed for underprivileged communities are interfered with by those with access,” he said. “Government services haven’t reached where they are intended. The condition of infrastructure is poor. Discriminations based on caste and gender are rife, and superstitions are still widespread. Given these reasons, it’s not surprising that the district fares poorly in socio-economic indexes.”The Poverty Alleviation Fund, a state-owned body working towards reducing poverty, has invested Rs 8million in the district in the 11 years that it’s been active. The Fund had established 2,385 small committees to reduce poverty. But the drives seem to have little effect.Ram Ekwal Rae Yadav, chair of the District Coordination Committee, said the main problem behind the growing rate of poverty in the district is unemployment. “The district does not have enough industries. The quality of education is on the decline. Floods affect the district every year,” he said. “And lately, arable lands are left barren owing to uneven patterns of the rain.”","Published at : February 6, 2020",Rautahat,Shiva Puri
Illegal extraction of riverbed materials goes unchecked,"In a bid to control illegal mining of sand and other construction materials, the local administration in Sarlahi closed the crusher plants in the district a few months ago. But illegal extraction of construction aggregate has been continuing in the district, particularly in the Chure region.On Tuesday, a monitoring team led by Chief District Officer Mohan Bahadur GC seized two excavators and as many tractors from a sand mining site at Patauna stream in Hariaun. “The excavators and tractors were handed over to the concerned local level for legal action,” said GC.According to some locals, illegal sand mining has been going on unchecked because the local units have failed to take action against illegal miners.Following complaints of rampant sand mining and deforestation in the Chure region, a team, led by Ram Chandra Mandal, chairman of Natural Resources and Environment Committee of Province 2 assembly, had monitored the Chure area eight months ago. The committee discovered illegal extraction of sand and stones taking place in several rivers and streams in the Chure area.“Smuggling of sand and stone in the Chure area has worried us. Because of the remoteness of the area, it is difficult to stop the problem,” said Manoj Kumar Devkota, mayor of Ishworpur Municipality. He, along with other municipal officials, inspected the Chure area on Wednesday. Devkota said illegal mining and smuggling of construction aggregate cannot be controlled without locals’ support.Meanwhile, the local administration in Makwanpur is preparing to shut down 36 sand mines and six crusher plants for violating the industry regulations. The district monitoring committee had inspected the sand mines and crusher plants in various parts of the district on Monday and Tuesday.Chief District Officer Narayan Prasad Bhatta said preparations were underway to close the sand mines and crusher plants for not adhering to the regulations enforced by the district council meeting.(Pratap Bista contributed reporting from Hetauda)","Published at : February 6, 2020",Sarlahi,Om Prakash Thakur
Parsa police take harsh measure to control drugs smuggling,"A police team on Sunday raided Umesh Sahani’s house in the Malahi settlement of Parsa. The security personnel seized 10kg marijuana and a cash of Rs 148,000 and IRs 20,000. Sahani is at large.The District Police Office in Parsa, in a bid to control the production and smuggling of drugs, is preparing to take the harshest measure—confiscation of Sahani’s house and property. “The legal process to confiscate the house and properties of Sahani is underway. It is possibly the strongest action to be taken on a drug case in the district. Such action will discourage other drug smugglers as well,” said Gautam Thapa, deputy superintendent of police. He asserted that the police administration will be taking strong action against drug smugglers to curb the illegal activity in the district. “Most drug smugglers run away and hide, so the next step for the police is to confiscate their belongings to deter them from committing the crime again,” said Thapa. According to Thapa, clause 6 of the Narcotic Drugs (Control) Act 1976 clearly states that the authority can seize the house and vehicle used in the smuggling and transportation of drugs. Sahani, according to police, is a notorious drug smuggler involved in the crime for the past few years. Police have charged him of smuggling marijuana and other drugs to bordering Indian markets. The cultivation and smuggling of marijuana and other drugs are unchecked in Parsa, a central Tarai district bordering with India. A security source said smugglers have been using Parsa as a transit point to smuggle drugs produced in Makwanpur and Dhading to India.Each year, the local administration launches a drive to destroy marijuana farms and detain the producers and smugglers, but to no avail. Police destroyed marijuana crops planted in 29 katthas of land, seized 392kg marijuana and arrested 25 people within the past six months. Last fiscal year, police destroyed marijuana planted in 50 katthas of land.Induced by drug smugglers, some local farmers plant marijuana in the middle of their sugarcane fields and in public land to avoid getting caught, said police.","Published at : February 5, 2020",Parsa,Shankar Acharya
Saptari Armed Police Force starts adding border security outposts,"The district Armed Police Force has launched a drive to add border outposts with an objective to make border security more effective. According to Deputy Inspector General of Armed Police Force, Saptari, Raju Aryal, the outposts are being added to curb illegal smuggling of goods, crime, and ensure a robust border security.Inaugurating an outpost at Bode Barsain, in Saptari, on Sunday, DIG Aryal said that it was necessary to add the outposts as Nepal shares a 464km-long border with India in Province 2. The APF is building 17 new structures, taking the total number of border outposts to 69.Saptari, which shares a 78 km-long open border with India, currently has six outposts. Three more outposts will be added at Belhi and Yoginiya in the district.There will be one outpost in every 8.6km on average following the completion of the drive which will make the border security more effective, Aryal said.“The number of outposts as per the distance is more than that of India’s,” Aryal said. “We will keep on adding more outposts as needed.”Aryal added that there is still a confusion regarding the no man’s land at the border. “Today, for a lack of ample security, locals have been protecting the border themselves,” he said, elaborating on their plan. “In the first round, a no man’s land will be separated in Rautahat, Bara, Sarlahi and Saptari districts.”Lately, the border police have started 24-hour patrols of the area, according to Aryal. “It’s high time that we checked on smuggling and cross-border crimes,” Aryal said. “We need to carve out a clear border line and make the border area properly managed. This latest drive is an attempt towards that end.”","Published at : February 3, 2020",Rajbiraj,Abdesh Kumar Jha
"Easy loans in Province 2 for labour migrants could encourage youths to leave country, experts say","Province 2’s decision to provide subsidised loans for outbound workers has drawn mixed reactions from labour migration experts.The Province 2 government has made arrangements for issuing up to Rs150,000 in loans to migrant workers at lower interest rates via two commercial banks. As the scheme came into effect, nine aspiring migrant workers received bank loans amidst a ceremony in Janakpur on Thursday.According to Province 2 Social Development Minister Nawal Kishor Sah, the arrangements were made to provide financial relief for youths who choose to go abroad in search of better opportunities.“This is not a programme as such but an agreement reached between the Province 2 government and the banks for providing money to youths going abroad,” Sah told the Post. “This will provide much-needed relief to youths who had to borrow money from local lenders at exorbitant rates for funding their departure.”Youths from eights districts of Province 2 will be eligible for the loan. Prabhu Bank will serve outbound migrant workers from Saptari, Sarlahi, Rautahat, Bara and Parsa districts whereas Nepal SBI Bank will provide loans to youths from Siraha, Dhanusha and Mahottari. At least 10,000 youths will benefit from the scheme, according to Sah.The interest rates will vary for different categories of people. For marginalised groups like Dalits, the interest rate will be only 5 percent, and for other groups, it will be 11 percent, according to the minister.“Aspiring migrant workers had to mortgage their lands and other property and those without such assets had to take loans at 36 percent rate,” said Sah. “For accessing loans under this scheme, they do not need to keep anything as collateral.”The provincial government’s move to fund migration of youths comes as a surprise for experts in the field and has generated a mixed response from them.According to labour migration researchers, the move to provide subsidised loans will surely benefit youths from Province 2.Youths from Province 2 were compelled to take loans at higher rates for financing their foreign employment, said Swarna Kumar Jha, a labour migration researcher. “Subsidised loans will help them in getting the required money at cheaper rates.”Another labour migration researcher Arjun Kharel, who is associated with the Centre for the Study of Labour and Mobility, a think tank, also welcomes the initiative for it will provide loans at cheaper rates.“During our studies, we have found that people had taken loans at even 60 percent for going abroad,” said Kharel. “At least, these people will get loans at lower rates. This is good from the workers’ welfare point of view.”However, these experts fear that easily accessible loans might lead to a surge in labour migration from the region. The move is also significant especially because the central government has been talking about slowly controlling labour migration.Since coming to power, the KP Sharma Oli administration has repeatedly said foreign employment is not a priority and in the next five years, Nepali workers would not be compelled to migrate due to the lack of jobs at home.“The loan scheme opens the door for those people who could not go on foreign employment because of financial issues,” said Jha, who also coordinates the National Network for Safe Migration, an umbrella body of organisations working in the sector. “This can mean financial opportunities for them but will also see a rise in people migrating abroad.”These concerns from experts come from the fact that eight districts of Province 2 are among the top labour exporters in the country. Around 24 percent of workers who had received labour permits from the Nepal government between fiscal years 2008/09 and 2016/17 were from Province 2. Out of the top 10 most labour sending districts, five were from Province 2 as of the end of fiscal year 2018-19.“We cannot completely stop labour migration to foreign countries straight away,” said Sah. “For discouraging the trend, we have to first give them employment and skills. Providing skills and then work is likely to take time. Therefore, we are working on both sides—facilitating labour migration and creating jobs inside the province.”According to Minister Sah, Province 2 government has also come up with programmes to provide cost-free skills training for youths and give seed money to those who want to start their own enterprise inside the Province. The Social Development Ministry has allocated Rs80 million for providing seed money. Besides, the provincial government also launched heavy equipment training this week and has plans of training nearly 5,000 youths for three months.“We are making sure that unemployed people get work here as well. Those who still want to go abroad should receive training so that they do not suffer abroad,” said Sah.However, migration experts also reckon that providing a loan can not only see a surge in the number of individuals from Province 2 going abroad but it can also alter the whole trend of labour migration.“There are still people from Province 2 who go to India for work whereas others migrate to other parts of the country,” said Kharel. “With the funds available, even seasonal migrants will opt for long-term migration to Gulf countries and Malaysia.”","Published at : February 2, 2020",Kathmandu,Chandan Kumar Mandal
A basic school in Rajbiraj fails to attract students,"On paper, Bal Mandir Basic School in Rajbiraj has a total of 65 students—47 from grade one to five and 18 in the child development centre of the institution. But the school, which runs classes from grade one to five, only has 13 students attending classes regularly.The municipality has allocated a budget of Rs 1.5 million this fiscal year to the school, which has two teachers for grade one to five and an additional teacher for its child development centre. The school has four classrooms and can accommodate around 100 students, but on Tuesday morning, all 13 students were basking in the sun while a teacher was taking a collective class. “Since the number of students is less, we decided it’s better to teach all of them together,” said Shanti Jha, the principal of the school. But what the principal has not taken into consideration is the impact it has on the students’ learning capacity. Bishnu Yadav, a local who studied in the school up to grade five, said, “The students in this school are behind the lesson plan. The teachers do not teach properly. How can you when you put students from different grades in one class.”According to the Education Unit of Rajbiraj Municipality, a total of Rs1,142,037 is spent annually for the salary of teachers and an office assistant at the school. Besides that, the school also receives Rs135,000 for the mid-day meal programme, Rs13,700 to purchase textbooks for students, Rs15,000 as the management expenditure, Rs150 per student to buy stationeries, Rs17,200 for scholarship to the students, Rs10,000 for auditing accounts, Rs40,000 to buy uniforms for the teachers and Rs500 per student in child development centre to buy necessary educational materials.“The performance of Bal Mandir Basic School is almost nil in light of the investment it has received. Such under-performing schools are the reason why the municipality faces challenges to meet its education goals,” said Bhogendra Yadav, chief at the education unit of Rajbiraj Municipality.Acknowledging the extremely poor academic performance of the school, Mayor Shambhu Yadav said that he plans to merge the school with another soon and resolve the problem. “The merger is on hold due to some legal hurdles. We will initiate a merger within a month,” said Yadav. The locals believe that the school does not provide quality education, so they prefer not sending their wards to the school. “The school does not have co-curricular and extracurricular activities for the students. There is no learning environment,” said Bishnu, the ex-student. “The local unit and the concerned authorities should also monitor the school regularly. They should take action too because as long as there are no consequences, the school will continue to underperform.”","Published at : January 30, 2020",Rajbiraj,Abdhesh Kumar Jha
Locals face hardship as road project in Janakpur keeps missing deadline,"The construction of the Kadamchowk-Kamala section of the Postal Highway in Janakpur started in 2016, but it is far from complete.

Jaya Prakash Mahato, a resident of Kamala who travels to Janakpur daily, is at his wit’s end trying to make his way through the sludge-filled road section. “I teach at a boarding school in Janakpur. Travelling through that road every day is a nightmare,” said Mahato.According to the project office of the Postal Highway Directorate in Janakpur, the total length of the Kadamchowk-Kamala road section is 30.58 kilometres. The contractor company, Lama/Raman Construction Company JV, on July 15, 2016, had agreed to blacktop 25 kilometres of the road by the end of the last fiscal year. Meanwhile, Dhukuchu Construction Pvt. Ltd, another contractor company, in July 2017 had agreed to construct the remaining 5.58 kilometres of the road by mid-January 2019. But the construction work is far from complete. Rajendra Das, chief at the Janakpur Postal Highway Project Office, said only 55 percent of the construction work has been completed so far. “The project office extended the deadline time and again, but the construction work has not gained momentum,” said Das. “The contractor companies cite locals’ obstruction and lack of construction materials for the delay.”According to the project office of the Postal Highway Directorate, the office is going to extend the deadline for the construction work by a year again. “Only 11 kilometres of the road has been blacktopped so far. We have no choice but to extend the deadline,” Das said. The total cost of the project is Rs700 million, according to the project office of the Postal Highway Directorate. The Post tried to contact the representatives of the contractor companies, but they were not available for comment.The Kadamchowk-Kamala section of the Postal Highway is the shortest way to connect the eastern villages of Dhanusha district with Siraha district’s headquarters. “During monsoons, we have no other option but to use the Jayanagar-Jatahi route on the Indian side to reach Janakpur, as the road gets muddy during rainfall,” said Mahato.","Published at : January 26, 2020",Dhanusha,Santosh Singh

Krishna was collecting fodder in the nearby field when the boar attacked her,” said Bachchha Yadav, Krishna’s uncle. According to him, wild animals frequently enter settlements and destroy crops.Kachorwa, which lies near the Nepal-India border in Simraungadh Municipality Ward No. 8 of Bara, is around 40km south of the Chure forests. Locals say wildlife, including wild boars, blue bulls, deer and monkeys, has started entering settlements and wreaking havoc of late. “Wild animals destroy crops planted in hectares of land. Big animals generally do not venture into the settlements; it’s the smaller ones like wild boars and blue bulls that terrorise us. The forest office and the national park are indifferent towards our problems,” said Pannalal Das, a farmer of Piprabirta in Mahagadhimai Municipality. According to conservationists, wild animals have started moving south to the settlements that border India, as water sources in the Chure forest region are drying up. Rampant deforestation and haphazard extraction of sand and pebbles in the Chure range in the past few years have led to a depletion of water sources.“Water level in various rivers and rivulets have gradually started decreasing due to rampant deforestation and exploitation of riverbed materials. Chure forests, until a few years back, had several sources of water, but most have dried up now. Wild animals are moving south in search of water,” said Rabindra Singh, chairman of Halkhoriya Collaborative Forest Management Committee.Amir Maharjan, chief of Parsa National Park, admits that a shortage of water sources is forcing wild animals to move south towards the no-man’s-land. “The population of wild animals is also on the rise, which is good news, but we must manage proper habitat to accommodate the growing number,” said Maharjan. According to him, the number of animals like deer, tiger, leopard, wild boar, monkey and the blue bull has increased significantly in the past few years.There were four tigers in the area during the tiger census held in 2010. The latest census conducted in 2018 showed 18 tigers in the park forests. It is estimated that there are around 60 to 65 elephants and four to six rhinos in the area. The government in 2017 declared Parsa Wildlife Reserve as Parsa National Park. The park occupies 627 square kilometre area, including the forests of Parsa, Bara and Makwanpur.Conservationists have stressed on the need to preserve water sources in the Chure region in order to conserve the wildlife and prevent them from entering human settlements.“The authorities concerned should immediately make plans and policies to address this issue. Big animals like elephant, rhino and tiger will also start entering human settlements if the problem is not addressed at the earliest,” said Baburam Gopali, a former warden of the park.","Published at : January 22, 2020",Bara,Laxmi Sah
"Tourists come to Janakpur in droves, but stay only for a day","The number of tourists has increased considerably in Janakpudham in recent months, say tourism entrepreneurs. Hotels and Dharmashalas—rest houses for pilgrims— in the area are being fully occupied by tourists. According to hotel operators, the arrival of Indian tourists has increased four-fold in the last two months. However, a lack of proper infrastructures, such as signages, toilets and street signs, to support tourism has put a limit on tourist movement.Most tourists pay a visit to Janakpurdham after visiting popular destinations in Kathmandu and Pokhara, but they don’t spend more than a day in Janakpur, say tourism entrepreneurs. “The campaigns to promote tourism are terrible. Most tourists who come here aren’t even aware of Visit Nepal 2020,” said Jibnath Chaudhary, the operator of Sita Palace Hotel in Janakpur Sub-Metropolitan City Ward No. 8.There are no banners, signages or tourist guides to help visitors find their way around the city, leaving most perplexed for lack of clear indications as to where to go and how to get there. Read: Once upon a time in JanakpurMany tourists complained that they have to repeatedly ask locals for the direction to reach the Janaki Temple from Gopal Dharmashala, which is not more than 300 metres away from the temple.""Our bus driver had to roam around for an hour to reach Gopal Dharmashala, as there were no street signs or clear directions,"" said Radhe Shyam Mishra, who had come from Madhya Pradesh in India. ""It would be very helpful for tourists if there were proper direction signages for dharmashalas, temples and other tourist destinations in the city.""Every day seven to fifteen tourist buses arrive in Gopal Dharmashala, the oldest Dharmashala in the area. Most of the tourists are from the Indian states of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. Each bus has at least 60 passengers, including the driver and bus conductor.""Our normal flow is five tourist buses per day,"" said Raj Kumar Jha, the managing director of Gopal Dharmashala. ""But these days, we receive around 20 buses in a day.""Many Indian pilgrims visit Janakpur between the months of December and mid- February. “The leisure from agricultural activities and the weather prompt the people from India to visit Janakpur during this time of the year,” said Jha.Most of the big hotels and lodges, including Paglababa Dharmashala, Marwadi Sewa Samiti, Rauniyaar Dharmashala and Kalwar Sewa Samiti, are fully occupied with domestic and foreign tourists during this time of the year.Highlighting the possibility of religious tourism taking off in Province 2, Lalbabu Raut, the province’s chief minister, said, ""We have introduced plans and policies related to the reconstruction, beautification, and management of religious sites of Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists, Sikhs, and Jains.""In light of Raut’s commitment to promoting religious tourism in the province and given the severe lack of tourism infrastructure, Manish Jha, coordinator of the Visit Nepal 2020 campaign in Province 2, said that the committee has directed the sub-metropolis to work towards facilitating tourists. ""We have requested Janakpur Sub-metropolitan City to fix street signs and direction signboards to help tourists find their way around the city,"" said Jha.The Post tried to reach the mayor of the sub-metropolis, Lal Kishor Sah, but he was unavailable for comment. Janakpur is also called the city of 52 temples and 72 lakes. But most visitors are unaware of the many tourist destinations in the province, so they return home after visiting some temples in Janakpur. According to Raut, the beautification process of Janaki Temple in Janakpur, Chhinamasta Temple in Saptari, Rauja Majar in Mahottari and Gadhimai in Bara will start soon.Locals believe that the duration of a visitor’s stay can be prolonged if the process of informing tourists about tourist destinations is streamlined. Sunil Mallik, an expert in Mithila culture, said Janakpur is the place of origin of Mithila culture, and that besides temples, Mithila art and literature should also be promoted to cater to tourists who visit Janakpur.""We can attract more tourists by informing them about Mithila foods, culture, customs and traditions,"" said Mallik. “But more importantly, we should focus on making the city more tourist-friendly and easy to navigate.”","Published at : January 14, 2020",Janakpur,Shyam Sundar Shashi
Dilip Mahato was attacked before being run over by a tipper truck: Police,"Dilip Mahato, a 24-year-old youth who had been protesting against illegal mining of riverbed material for two years, was dragged and killed by a tipper truck in the wee hours of Friday. Police have so far arrested four individuals in connection with the murder. The site of the incident lay 200m away from the Churiyamai Crusher Industry. Once the truck dragged and crushed Mahato to death, the driver of the truck, Munindra Mahato, drove the vehicle back to the industry site, police said. The blood from the killing smeared the trail all the way to the industry. The police have seized the tipper truck and cordoned off the spot where the truck was parked after the alleged murder. “Security has been deployed at the site of the crusher industry; the area is cordoned off,” SP Ramesh Basnet, chief of Dhanusha Police told the Post. “The investigation will get easier once we receive the results of the blood test.”Dhanusha Police on Monday sent the blood sample to Nepal Police’s Biddhi Science Lab for a forensic test.Before Dilip was crushed, he was injured with a lever of the truck, police said after recording statements from the alleged perpetrators. Police have intensified search for the truck’s conductor, who is on the run following the murder.“It’s apparent that the conductor of the tipper has a hand in planning and attacking Dilip,” SP Basnet said. “We are currently trying to locate him. Once he’s arrested, we will have more details about the incident.”Police have also said they are investigating the involvement of Shyam Babu Yadav and Roshan Yadav, two of Dilip’s friends who had left along with Dilip from his home in Sripur. “Roshan has given contradictory statements about the incident and Shyam had returned halfway to the industry site—the reasons why they are being suspected of complicity in the case,” police said.According to Inspector Ramkumar Yadav, who has been investigating the case from the beginning, the owners of the industry, Bipin and Binod Mahato, and the tipper driver were inebriated with alcohol since the preceding night. Bottles of alcohol, snacks, and used utensils have been discovered in one room of the industry’s block. “When Dilip was spotted at the site, the inebriated owners warned him saying, ‘If only you disturb us…’ and then proceeded to hit him with the lever of the truck,” inspector Yadav said. “When Dilip collapsed on the floor, Bipin incited the tipper driver to run the vehicle over Dilip’s body, offering him a bribe of Rs50,000. He even assured the driver to release him if he was jailed.”In his statement to police, the driver, Munindra Mahato, has conceded that he killed Bipin by reversing the truck.Four days after the incident, the Province 2 government has pledged compensation of Rs500,000 to the victim’s family. “A cabinet meeting held on Monday condemned the murder of Dilip Mahato, while protesting against illegal mining of riverbed materials. It also pledged to extend financial help to the victim’s family,” said Gyanendra Yadav, provincial government spokesperson and Minister of Law and Internal Affairs.On Sunday, the National Human Rights Commission released a statement calling for an impartial and effective investigation into the case.","Published at : January 14, 2020",Janakpur,Ajit Tiwari
Indian side constructs unauthorised gate on no man’s land on Thadi border point,"On January 5, protests broke out in the border town of Thadi when Indian authorities started unauthorised construction of a gate a day prior on no man’s land along the Nepal-India border in Siraha district.As the protests grew, a joint survey team of Nepal and India was formed to inspect the disputed area last week. “The construction is taking place within four metres of the no-man’s-land, which violates international border rules. We have asked the Indian side to stop construction immediately,” said Umesh Kumar, chief survey officer of Province 2, who led the Nepali team during the joint inspection of the disputed structure. Thadi is a trading point between Nepal and India, located 18 kilometres south from Lahan, the district headquarters of Siraha.Chief District Officer of Siraha Gopal Kumar Adhikari said that the local administration called the survey team to prepare a map of the area after it was informed about the unilateral construction of the structure by the Indian side on the no man’s land. We have informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Survey Department about the matter as well, he added.According to Kumar, the map has been prepared and handed over to the local administration. Nepali people in Thadi further complained that the Indian authorities have been operating a customs office on no-man’s-land for years. “We have repeatedly requested the authorities to remove the Indian customs office but to no avail. Now people have erected around a dozen thatched-roof huts on both sides of the no-man’s-land as well,” said Kanhaiya Bhatta, a local of Thadi.","Published at : January 12, 2020",Siraha,Bharat Jargha Magar
Alleged perpetrators of Dhanusha tipper attack remanded into custody,"Four of the alleged perpetrators of the tipper attack in Dhanusha have been remanded in judicial custody for five days. The Dhanusha District Court on Sunday issued the order to keep the accused—Bipin Mahato, Munindra Mahato, Jitendra Mahato and Roshan Kumar Yadav—in custody pending a police investigation. Police had nabbed the four men in connection to the murder of 24-year-old Dilip Mahato of Sripur. Dilip was crushed to death by a tipper truck on Friday morning, following his protests against the illegal mining of riverbed materials near his home in Sripur. The alleged perpetrators have been charged with a homicide case, said Superintendent of Police Ramesh Kumar Basnet.Basnet added that the police on Sunday started taking statements from the alleged perpetrators. “We have remanded the alleged perpetrators in custody for five days and are currently taking their statements,” Basnet said. “More information will be revealed after the statements are recorded.”Meanwhile, the National Human Rights Commission on Sunday issued a press release calling for an impartial and effective investigation into the murder of Mahato. “Our attention has been drawn to reports that environment activist and human rights defender Om Prakash Mahato [Dilip] of Mithila Municipality Ward No. 5 of Dhanusha was crushed to death by a tripper truck in the Aurahi River in the district on January 10,” reads the statement. According to the statement, a team from the NHRC in Province 2 will inspect the incident site and investigate the incident. The incident is against human rights and the multilateral treaty adopted by the United Nations in 1966, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, of which Nepal is a signatory, said the human rights watchdog.“The government should conduct an impartial and effective investigation into the case; provide compensation to the victim's family, and punish the perpetrator(s) according to law and make all the efforts not to let such incident repeat in the future.”","Published at : January 12, 2020",Dhanusha,Santosh Singh
A parched Chure village in Sarlahi is finally connected to a water supply system,"On Friday, locals of Kerabari in Hariwon Municipality welcomed their local representatives with fanfare as their village was supplied with water.“Every morning, our first concern used to be managing the water,” said Hem Kumari Rai, a local of Chure in Kerabari. “We have been facing this ordeal for as long as we remember.”On top of that, the water from the Purbeli river is impure, said Rai, and the locals had to trek for about two hours to bring the water. “The new facility has changed our life,” Rai added. “We are very happy.” The water supply project benefits 65 households in the village.Chure locals said they were disappointed for the water crisis even after the village became part of the municipality.“Now the representatives look concerned about the crisis and we welcome it,” said Durga Rai, another local.The new project makes use of the ‘lift technology’, which pumps water from its source to the tank, from where it’s distributed to the households. In Chure, a 7.5HP motor powered by a 15KV generator lifts the water off the Fatti river. The water is collected in two tanks constructed in the village.Krishna Bahadur Rai, chief of the drinking water consumers’ committee, said that the project’s construction in the village was not easy. “The uneven topography and the location of the village on a hilltop meant we needed to use the expensive lift technology,” he said. “But it was possible when the municipality invested about Rs3 million.”Mayor Ganesh Prasain said clean drinking water is a right granted by the constitution and the local unit was committed to guaranteeing it.“For a lack of clean drinking water, the settlement was exposed to the risks of various health hazards like cholera,” Prasain said. “Now the settlement is safe and the people are happy.”","Published at : January 11, 2020",Sarlahi,Om Prakash Thakur
Youth crushed to death by tipper for protesting illegal extraction of riverbed materials in Dhanusa,"Early morning on Friday, when 24-year-old Dilip Kumar Mahato heard the raucous clamour of loaders and tippers coming from the Aurahi River behind his house, he immediately went to investigate.Dilip knew that the illegal extraction of construction material from the riverbed had been ongoing for the past two years. He had been protesting ever since it started, and he had repeatedly gotten into disputes with people from the crusher industry. He had received death threats and when he showed no signs of backing down, they had tried to bribe him.Read: Why sand mining is rampant and what’s (not) being done to control itFor locals of Sripur in Dhanusha’s Mithila Municipality, Dilip’s continued protests and his fight against the crusher industry was nothing new.But on Friday, things took a tragic turn. As Dilip protested yet again before a tipper that was illegally harvesting the riverbed, the truck ran him over, dragging him under its carriage. Dilip died.Inspector Ram Kumar Yadav of the Dhalkebar Area Police Office confirmed that Dilip was killed while protesting the illegal extraction of riverbed materials. “He was forcefully dragged and crushed by the tipper,” Yadav told the Post.The Dhalkebar Area Police Office has taken the driver, along with the tipper with registration number Na 7 Kha 6413, into custody. Dilip’s body has been sent to the Janakpur-based Provincial Hospital for a post-mortem, according to Yadav.“There were frequent altercations between the locals and the owners of the crusher industry,” said Yadav. “From our preliminary investigation, we have inferred that Dilip was killed following one such altercation.” Dilip had returned home only two weeks ago from Bhopal in India, where he was pursuing a bachelors engineering degree. Dilip was in the last semester of his course and about to graduate.From the very beginning, Dilip had argued that harvesting the river of its sand, stones and boulders would place his village at risk of flooding. Dilip’s relatives said he was repeatedly threatened but he took it lightly. “The contractors would threaten him and often try to bribe him,” said Birendra Kumar Mahato, his older brother. “But succumbing to threats and bribes was unlike him. He continued to speak out about illegal mining.”Last year, Dilip had even informed local journalists about the mining and after the news broke, the mining stopped for a few days, Birendra said. But it restarted.“When he returned home two weeks ago, he wanted to stop the illegal mining permanently and once again got into fights with the crusher owners,” said Birendra. “Even our father was threatened by one of the owners, Bipin Mahato, on Wednesday.”According to Inspector Yadav, Bipin Mahato is currently on the run, along with a few others associated with the industry.According to Sanjay Kumar Mahato, a neighbour, Dilip was a friendly person and popular among villagers. “He was interested in politics so he was outspoken and wanted to solve problems in the village,” said Sanjay.Following the incident, locals obstructed the East-West Highway on Friday afternoon protesting Dilip’s murder.The story has been updated.","Published at : January 10, 2020",Dhanusa,Santosh Singh
Siraha District Administration Office evicts illegal settlers along East-West Highway,"The District Administration Office in Sarlahi has started the eviction of illegal settlers living on encroached public land along the East-West Highway.Houses, temporary structures or shanties, built on encroached land on either side of the highway, spanning 42 kilometres from Bandipur to Lahan, had started to turn into permanent structures a few years ago. The administration has coordinated with the local units (Lahan, Golbazaar, Mirchaiya and Karjanha Municipalities) to recover the land along the highway (Bandipur to Lahan in Siraha). Gopal Kumar Adhikari, chief district officer, said they have started the eviction to curb rampant encroachment. “We have to evict settlers from the highway area due to the increased pressure of vehicles along the road,” said Adhikari. An increase in human traffic along the highway has led to an increase in road accidents in the area, according to Adhikari. More than 500 huts have been constructed in the highway area. These huts have primarily been set up to conduct businesses like running eateries and shops, and the area has begun to resemble a small busy bazaar. Preferring anonymity, one of the settlers said they had been running their businesses (fruit shops, eateries, hotels among others) along the highway area for the last 15 years and had never been asked to move. “The authorities destroyed our shops and houses without providing any alternatives to us. We have been living here for so many years and now we have been asked to move,” he said. According to the provision of the Department of Roads, it is illegal to build a structure 25 metres on either side of the East-West Highway. But the immediate vicinity of the East-West Highway has turned into bustling settlements in the last few years.Fifteen days ago, the local units had informed settlers (who had constructed houses, huts and shops among others within 25 metres of the highway) to move away from the area. After settlers refused to follow the orders, the administration used bulldozers to demolish the huts and houses starting Tuesday.Authorities said that it will take at least seven days to remove illegal houses and huts, among other infrastructure, from the highway. Devnath Sah, mayor of Golbazaar Municipality, said that they are also going to manage weekly markets (which operate near the highway). “We have also imposed a ban on storing construction materials (pebbles, sand, among others) along the road area,” said Sah, adding that the highway area will be cleared within seven days.","Published at : January 10, 2020",Siraha,Bharat Jarghamagar

"Electricity poles were installed in Rautahat local units, but electric wires yet to be fixed","Around 700 utility poles have been installed in Chandrapur, Brindaban and Gujara municipalities in the last five months. But the process of installing wires is yet to start. The concerned authority has left the work in limbo, much to the locals’ dismay. Madan Thakur, a resident of Chandrapur, said the locals have been demanding the Chandrapur branch of the Nepal Electricity Authority to install electric wires on the poles, but have received no response so far. “We have been frequenting the office for the last month demanding electricity supply. But the chief at the branch office sends us away citing budget shortage,” Thakur said. Locals have also lodged a complaint at the hotline of the Nepal Electricity Authority against the chief of the branch. But Ramaayodhya Yadav, chief at the branch office, said that his office doesn’t have sufficient budget to complete the installation process. “The wires lie unused at the substation in Chandranighapur. We don’t have enough budget to start installing wires on the poles,” said Yadav, adding that he has notified the higher authority about the problem. According to him, the branch office will fix wires on the poles after the centre provides them with a budget. Dev Prasad Timalsina, a Nepali Congress lawmaker, said that he had talked with Kulman Ghising, the managing director of Nepal Electricity Authority, about the problem. Timalsina, along with the locals, recently visited the branch office to put forth their demands. “The chief of the branch office has given us a positive response,” he said. According to the Energy Progress Report, electricity had reached 95.5 percent of Nepal’s population as of 2017. The report showed that only 1.3 million out of 29 million Nepalis remain to be connected to electricity. Most of these individuals are from remote locations. In 2010, only 65 percent of the country’s population had an electricity connection. As per the Nepal Electricity Authority’s statistics, only eight districts—Bajura, Humla, Jumla, Kalikot, Mugu, Dolpa, Rukum (East) and Solukhumbu—remain to be connected to the national grid.","Published at : January 9, 2020",Rautahat,Shiva Puri
Siraha hospital denies postpartum mothers safe motherhood incentives,"Under the Safe Motherhood Programme, new mothers and babies are eligible for free medical treatment costs, transportation allowance and cash incentives for antenatal and postnatal checkups. But the Ram Kumar Uma Prasad Memorial Hospital, in Siraha, despite running the Safe Motherhood Programme as part of a bid to ensure safe births, has failed to provide incentives and free medications to new mothers visiting the hospital. According to the hospital administration, the hospital has not received the budget for the Safe Motherhood Programme in the current fiscal year.Punamdevi Yadav, a local of Sakhuwanankarkatti, who gave birth to her son in the hospital on December 19, said her attendant had to purchase medicines, which they should have received free of cost from a nearby drug store. “My attendant had to buy an anti-D injection (one ampoule) from a drug store paying Rs 600. Although the hospital had announced free delivery services under the Safe Motherhood Programme, we have been compelled to purchase medicines from outside the hospital.”Taking advantage of the lack of free medicines in the hospital, pharmaceuticals outside the hospital are charging anywhere between Rs 500 to Rs 4,000 for one anti-D injection. “I came here because of the promised services but instead of receiving free delivery services, travel and transportation allowances we had to purchase medicines from a drug store,” said Manju Kumari Sah of Lahan Municipality, who also delivered her baby in the hospital on December 25.According to the hospital, the then-District Public Health Office used to send anti-D injection to the hospital until a year ago. Budur Bhagat, a medical recorder officer of the hospital, said the hospital has not received injection this year. “We have advised new mothers and their attendants to keep the bills of the medicines safely. If the office releases budget, we will reimburse their expenses,” said Bhagat.According to the data of the hospital, 1,654 women have given birth in the hospital in the first five months of the current fiscal year and none of them received the free services nor the allowances from the hospital. The government provides allowances to pregnant women who undergo safe delivery in health institutions. Women in the mountainous, hilly and the Tarai regions are entitled to Rs3,000, Rs2,000 and Rs1,000 respectively. Additionally, a cash bonus of Rs800 should be provided to mothers who complete all four antenatal checkups.The hospital administration has assured new mothers that they will be reimbursing their medical bills and giving them their due allowances once they receive the budget. Dr Sunil Kushwaha, medical superintendent at the hospital, said that the provincial government has not sent necessary budget for the Safe Motherhood Programme yet. “The process has been delayed, as the central level has yet to send budget to the Ministry of Social Development of the province,” said Kushwaha, adding that the ministry directly sends budget to the hospital after the removal of the District Public Health Office since the adoption of federalism.","Published at : January 8, 2020",Siraha,Bharat Jarghamagar
Students in a Sarlahi school forced to sit on cold floors as mercury dip grips Tarai,"A sharp dip in the temperature has severely affected daily life in the Madhes. The effect is most pointed towards those who have little infrastructure to battle the cold. The cold has also affected students, many of whom say they don’t want to go to school because they have to sit down on a cold floor to study.Saroj Yadav, a second grader at the Janata Basic School, said he doesn’t want to go to school because he has to sit down on the cold floor, as there are no desks or benches in his classroom. “But I have to go to the school because my parents pressure me to,” Yadav says.A total of 120 students in the basic school have had to study sitting on the cold floor. The school lacks enough infrastructure and the furniture meant for second and third graders in the school is used by secondary-level students (the basic school upgraded to secondary level starting this year.) As a result, the number of students attending school has been on the decline. Those who attend the school told the Post they are here only because their parents have forced them to. “We have no problem sitting on the floor during the summer, but during the winter it gets tough,” said Yadav, the second grader. “We have repeatedly informed the teachers, requesting them to bring in benches, but we haven’t gotten them yet. Many of my friends have stopped coming to school altogether. I don’t want to come either.”Sangita Kumari, who studies in grade three, said that she and her classmates are making do with the jute sacs and mattresses they bring from their homes to sit on. “But many of my friends don’t wear warm clothes and don’t bring mattresses either, so it must be very hard for them,” she said. According to the school's record, of the total 120 students in two grades, only sixty regularly come to school these days.Meanwhile, some guardians have said they are keeping their children from attending school. “For us the health of our children is more important than their studies,” said Rajib Sah, a local guardian, adding that the school administration has paid no heed to solve the problem.“My child studies in grade two, and once he fell sick because of the cold, and we had to spend over Rs1,000,” Sah said. “So I have decided not to send him to school until the school manages the furniture.”Rambabu Yadav, principal of the school, said that the school has been struggling financially to manage the furniture. Despite the fact that the school is near the Rural Municipality office, the school hasn’t attracted the concern of local representatives. In many ways, Janata is emblematic of the condition of community schools across the country. It not just lacks proper infrastructure but also manpower. For a secondary school that has over 500 students, there are only nine teachers. Principal Yadav lamented the local unit’s indifference in solving the crisis the school is reeling under. “When the school added more classes, the rural municipality said it would provide us budget for the salary of two teachers, but it hasn’t yet,” he said. “Everybody, including the chair, deputy chair of the ward and rural municipality, knows the poor condition of the school but nobody has extended any help.”But Ramayodhya Yadav, chair of the rural municipality, said that teachers are not willing to come to Basbariya, where the school is located. “I am aware of the school’s condition and I am trying to equip the school with furniture and manpower,” he said. “But teachers don’t want to come here because of the remoteness of the location, and there’s a lack of budgets as well. But we are trying.”","Published at : December 30, 2019",Sarlahi,Om Prakash Thakur

"Police destroy 20,000 marijuana plants in Parsa","On Thursday, police destroyed around 20,000 marijuana plants cultivated at Aathghare in Thori Rural Municipality, Parsa.During the clean-up campaign of illegal marijuana farming on Tuesday and Wednesday, police destroyed around 1,000 marijuana plants in Paterwasugauli and 2,500 marijuana plants in Thori.On a daily basis, police personnel have been deployed to destroy marijuana plantations in the municipality, said Birendra Bahadur Shahi, deputy superintendent of police in District Police Office, Parsa. But no individuals have been arrested on the charge of cultivating marijuana.Until a decade ago, Parsa was renowned for marijuana and opium cultivation. The then Superintendent of Police Rajendraman Shrestha had cracked down on the illegal farming of the plants and thus the contraband plantation came to an end in the area.Processed marijuana costs around Rs 3,000 to Rs 4,000 (per kg) in Nepal and the same amount will be sold up to IRs 13,000 to 15,000 in India. Because of this, there are many middlemen engaged in illegal business to make more money.Illegal farming of marijuana can also be seen in the vicinity of Parsa and Chitwan National Parks, forest areas and some lonely areas in the district. Shahi said, “Acting on a tip off, we have been destroying marijuana farming in many areas. Yet people have been cultivating marijuana inconspicuously.”The demand for marijuana is so high that smugglers come to the locals' doorsteps to purchase the product. Youths also have been purchasing this contraband on a regular basis. According to police personnel involved in the clean-up campaign, the owner of the land plots (where marijuana plants were cultivated) could not be found in most of the areas. Shahi said, “Locals often try to escape the police or remain silent if they are asked about the landowners. Due to this, we have been unable to make any arrests.”The District Police Office has been formulating a phase-wise programme to give continuity to the campaign. According to Shahi, they also intend to organise awareness programmes for the locals. “It takes time to change the mindset of the locals who have been engaged in the business for long. That’s why awareness programmes should be organised,” he said.","Published at : December 28, 2019",Parsa,Shankar Acharya
Over 200 flood-displaced families under flimsy huts in biting cold in Inarwa,"More than 200 flood-displaced families of Inarwa, in Janaknandani, are living under flimsy huts, battling bone-chilling cold every night.Their huts (which were near no-man’s land in the Nepal India border point) were swept away by the floods last monsoon. But till date, none of the authorities have paid heed to reconstruct their homes or to relocate them.“My family of five has been compelled to live under a tent (provided by Red Cross) for the past five months,” shares Devi Sada, 76, of Inarwa. Janaknandini Rural Municipality is located in the far east of Janakpurdham, the district headquarters of Dhanusha. Bhagabdevi Sada, 79, of Inarwa, also shared similar sentiments. “Our hut was swept away by the floods during the monsoon. We lost everything. Now, we have no food to eat and warm clothes to protect ourselves during cold,” she said.Most of the locals in the settlement work as daily wage workers to put food on the table. But because of the increasing cold, some are being unable to go to work these days. Dhamendra Goit, ward chairman of Janaknandani Ward No. 1, said, “They are compelled to stay indoors, as most of them don’t have warm clothes to fight the cold.”To keep themselves warm, the locals make fire from hay and sit beside it all night. “We are unable to sleep during the night. That’s why we sit around a fire and spend the whole night that way,” said Kumari Sada, a 79-year-old local woman.Bharati Karki, deputy chief of the rural municipality, said that the local unit does not have adequate budget to construct settlement for these landless people. She said, “We have demanded the necessary budget from the provincial and federal governments to construct temporary huts for them.”A majority of children, senior citizens and postpartum mothers are facing difficulties due to the onset of winter. Nirudevi Das, 40, said small children and senior citizens have started to fall sick because of the dip in temperature. She said, “Poor people like us find it very difficult to survive winter. We have been greatly affected by the cold temperatures.”The victims bemoaned that they have difficulties even to manage two meals a day. “How can we purchase warm clothes when we can’t afford food?” asked Das. Karki, however, said the rural municipality has been planning to distribute some relief, including warm clothes, to the impoverished people. “We are in the process to purchase warm clothes,” said Karki.In July, around 6,000 people were affected after the floods swept away houses and properties in Dhanusha. According to the data of the District Administration Office, more than 240 families living in Inarwa, Balahagoth, Prakhe Mahuwa, Khajuri Chanha, Patanuka and Balahakathal were displaced by the floods.","Published at : December 27, 2019",(inarwa) Dhanusha,Shahiman Rai
Pappu Construction halts work on under-construction bridge in Tikuliya Ghat again,"Pappu Construction has halted work at an under-construction bridge over Lalbakaiya river at Tikuliya Ghat in Rautahat district, again.The construction company, which is notorious for grabbing a large number of projects but not completing them on time, had been on the news last August after a boat capsized after hitting the pillar of the under-construction bridge, killing five people. The construction work had resumed a few months after the incident but it was moving at a snail’s pace. The works finally came to a halt a few weeks ago.“The company has halted construction works at Tikuliya Ghat again. It has been nearly two years that the project contract came to an end, but the contractor has not carried out the work effectively,” said Madan Mohan Singh, an engineer at the Division Road Office in Chandranigahapur. The reason behind the halt: Pappu Construction is demanding payments be made; it has even submitted bills at the Division Road Office. “The contractor has been asking for the payment of a job that it has left incomplete for years,” said Singh.The construction company was awarded the contract in July 2014 with a completion deadline of July 2017. Former proprietor of Pappu Construction Hari Narayan Rauniyar had signed the contract agreement with the DivisionRoad Office in Hetauda to construct the 225 metre-long bridge at the cost of Rs 149.3 million.The under-construction bridge in Tikuliya Ghat connects dozen of villages—including Banjaraha, Baraiya, Mathiya, Jokaha, Bairiya, Akolawa, Rampur—to Gaur, the district headquarters of Rautahat. For now, thousands of people in the area are compelled to cross the river with a wooden bridge, which is dangerous, especially during the monsoons when the volume of the river rises.Locals in the area are becoming increasingly frustrated with the dillydallying of the construction company. “People have lost their lives because of the carelessness of the construction company. Yet, they are not serious,” said Bhuwaneshwor Shahi, the ward chairman of Gaur Municipality-4. “Winter is a suitable time to complete work on the site, but the contractor has stopped work. The contractor should be responsible for the project delay and the consequences it causes.” The Department of Roads has not extended the contract agreement, stating that the bridge construction in Tikuliya Ghat has been delayed due to the negligence of the construction company.","Published at : December 26, 2019",Rautahat,Shiva Puri
Negligence of private pathology labs in Janakpur puts human health at risk,"Well Care Diagnostic Pathology Lab operates in front of the Janakpur Provincial Hospital in Janakpur Hospital Road. The lab, which is not registered with the local unit, is currently running with only one lab assistant.But it is not only Well Care Lab that is operating without registration and with inadequate manpower. There are dozens of other labs operating similarly in the hospital area. And this lack of monitoring illegal pathology labs is putting increasing risk on human health, say locals.Mundrika Singh, the health coordinator of Janakpur Sub Metropolis, said some of the labs (which were registered in the past) have not renewed their licence. The Janakpur Sub Metropolis does not have a record of the total number of pathology labs as well. Pradip Kandel, chief district officer of Dhanusha, said that local unit is responsible to conduct monitoring of labs in accordance to the Consumer Protection Act 2018. He said, “If the local unit does not monitor the labs, then the local administration must shoulder the responsibility.” According to Kandel, the District Administration Office has not received complaints of pathology labs till date.Krishna Adhikari, a local of Janakpur, said some of the doctors of the provincial hospital are even found referring patients to private pathology laboratories for commission.Meanwhile, Dr Nagendra Prasad Yadav, medical superintendent of the provincial hospital, said they have been facing another problem: different labs have been providing different reports for the same specimens. This is creating problems in providing patients effective treatment. “We have had different reports of a single specimen from various labs. How can we treat patients effectively with such reports?” said Yadav.According to him, although the hospital has a lab, they have been compelled to run it with the help of medical students due to a lack of technical staff. Yadav said, “Sometimes we also call lab technicians from outside.” But even the lab reports prepared by the hospital lab are found to be faulty. A few days ago, the hospital lab prepared two different lab reports of the same urine sample of Sanyaja Sah in Janakpur. This highlights the pitiable condition of the lab of the hospital. On the other hand, lab operators are also charging fees higher than the stated amount, as they say they have to provide a commission to the agent and doctors of the provincial hospital. Santosh Sah, an operator of Hi-tech Lab in Janakpur, told the Post, “Most of the drug stores have been developed as pathology labs here. That’s why we have to struggle to find patients.”Even though the doctors of the hospital are found pocketing certain amount of commission from the private laboratories for referring patients, the hospital administration seems to be either unaware of the situation or are blatantly ignoring it. Yadav said, “I am not in a condition to take action against the doctors and other staff of the hospital. If I do so, they will resort to a protest and health services will come to a halt.”","Published at : December 22, 2019",Dhanusha,Santosh Singh
A Musahar settlement in Rautahat lacks land to build toilets,"The 100-odd households of Musahar community at the ninth ward of Chandrapur Municipality in Rautahat do not have toilets at their homes. The dearth of lavatories in the settlement means its residents take their business outdoors. A local government-run open defecation free programme in the settlement has failed to take off due to the lack of land to construct toilet facilities. Although the municipal office had distributed toilet pans and concrete rings in the settlement five months ago, they lie unused. The municipal officials and local representatives have repeatedly asked the households to build toilets, but to no avail. “Where would we build toilets when we don’t even have enough living space?” said Siyaram Musahar, a local man. “There is no point in pressuring us to build toilets. We need land.” The settlement is built on a public land. Most of the huts are crammed tightly, with little to no space in between. The people in the settlement, most of whom eke out their living as daily wage workers, complained that they neither have land nor money to build toilets.They said the local government should find another solution. Gobinda Dulal, chairman of Chandrapur Ward No. 9, admitted that the open defecation free programme failed due to the lack of land plots to build toilets on. “We provided the necessary materials to construct toilets in the settlement. But the programme beneficiaries are telling us that they don’t have space for toilets,” said Dulal.For now, Dulal sees no solution to the problem.Open defecation is still commonplace in Rautahat, even though the district was declared open defecation free in December 2018.Toilet facilities are non-existent or limited in many places, including Dumariya, Badaharwa, Dhamaura, Laximpur and Cetnagar. According to that data at the district’s sanitation office, 2,576 households in Rautahat still do not have toilets.","Published at : December 21, 2019",Rautahat,Shiva Puri
Birgunj High Court seeks suggestions from lawyers to transfer Aftab Alam’s case away from his hometown,"The Birgunj bench of Janakpur High Court has called amicus curiae of lawyers to decide on the demand of government attorney to transfer the murder case against Nepali Congress leader Mohammad Aftab Alam to Parsa District Court from Rautahat, his home district.Sri Narayan Singh Rajput, whose son Trilok Pratap was also killed in a bomb blast and subsequently thrown into a brick kiln under Alam’s direction in 2008, had appealed to the court demanding the transfer of the case. Rajput had moved to the Birgunj High Court after eyewitnesses of the murder were abducted by Alam’s supporters and forced to filed false court testimony to protect him. Alam, who is a member of the House of Representatives, also threatened violence against the police officials who arrested him following the direction from Supreme Court.Deepak Dhakal, the district judge of Rautahat who gave a verdict to send him to prison, and Khadindraraj Katwal, the district attorney who had filed a charge sheet against Alam demanding life imprisonment, had to leave the district on November 15 following threats and pressure while dealing with the case.Rajput in his appeal has claimed Alam could influence the hearing process in his home district, and therefore, it is necessary to shift it to Parsa District Court for a fair trial. Responding to the case, a single bench of Chief Judge Dilli Raj Acharya called the amicus curiae from the High Court Bar Association in Birgunj for its suggestion. There is a practice of seeking suggestions from the bar, which is not associated with the cases, in vital cases in the judiciary. “A further hearing will be held on January 2, 2020, in a division bench,” reads the ruling issued by the court on Wednesday.","Published at : December 19, 2019",Kathmandu,Binod Ghimire
Impoverished families in Sarlahi depend on hay to combat the cold,"For 45-year-old Sevatiya Malli, letting a cluster of hay to dry in the sun has become her routine these days. With the winter deepening, Malli’s family has been using hay for bedding to insulate the sleeping area in their home. But after a night’s use, the hay gets damp and has to be dried in the sun before it is re-used.Many marginalised Musahar families like Malli’s are not financially secure to be able to prepare for the winter so they make blankets out of the most easily available resource—hay. “To beat this year’s cold we have devised a trick, to store the hay in jute sacs and use it for blankets and bedding.”Every year, the winter, and the westerly wind and cold wave that it brings, adversely affects the most impoverished settlements in Sarlahi, like the Musahar and Dom communities. As in previous years, the most worrying aspect of winter for these people is the lack of warm clothes and shelter. So like last winter, this year too they are relying on hay beds to stave off the cold off, as their bamboo-fenced houses do not do much to keep the howling cold wind out, according to Malli. “While we somehow see through December-January first week, the cold wave and westerly wind will get harder when January comes to a close,” said Malli, whose family lives in a small hut made in a public space by the Lakhandehi River. “The cold has increased surprisingly in the past couple of days. Our only remedy for the cold is hay.” Last year a few organisations had distributed blankets but for a lack of space to keep them, they have been damaged by mice, Pushani Devi Majhi, another local, said. “We can’t buy proper clothing and don’t have a house that resists cold,” she said. “For the time being, we need to make the best use of hay.”","Published at : December 19, 2019",Sarlahi,Om Prakash Thakur
"Senior citizens, single women and people with disabilities deprived of social security allowance in Siraha","More than 1,200 senior citizens, disabled and single women in Bhagawanpur Rural Municipality in Siraha district have been deprived of the social security allowance owing to the sheer negligence of the local unit.The elderly people, disabled and single women of the entire local unit have not received the monthly allowance for eight months of the last fiscal year of 2018/19. The budget was frozen because the rural municipality failed to distribute the amount to the beneficiaries on time.“The rural municipality has not given us our allowance for eight months of the last fiscal year. The local unit has to give us allowance for 12 months in total by the end of Kartik (mid-November). We have received an allowance of only four months,” said Siltu Yadav, 76, of Naraha.Demanding that they be provided with the allowance of the missed eight months immediately, senior citizens, single women and the disabled have been staging a sit-in in front of the rural municipality office in Bhagawanpur.On Wednesday, around 300 senior citizens and single women attended the protest programme. They also submitted a week-long ultimatum at the office of the rural municipality. They warned of padlocking the office of the local unit if their demand was not addressed.The government, through the annual budget, increased the elderly allowance to Rs 3,000 per month from the current fiscal year. Earlier, senior citizens, those above 70 years of age, were entitled to Rs 2,000 as monthly social security allowance.Dhyani Paswan, 73, of Thadi was at the protest venue. He said he was compelled to join the protest because it has become difficult for him to meet his expenses without the allowance. “We are poor. My wife and I live with our grandson. We somehow eke out a living with the allowance. But since the employees held back our eight months of allowance, we are in a rut,” said Paswan.Sujit Kumar Yadav, chief administrative officer of the local body, said the budget allocated under the social security allowance was frozen as it was not distributed within the last fiscal year. “The rural municipality could not distribute the allowance due to a shortage of employees. The delay in holding the village council was also one of the reasons for our inability to distribute the budget,” he claimed. According to him, the rural municipality has requested higher authorities to allocate the necessary budget for the same.","Published at : December 19, 2019",Siraha,Bharat Jarghamagar

A crisis centre provides relief to victims of violence in Janakpur,"The Province 2 government in 2010 had decided to set up a one-stop crisis centre in every hospital to provide health examination, counselling and treatment to victims of gender violence. However, the centre was established at the Provincial Hospital in Janakpur only around seven months ago, on May 21. The programme has yet to be implemented in several districts.Despite the delay in its establishment, the centre has been a success, said KD Das, one of the doctors who work at the centre. “We duly examine the health of gender violence victims and prepare reports based on it. The victims visit the centre voluntarily with the help of police and various social organisations,” said Das. According to him, the centre complies with the guidelines for the crisis centre, which range from protecting the victims’ information to providing them with medical treatment and preparing fair health report for investigation. Das claimed that victims of gender violence have been encouraged to share their ordeals and get treatment with the establishment of the one-stop crisis management centre.According to data available at the centre, 329 gender violence victims, including a man, have received services from the centre since its establishment in May. The centre administration said 32 victims had been referred to other hospitals for further treatment. As many as 23 victims of sexual assault were brought to the centre from mid-November to mid-December, the data shows. Shiva Paswan, a relative of a gender violence victim from Dhanusha district, told the Post that the victim received quick and effective services from the centre.The centre provides free treatment to the victims, sends them to safe houses if needed, and also gives them travel expenses. However, the programme remains to be implemented in several districts of the province. “The government’s decision could not be implemented due to a lack of budget, shortage of manpower and other resources, and lack of training,” said Dr Pramod Kumar Yadav, the outgoing director of the provincial health directorate.The provincial government has allocated Rs 2 million to the centre in Janakpur in the current fiscal year.","Published at : December 18, 2019",Janakpur,Shahiman Rai
Preparation for Visit Nepal 2020 in Parsa “absolutely zero”,"With Visit Nepal 2020 just around the corner, locals and entrepreneurs of Parsa district have lamented the authorities’ poor preparation for the signature tourism year.Hari Panta, chair of the Parsa Hotel and Tourism Entrepreneurs’ Association, said that the preparation so far for the upcoming tourism year is ‘absolutely zero’. “Just because a quartet of people get together and post a couple of selfies on social media platforms doesn’t mean preparations are on,” he said. “A couple of seminars may have been organised in star hotels in the name of Visit Nepal 2020, but that will not do much to promote tourism in the district.” The Visit Nepal 2020 campaign targets to bring 2 million foreign tourists to Nepal but the preparations, or lack thereof, have been received with widespread criticisms.Panta said that the government could have utilised the amount spent in seminars to actually identify and promote the major tourist destinations in the district.The Birgunj Metropolis had founded a committee to promote the city for the tourism year following pressure from the federal government. Noting that he once used to be a part of the committee, Panta said that not a single meeting has taken place since its formation. Panta and three other members of the committee have already resigned from their positions.Panta added that the tourism year won’t be a success with the effort of hotel entrepreneurs only. “Our only responsibility is to provide good service to the visiting tourists,” he said. “The onus is on the state to promote the destinations and create a good environment so that more tourists would come.”In view of the upcoming campaign, a local drive Visit Madhes was also conceived a while back. Om Prakash Sarraf, the coordinator of the programme, said that the district is home to many tourist hubs, but they remain in the shadows. “If we can promote the great features of Parsa National Park, we can draw a significant footfall,” he said. Citing other major hubs such as Thhori homestay, Parasnath Math and Koilabhar, Sarraf said that the places hold plenty of prospects, but they are yet to be explored as a tourist attraction. “We have started identifying and promoting the destinations in whatever ways we can, but there needs to be a larger initiative as well,” said Sarraf.Birgunj Mayor Bijay Kumar Sarawagi said the metropolis office is ‘very positive’ in promoting the district for the Visit Nepal Year 2020. Sarawagi said that the metropolis office has allocated Rs 1 million for various programmes to promote tourism. “There will be various kinds of programmes year-round for the Visit Nepal Year 2020,” he said.","Published at : December 16, 2019",Parsa,Shankar Acharya
Rail operation uncertain on Janakpur-Jayanagar broad-gauge line,"Rail operation along the Janakpur-Jayanagar broad-gauge line has yet to start even as the track and other infrastructure were built around two years ago.Local people have started expressing their ire as the authorities have failed to resume the service despite repeated assurances. Then minister for physical infrastructure and transport Raghubir Mahaseth had publicly committed to relaunching the railway service by 2018.“It is still not clear when the service will begin. People question the delays though the infrastructure has already been prepared,” said Sunil Mishra, a resident of Janakpur.According to the Department of Railways, the procurement process for two rail engines and compartments started long ago. Balaram Mishra, director general of the department, said a contract was signed with Konkan Railways Corporation Limited of India. “It’s time for the delivery of the rail engine. The service will be started by mid-March 2020,” Mishra claimed.In May, the Railway Department signed the agreement with the Indian company to supply two diesel-electric multiple unit train sets for passenger service from Kurtha of Janakpur to Jaynagar of India.The 69 km Jayanagar-Janakpur-Bardibas railway has been built at a cost of around Rs10 billion, with support from the Indian government. Indian Railway Construction Company Limited built the line in three phases—Jayanagar to Kurtha, Kurtha to Bhangaha and Bhangaha to Bardibas. The stretch in India is 3 kilometres long. Construction started in 2010, with the target of operating rail service by the end of 2018.Monsoon floods this year swept away 71 metres of the railroad near Inarwa station along Khajuri-Jayanagar section. “Maintenance of the damaged line is in the final stage. It will be completed soon,” said Binod Ojha, an engineer at the Department of Railways.Preparations are going on to commence the rail service along the 35-km Jayanagar-Janakpur stretch in the first phase. Mishara estimates that it will take two to three years to operate the service up to Bardibas of Mahottari district.The Janakpur-Jayanagar track was built nearly 85 years ago during the British colonial rule in India with an objective of transporting timber from the forests of Mahottari to India. The old line spanned 52 km from Bijulpura in Mahottari, Nepal, to Jaynagar in Bihar, India.Railway law yet to be formulatedThough the railway infrastructure is ready for operation, the law to govern the service is not in place. Staff recruitment process has yet to begin. “The railway law has already been approved by the Cabinet. The upcoming winter session of Parliament will endorse the law,” said Mishra, adding that the hiring process would begin soon after the law is enacted. An estimated 200 employees are required for operating the Jayanagar-Janakpur rail service.","Published at : December 14, 2019",Janakpur,Shyam Sundar Shashi
Police inspector among three killed in Dhanusha blast,"Three persons, including a police inspector, were killed in a powerful explosion in Dhanusha, on Friday midnight. Four others sustained injuries in the blast at a house belonging to Rajesh Sah’s in Kshireshwarnath Municipality-5.According to the District Police Office in Dhanusha, Rajesh Sah (46) and his son Ananda Sah (24) died on the spot, while Police Inspector Amir Kumar Dahal succumbed to his injuries in BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences, Dharan. Rajesh’s another son Prakas Sah (14), daughter Anjali Sah (19), father Bhikhari Sah (73) and police constable Rijhnath Mahato were injured in the explosion. They are receiving treatment in Dharan, police said.Rajesh had informed the Area Police Office in Mahendranagar immediately after he saw the suspicious object hanging by the door. He went to the police office using another door and reported about the object. The explosive went off when Rajesh and the security personnel reached home.According to the locals who witnessed the incident, the bomb went off without anyone touching it. Investigation officers suspected that it could be a time bomb. The house was badly damaged in the blast, leaving its main door ripped apart, the wall collapsed and window panes smashed.The incident site is around 100 metres east of Mahendranagar Chowk along the Janakpur-Dhalkebar road section. “Postmortems were performed on the bodies at the Dharan-based BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences,” said Inspector Avadesh Kumar Yadav, at Dhanusa District Police Office.Meanwhile, police arrested three persons in connection with the blast. According to Deputy Superintendent of Police Rameshwor Karki, Lalita Devi Mahara and Sita Devi Mahara of Hansapur-2 and Ramsobhit Dahal of Mithila Bihari-1 were detained for investigation. It is suspected that the accused trio are members of the Netra Bikram Chand-led Communist Party of Nepal.The District Police Office formed a seven-member investigation team led by Police Inspector Uma Shankar Sah. “Investigation is underway,” said Karki. Rajesh was the owner of a pharmacy and a dairy in Mahendranagar Bazaar. It is not immediately known about the motive behind the blast, police said.

Bardibas’ pride project fails to take off,"The farmland of the ‘Model Agro Village’, initiated by Bardibas Municipality as its pride project, is a far cry from success, with fields drying up for lack of irrigation facilities.The local farmers blame the municipal authority for ignoring a problem that is making their life worse. To have launched the programme without proper management and preparation and to have asked the locals to be a part of the programme was a mistake on the authorities part, say locals.“We planted vegetables in the model agro village expecting a good harvest. But the plants are gradually drying up and the municipality does not pay any heed to our problem,” said Ganga Devi Mahato, a local farmer. She blamed the people’s representatives and employees of ignoring the farmers’ grievances despite repeated requests.The municipality launched the Mayor Agriculture Programme to turn 75 bighas of land into a ‘Model Agro Village’ at Ward No. 2 and 6 of the municipality as pride projects. The programme aims to teach around 46,000 farmers modern farming methods in order to transform subsistence agriculture into a commercial one. The first phase of the programme took off earlier this fiscal year. Various vegetables like cauliflowers, cabbages, tomatoes, brinjals, chillies, spinach and coriander have been planted in around 10 katthas of land under the programme. According to the municipality, it has spent Rs 1.5 million on the project so far.Kabiraj Uprety, chief executive officer, said that the municipality had released Rs 50 million budget last fiscal year and allocated Rs 90 million in the current fiscal year.According to him, the municipality plans to set up cold stores, ponds for fishery, agriculture tools centre and soil test centre in the ‘Model Agro Village’. He, however, admits that the municipality did not do its homework and preparation before launching the project, which is why the project is struggling to take off. Ganga Ram Mahato, one of the municipality employees, working with the ‘Model Agro Village’ project, said that the project is facing roadblocks because a deep boring well that was installed for irrigation purposes ran dry.“The vegetables started drying up as the installed motor could not lift the underground water,” he said. “We have not thought about an alternative yet. The other water source is around 300 metres from the farmland,” he added. The local farmers express dissatisfaction of the municipality’s lack of vision and execution plan for something it calls its “priority project”. “The vegetables planted under the model agro village programme dried and decayed in the farmland. That says a lot about this project,” said Santosh Kumar Singh, a local farmer.Mayor Bidur Karki, however, pledged his commitment to make the ‘Model Agro Village’ campaign a success. “We will gradually solve the problems. All the farmers within the municipality will be able to reap benefits from the programme within three years,” said Karki.","Published at : December 13, 2019",Mahottari,Sunita Baral
"Statues are being stolen from Simraungadh, but nobody is bothered","A month ago, locals extracted an ancient statue of Lord Bishnu from a pond at Nayaka Tole in Simraungadh Municipality, Bara. The pond was being dug up by an excavator, and the statue broke before it could be taken out. The broken statue was left unattended for days on the pond’s bank, after which it got stolen. As the news broke out, the police began to investigate. They reached Barthahawa in Sarlahi and discovered that the statue was stolen by Nabim Ram, the driver of the excavator used to dig the pond. In his statement to the police, Ram said that he decided to take the statue since nobody cared about it for a month.“It took quite an effort to arrest the thief and get hold of the statue,” said SP Apurva Dhungana. “Locals are now talking about conserving the statue.”This is not a singular incident. Prior to this, other statues of Rajdevi, Krishna and Bishnu were stolen from the same municipality, including a big bell from Kankali Temple. Nobody knows where these artefacts are today.Ajaya Chandra Singh, a local, said that some of the statues that were previously discovered have been kept at the police station for lack of a museum. “But why are the statues not being preserved?” said Singh. “Statues of historical significance keep on appearing, but nobody seems to care about preserving them.”Simraungadh is the capital city of the Mithila kingdom and houses many historical palaces, which is why statues and other artefacts are frequently extracted from various places in the municipality. But there has been a marked indifference from all quarters about preserving these historical objects.Even though the municipality floated a plan and allocated budgets to conserve the statues last year, the plan is yet to materialise. Mayor Bijaya Shankar Yadav said that the municipality is ready to coordinate with police to conserve these historical artefacts. “Besides the local unit, the police administration and the Department of Archaeology should also pay attention to conserving the statues.”Chudamani Ghimire, chair of Guthi Sansthan Birgunj, said the Department of Archaeology should be active in conserving the artefacts.The department has kept a few statues at a house near Kanakli Temple, but due to lack of care, the statues are now coated in dust.An Italian conservation organisation and the Department of Archaeology in the early 90s had extracted statues from the historic fort of Simraungadh.

But all these years later, not much has been done.Locals say the conservation hasn’t started despite their repeated requests to the local units.“Simraungadh carries a huge tourism potential,” said Jayant Kuswaha, chief of Simraungadh Chamber of Commerce. “Political leaders make promises to turn Simraungadh into a tourism hub, but they have been nothing more than a token to win the election.”","Published at : December 10, 2019",Bara,Laxmi Sah
A school that shuts down when someone in the settlement dies,"A community school at Prashurampur in Kalikamai Rural Municipality, Parsa, gets closed when someone in the settlement dies. It is shut down not to observe mourning but due to fear.Teaching/learning activities in Nepal Rastriya Basic School get halted when bereaved families and villagers perform funeral rites in the village crematorium, which lies right next to the school.“The school children get scared and flee to their homes when funeral rites are observed in the crematorium. The school remains unofficially closed when someone dies in the settlement,” said Indradev Prasad Kurmi, the school headmaster. A total of 597 students are enrolled at the school in the current academic year. The children, according to Kurmi, are distressed upon seeing dead bodies being burnt near the school.“We are scared when bodies are burnt. Smokes from the pyre engulf the school, and we have difficulty breathing,” said Sandip Kushwaha, a student of grade eight. “We are unable to go to school for a few days due to fear.” There are around 600 families in the area who use the crematorium ground near the school building. The school headmaster said at least a dozen people are cremated there in a year.“We have been facing this problem for a long time. The school administration has repeatedly urged the ward office and the rural municipal office to address the issue but to no avail,” said Kurmi.Kurmi admitted that there had been efforts to shift the crematorium to a different location. But some locals stand against the decision, stating that it is against the age-old tradition, he added.Nathuni Kushwaha, the rural municipality chairman, said he would address the problem soon. “I have been informed about the issue at hand. I am coordinating with the ward chief for a possible solution. The issue will be resolved soon,” Kushwaha said.","Published at : December 9, 2019",Parsa,Shankar Acharya
Supreme Court asks government to halt plans for Nijgadh airport,"The Supreme Court on Friday asked the government to put a hold on the construction of the Nijgadh International Airport.The decision comes amid widespread criticism of the plan to construct the airport, one of the government’s pride projects, by environmentalists who say the felling of millions of trees would lead to environmental degradation, resulting in loss of habitats for different wildlife species.Responding to a writ petition filed by nine individuals, including Ranju Hajur Pande, an environmentalist, and former secretary Dwarika Nath Dhungel, a single bench of Justice Tanka Bahadur Moktan issued the stay order Friday afternoon.The petitioners have named Prime Minister’s Office, the Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Civil Aviation, the Ministry of Forest and Environment as well as Office of the Chief Minister and Ministry of Industry, Culture, Forest and Environment of Province 2 as defendants.The Supreme Court has called both the parties for discussion on December 15 on the issue. In their writ, the petitioners have said 90 percent of the airport’s area falls within the dense forest and the Environment Impact Assessment report has stated that as many as 2.4 million trees need to be axed for the project.Vijay Kumar Singh Danuwar, a forester and one of the petitioners, said they were not against the airport construction. “We are only trying to save the precious forest cover and want the government to change the location a little down south.”“If the construction site is taken a few kilometres down, the jungle will be safe,” said Danuwar. “Province 2 has the least forest cover compared to other provinces. So the provincial government has also been protesting against the possible environmental degradation.”The proposed International Airport site is adjacent to Parsa National Park and is home to endangered wildlife and an important biodiversity corridor at the foothills of the Chure range. Conservationists fear that the construction of the airport will destroy the natural biodiversity corridor used by the wildlife of the national park, especially those used by wild elephants.The airport project was initially conceptualised in 1994. It got traction after the late Rabindra Adhikari, during his tenure as the tourism minister, started a strong lobby for taking the project forward. Adhikari and proponents of the airport claimed that Nijgadh Airport could be a game-changer for Nepal as it could serve as a hub for South Asia.After Adhikari’s death in a helicopter crash, Yogesh Bhattarai became the tourism minister in July-end. Bhattarai has been making a strong pitch for the airport, at times giving the impression that the Nijgadh airport is his sole agenda. Bhattarai has even said on multiple occasions that the government would construct the airport at any cost in the same location—whatever the consequences. Bhattarai had even announced to lay the foundation stone of the project by the end of this month. The government on September 23 had shortlisted contractors for the construction of the mega project. A meeting of the Investment Board of Nepal, chaired by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, had shortlisted Zurich Airport International AG of Switzerland as a single company to work under the public-private partnership model for the construction of the country’s fourth international airport.The board had received letters of intent from eight companies from seven countries, including Nepal, for the construction of the $3.45 billion airport project in Bara. The airport, about 175km from the Capital, is expected to serve as an alternative to congestion and winter fog at Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan International Airport, the country’s sole aerial gateway.In a recent interview with the Post, Rajan Pokhrel, director-general of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, said that Investment Board Nepal is currently negotiating the investment modality for the airport. According to Pokhrel, the prime minister has taken initiative to build the project and that the government will soon grant orders to clear trees on the site.","Published at : December 6, 2019",Kathmandu,Tika R Pradhan
"Lack of physical infrastructure, human resources in community schools of Parsa","Bandevi Basic School in Bhatuda, Paterwasugauli Rural Municipality, runs classes up to grade five but has only four classrooms. The school runs classes for grade two and three in the same room.There are 150 students in the school but only five teachers. Subash Prasad Das, the school’s headmaster, said the school administration is facing difficulties to run classes due to a lack of proper infrastructure and insufficient teachers. There are 23 schools in the rural municipality plagued with similar problems. Mamata Tharu, the vice-chairperson of the rural municipality, said, “There are schools in almost every settlement, but most of them lack infrastructure. The government went on a spree of opening schools, but there are no proper provisions to run and maintain them.”Officials at the rural municipal office said there’s a lack of teachers and infrastructure in almost all schools in the municipality. Education experts say schools with a low number of students have to be merged to ensure quality education. Brija Kishor Sah, an officer at the District Education Development and Coordination Unit in Parsa, said almost all schools in Parsa are lacking in terms of infrastructure and education quality.“There’s no need for 23 schools in Paterwasugauli. The rural municipal office has to merge schools and fulfil the necessary quotas of government teachers to strengthen the education system,” Sah said. According to the latest data of the Education Development Directorate, 724 community schools have been merged across the country. The practice of merging schools is intended to enhance the quality of education by centralising scattered resources. Paterwasugauli Rural Municipality, to ensure quality education, also plans to merge its community schools. “Most of the community schools in Paterwasugauli have fewer students and lack the necessary physical infrastructure. Because of this, they are on the verge of closure,” said Tharu. “The only measure that can ensure the survival of the schools is to merge them.”The government had introduced the School Merging Implementation Directives 2014 to address the decreasing number of students in public schools. According to the directives, schools located within 30 minutes of walking distance and serve a small population and are unable to meet the minimum criteria of a full-fledged foundation (basic or secondary school) can be merged and run as a full-fledged school.","Published at : December 4, 2019",Paterwasugauli (parsa),Shankar Acharya
Fall Armyworm ruin hundreds of bighas of corn fields across Sarlahi,"Every year after paddy harvest, Ram Bahadur Khatri, a corn farmer in Bagmati, Sarlahi, grows corn in a bigha of land. This year, Khatri expanded his cornfield to 1.5 bighas for he had generated good profit with his corn harvest last year. However, this year he has little hopes of breaking even. His field is riddled with Fall Armyworm, a type of agricultural pest.According to Khatri, his corn plants were healthy enough to grow well. But, within a week, the plants have started to dry up after swarms of the Fall Armyworms took over his crops. “I purchased some pesticides from the market and sprayed it but that did not have any effect. The pests keep growing in number,” said Khatri.A majority of farmers who sow corn after harvesting paddy in the western and northern part of the district are facing similar problems. This harvest season Fall Armyworm has taken over more than a hundred bighas of land in the district, according to local farmers. Bal Kishor Thapa, a resident of Lalbandi, said that pest infestation has already spread to most parts of the district. “I have already sprayed pesticides in corn plants thrice this year but they have failed to work on the pests. The pest is spreading at an alarming rate,” said Thapa. He has cultivated corn plants in two bighas of land this season but is harbouring no hope of a good harvest.According to agriculture experts, Fall Armyworm (which was first found in America) has been spreading through Africa and Asia since 2016, flying up to 100 km (60 miles) a night. Usually, Fall Armyworm become active at night and feed on crops.Farmers in Sarlahi say that this is the first time that they have encountered such a problem on such a large scale. Surendra Mahato, a local farmer, said that he has been preparing his field to sow wheat in the hope of recovering from the losses he made with his corn yield this year. He said, “I spent Rs 40,000 while cultivating corn in two bighas of land this season, and now the pests have taken over my field. I’ll try to grow wheat. Hopefully, I’ll grow enough to cover my losses.” Famers have been commercially cultivating corn in Shankarpur, Rajghat, Janakinagar Pattharkot, Karmaiya, Hajariya, Barhathawa and Murtiya, among other areas. Farmers bemoaned that the Fall Armyworm also affected paddy plants during the harvesting season this year. Ram Chandra Pandit, a local of Basbariya, said that the pests completely destroyed his stalks of paddy. “Last year, we harvested five to six mann (240kg) of paddy in one Kattha of land. But this season we harvested only three mann (120kg) on the same land. Fall armyworm had destroyed 40 percent of our paddy stalks.”Although farmers are making individual efforts to control the spread of Fall Armyworm by using pesticides in their fields, it’s far from sufficient. The first case of Fall Armyworm was reported in Ramechhap in August but lack of state intervention even after five months has led to unstoppable damage. “The government has not taken any initiatives against the menace of the Fall Armyworm.” Pandit said, “The outbreak has threatened the overall corn production from the district this year. The government authorities should immediately start “search and destroy” campaigns in the affected areas to control the pest.”Farmers across the district have been requesting the concerned authority to adopt pest control measures to prevent further destruction of crops. However, the only form of support they have received is from the Agriculture Knowledge Centre in Sarlahi. “We are trying our best to mitigate the damage done by the Fall Armyworm in the district,” said Devananda Raya, chief at the centre. “These insects are most active at night so we have advised the farmers to spray pesticides in the evening for better results,” he said.Although the farmers are taking preventive measures to control these destructive pests, it is a difficult feat, as the pests carry the ability to multiply and spread at a quick pace, he said. “The state must take this issue seriously. We need to find a permanent solution to this growing problem because this is not just about farmers, it will also reflect on the overall crop output of the district,” said Thapa.","Published at : December 3, 2019",Sarlahi,Om Prakash Thakur

Encroachment along Chandranigahpur road section continues unabated,"Chandrapur Municipality has done little to clear illegal vendors from the roadside in Chandranigahpur, four months since the local unit made a decision to evict them. Chandranigahpur is one of the busiest towns along the East-West Highway and is a rest stop for most vehicles passing by.Following widespread criticism, the municipality four months ago made the decision to stop the encroachment of roadside land in Chandranigahpur. The decision was made in chairpersonship of Mayor Ramchandra Chaudhary, representatives from the area police, division road department, district traffic police, and other stakeholders. But four months on, the encroachment continues, and criticism keeps on mounting. The highway and sidewalks are still peppered with food and vegetable stalls. Deputy Mayor Ramrati Chaudhary said the municipality is committed to enforcing the decision to clear the roadside properties. “An upcoming municipal meeting will make a concrete decision towards solving the problem,” she said. “There are other problems as well, such as parking. We are trying to solve them all at once.”Prior to this, the area police, district police and traffic had banned vendors from setting up stalls along the highway six years ago. There have been repeated attempts since then, but the vendors haven’t budged. The encroachment goes into overdrive during festivals. Chief Inspector of District Traffic Shailesh Neupane said unchecked stalls and haphazard parking are among the major causes of road accidents in the section. “We can’t do anything unless the municipality takes a concrete step,” he said.The street vendors the Post talked to said that they have no option than put up their shops on the roadside. “We can’t afford to rent space for a shop, and we don’t have a job either,” said Pandit Prasad, a street vendor who sells fruits.In Chandranigahpur, it’s not only the street vendors who have breached the rules. Many buildings have been erected on the highway’s roadsides. Some have built a barn for cattle on the roadsides. According to the Division Road Office’s criteria, there should be a 25 metres of open space on each side of the highway, and 15 metres on auxiliary roads.","Published at : December 1, 2019",Rautahat,Shiva Puri
IED detonated outside ruling party candidate’s office in Mahottari,"An improvised explosive device was detonated at the contact office of Nepal Communist Party candidate Bikram Chaudhary in Mahottari on Thursday evening.According to Superintendent of Police Shyam Krishna Adhikari, a pressure cooker bomb was detonated on the premises of the contact office of NCP candidate Chaudhary, who is vying for the post of Pipara Rural Municipality chief in the upcoming by-elections. “Although there was a loud explosion, the office has only sustained minor damages. There were no human casualties,” Adhikari said. “Investigation is underway into the incident.”The incident took place at a time when police claimed to have tightened security as the silent hour is being observed for the November 30 elections.Meanwhile, security has been stepped up along the Nepal-India border point in view of the elections. However, security agencies are having a hard time managing the security in the region as thousands of devotees from across the border are entering Janakpur through Pipara to observe Bibaha Panchami festival, said police.","Published at : November 28, 2019",Dhanusa,Santosh Singh
E-rickshaw drivers caught smuggling firewood in Chandrapur,"Two years back, the local government decided to replace cycle rickshaws with e-rickshaws in Chandrapur bazaar in Rautahat. The first year saw 50 e-rickshaws in operation, by the next year rolled, the number had more than doubled. Today the bazaar has more than 350 e-rickshaws. The increase in the number of e-rickshaws has left many of these e-rickshaw drivers fighting with each other to find passengers.Seeking an alternative income source, e-rickshaw drivers have found their way into the National Forest area in Chandrapur Municipality Ward No. 3 and No. 6 to collect firewood and sell them in the local market. But the collection and sale of firewood without permission from the Department of Forest is illegal. Binod Singh, chief at the Division Forest Office, said, “Entering the forest area with the motive of collecting firewood without permission is illegal.” Every day, a dozen or so e-rickshaws enter the national forest and leave the area with their vehicles loaded with firewood, said Singh. One of the e-rickshaw drivers, who chose to remain anonymous, said that e-rickshaw drivers earn more money smuggling firewood than driving their vehicles, and that it is a better option than having to wait all day for passengers. “We make around Rs 4,000 while carrying firewood from the forest two to three times a day,” he said. According to him, hotel entrepreneurs and bakery factories pay Rs 2,500 per load of firewood. “We cannot even make even Rs 1,000 while carrying passengers. Some of my friends told me that they make more money selling firewood from the forest and I followed suit,” he said. After the incidents of smuggling of firewood from the forest came to light, the Division Forest Office in Rautahat has started to arrest and detain e-rickshaws from Chandranigahapur-Lamaha section along the East-West Highway. “The e-rickshaw drivers not only collect dry firewood from the forest floor, but also cut down young trees because they are easier to cut down,” said Singh. It was the locals of Chandrapur who brought the involvement of e-rickshaw drivers’ illegal activities to the forest department’s notice, said Singh. Madhu Dhital, a local, said, “Trying to make a living is not an offence, but most of these drivers supply raw wood to the market which means that they are involved in cutting down green trees. If this goes unchecked, then national forests will be lost.” Kedar Timalsina, former chairman of the Nepal Transportation Independent Worker Association E-rickshaw Unit Committee in Chandranigahapur, said that most e-rickshaw drivers have resorted to collecting firewood from the forest for lack of better options. “The demand for e-rickshaws in Chandrapur area is easily fulfilled by 40 to 50 e-rickshaws, but the number of rickshaws in this area is increasing day by day,” said Timalsina.One of the solutions to controlling the smuggling of firewood is to put a cap on the number of e-rickshaws in Chandrapur, say forest officials. To that effect, the Chandrapur Municipality must come up with plans and policies to control the number of e-rickshaws. Ramrati Chaudhary, deputy mayor of Chandrapur Municipality, said that the municipal office has plans to manage three-wheelers in the bazaar area. “We are aware of the growing problem of smuggling of firewood from the national forest area. We will hold discussions with the concerned stakeholders to solve the problem,” she said. “We will set rules and regulations to control the number of vehicles in the area.” For now, the Division Forest Office have taken matters into its own hands. “We have started to impound the vehicles (e-rickshaw, tempo and bicycle) if they are found involved in illegal business. We won’t let anyone enter the forest and smuggle firewood,” said Binod Shrestha. The seized vehicles are kept at Armed Forest Guard’s Office. The forest office is yet to disclose the type of legal punishment to be taken against the guilty.","Published at : November 27, 2019",Rautahat,Shiva Puri
Marketplace mismanagement hits farmers in Janakpur,"The vegetable marketplace at the Janakpur Railway Station is popular for fresh, inexpensive and organic produce delivered directly by the farmers. Lately, however, it has been mired with controversy. Farmers allege that while they struggle to find a place to set up their stalls, retailers establish multiple of them.“Let’s say if we set up a stall in one spot today, tomorrow it will be occupied by someone else,” said a farmer from Katarait village, which lies four km east to the railway station. “Because of this, customers are buying produce at a higher cost, because the retailers charge more money than the farmers.”Sanjay Kumar Gupta, who lives nearby the station, said the allegations made by the farmers are true, adding that the market has been in disarray since the dissolution of the market management committee. “About a dozen retailers have captured the market. They buy the produce from the farmers at low prices and sell at marked up prices,” said Gupta. “When they capture the spots, innocuous farmers are compelled to move their stalls every day.” Some of these vendors have even built permanent stalls, narrowing the marketplace, much to the farmers’ woes, Gupta said.The space where the vegetable market is set up belongs to the Janakpur Railway and has been in operation for the past three decades. Lately, the Mahavir Temple management committee had taken charge of the vegetable market.Last year, the management committee made Rs850,000 in rents. According to an agreement between the railway authority and the management committee, 70 percent of the amount would go to the former while the rest would be used for the cleanliness and maintenance of the space, said Rajendra Sah, chief of the committee.But in May last year, Janakpur Sub-metropolis wrote a letter addressing the management committee, asking it to hand over the space’s administration to the metropolis. “It is after that the market’s operation has gone haywire,” said Sah.Meanwhile, some locals have even gone as far as to allege the sub-metropolis of siding with retailers in ostracising the farmers.“I go to the market every day but the space previously occupied by the farmers is increasingly being encroached by retailers, who sell the produce at a high price,” said Sangeeta Devi, a local of Shivapath in Janakpur. “We are duped every day.”","Published at : November 26, 2019",Janakpur,Shyam Sundar Shashi
"Province 2 tops in government job applications, but response from women remains poor","Province 2 has topped the chart when it comes to applicants for civil service jobs under the vacancy notice called by the Public Service Commission. However, when it comes to women applicants from Province 2, their share in terms of percentage points compared to men is the lowest in terms of total applications received from women compared to other provinces, according to a new report of the commission.According to the commission’s Annual Report for 2018-19, it received 143,840 applications from across the country and of them 41,331 were from Province 2.Data showed the share of the applications from Province 2 alone stood at 29 percent of the total, leaving Province 1 a distant second with 18 percent. However, women applicants from Province 2 stood at 31 percent of the total applications.Although the number of women applicants from Karnali Province and Sudurpashchim Province is also lower compared to men, the male-female gap is not as wide as it is in Province 2. Women applicants outnumbered men in other four provinces—Province 1, Province 3, Gandaki and Provinc3 5. In the case of Province 3, the number of women applicants was more than double that of men.An exactly similar situation prevailed in the fiscal year 2017-18 too when Province 2 topped the chart in terms of applications, accounting for 25 percent of the total applications. When it came to women’s participation, only 33.6 percent of applications in the province were from women. The application trend from other provinces in the fiscal year 2017-18 too shows women outnumbering men in Provinces 1 and 3, Gandaki and Province 5.“Province 2 tops in terms of applications and recruitment in the government service but women’s participation from there is disappointing compared to other provinces,” said Anandaraj Dhakal, secretary at the commission. “It is possibly due to low literacy rate of women in this province compared to other provinces.”The average national literacy rate for women stands at 57.4 percent, according to Population Census 2011. But the Fact-Sheet published by UNWomen, a United Nations body that works for the rights of women, literacy rate in all eight districts of Province 2 is less than 50 percent. For example, illiteracy in Mahottari, Sarlahi and Rauthat is more than 60 percent.For officials and experts, besides illiteracy, the long tradition of preventing women from outside exposure is another reason behind poor participation of women in government jobs.“The women in Province 2, particularly the Madhesi women, are largely illiterate and it’s reflected in their interest to participate in the government jobs,” said Manchala Jha, a woman activist and former member of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. “If you don’t have enough qualified women to participate in exams to be conducted by the Public Service Commission, how can we expect their better participation?” said Jha.Since Civil Service Act 2007 made the provision of reservation for various marginalised groups including women, the participation of women in civil service is on the rise. As per the law, 55 percent of the total seats have to be filled through open competition while the remainder are reserved for various marginalised groups in section officer positions. Of the remaining 45 percent of the reserved seats, the quota includes 33 percent for women, 27 percent for indigenous nationalities, 22 percent for Madhesis, 9 percent for Dalits, 5 percent for the disabled, and 4 percent for backward regions. This greatly contributes to increasing women’s representation in the civil service, according to officials and experts.The presence of women civil servants was 11 percent in the fiscal year 2007-08, which increased to around 25 percent in the fiscal year 2018-19, according to the Department of Civil Personnel Records.But, when it comes to entry of women from Province 2 in the civil service, their number has remained poor. For example, last year, the commission recommended 940 candidates from Province 2 for civil service jobs, but only 181 were women, representing 20 percent of total recommended candidates from the province. The average ratio of women’s entry into civil service in the last fiscal year 2018-19 stood at 31.65 percent, according to the commission.“Compared to other provinces, women in Madhesi community have lower exposure to education and the outside world, which limits their ability to participate and pass the exam,” said Anil Thakur, secretary at the Prime Minister’s Office, who belongs to Madhesi community. The Madhesi community has a dominant presence in the province.“There is also a language barrier for them as well as they cannot communicate properly in both Nepali and English compared to men who are better exposed to both languages,” said Thakur.Officials and experts, however, said that the changes are coming even though it may be slow. “People in Madhes are understanding the importance of education for girls. Particularly, women from the higher castes in Tarai are more educated and they are increasingly coming out of their household chores and fighting for the government jobs,” said Jha.Underscoring the need for women empowerment in Tarai, Province 2 government has run “Beti Bachau, Beti Padhau” or “Save Girls, Educate Girls” campaign since January this year. Under the scheme, every newborn girl child will be insured in all of the Province’s eight districts. The girls will receive their insurance amount as a lump sum after they get their citizenship certificates. Each of the insured girls will receive Rs125,000 for education. Jha said that the campaign is also aimed at educating women in order to empower them.","Published at : November 25, 2019",Kathmandu,Prithvi Man Shrestha
Rautahat residents criticise inhumane animal transportation,"A common sight along the Gaur-Chandranigahapur road section in Rautahat district is that of poultry traders ferrying chickens on motorcycles and bicycles. The chickens to be sold to butchers in various parts of the district make their journey hanging upside down, with their feet tied together. Traders in the district transport chickens in an inhumane manner for slaughter, with some traders transporting up to 50 fowls at a time on one motorbike, says Binod Pandey, chairman of the poultry trader’s association in the district. Mistreatment of animals was criminalised in 2016, under the new Criminal Code. According to Clause 290 of the Code, with an exception for training or improving its physical capacity, anyone found guilty of behaving cruelly with birds or animals is liable to three months in jail and Rs 5,000 fine or both. Similarly, Clause 291 says, with an exception for religious purposes, anyone found guilty of killing birds and animals in public places is liable to one month in jail and Rs 5,000 fine or both.Khadga Mainali, chief at Livestock Service Centre in the district, said that farm animals cannot be transported to slaughterhouses in a cruel manner. “Poultry traders have been found violating the law constantly,” said Mainali, adding that his office is going to hold a discussion with concerned stakeholders to solve the problem.Pandey said they have been requesting traders to stop the inhumane treatment of animals and fowls. “But they don’t pay attention to our request. There have been times when poultry traders have even misbehaved with us when we have asked them to treat the animals in a better way,” said Pandey. Although animal rights activists in the area have been sternly protesting against the inhumane transportation of farm animals, traders are still transporting animals—including birds and ducks—in a cruel manner. Basu Dhungana, an animal rights activist, said that more stringent action needs to be taken against the traders. “The vehicles [which transport animals] should be wide enough for animals to move about and breathe comfortably. There is a law in place to deter such inhumane behaviour, but it’s not effective,” he said. According to him, it’s illegal to keep animals in a vehicle for more than eight hours without unloading them for resting, feeding and drinking water.“However, traders are found transporting livestock from Saruatha, Rajapur, Garuda, including other areas, to Kathmandu for more than eight hours without rest, feed and water,” said Dhungana.Last year, the Supreme Court issued an interim order asking the government to ensure that livestock are transported humanely. A petition was also filed by advocates Padam Bahadur Shrestha and Shatkon Shrestha to control inhumane transportation of farm animals.","Published at : November 23, 2019",Rautahat,Shiva Puri

Destruction of biodiversity corridor for Nijgadh airport could be disastrous for wild elephants,"The proposed Nijgadh International Airport site is adjacent to Parsa National Park and is home to endangered wildlife and an important biodiversity corridor at the foothills of the Chure range. Conservationists fear that the construction of the airport will destroy the natural biodiversity corridor used by the wildlife of the national park, especially those used by wild elephants. Read: Eight companies from seven countries are vying for the bid to build Nijgadh International AirportConservationists suggest leaving some parts of the forest in Bara district untouched to conserve the traditional migratory corridor used by wild elephants. “The authorities must consider the wildlife that lives in these parts. They must consider the damage that will be done to the endangered wild elephants that use the corridor,” said Ashok Ram, an assistant conservation officer of the park. “Two kilometres of forest land in the western part of Bakeya stream and three kilometres of forest land in the southern part of the East-West Highway should be left untouched to conserve the migratory pathway of elephants,” he said.Read: Tourism minister vows to build Nijgadh airport at any costSprawling over an area of 8045.79 hectares, the proposed airport would require felling of 2.4 million trees. As per the project’s Environment and Social Impact Assessment report, nearly 770,000 trees will be chopped down during the first phase. Nearly 90 percent of the project’s area is covered by Shorea robusta trees also known as saal or sakhua.Conservationists worry about the lack of proper homework by the authorities before initiating clearance of the forest area for the construction of the airport. Amir Maharjan, chief conservation officer at the park, said that authorities plan to start the construction work of the airport soon while the fate of the wildlife of the forest remains undecided. “Initiating construction work disturbing the biodiversity corridor will have a direct effect on the native elephants in the park. The elephants take the same migratory route every year and destroying it will definitely have an impact on the annual migratory pattern of the wild elephants.”Since elephants are among the most intelligent and sensitive animals, who follow established patterns of behaviour, any disturbance in their traditional corridor will have a long-lasting effect on the population of the wild elephants at the park, conservationists say. “Concerned stakeholders should have carried out intensive study and research before giving a green signal to the project, but if their plans are already in order they must at least make efforts to conserve the migratory pathway of elephants before the start of construction work of the airport,” said Maharhan. Ram, who has been doing his doctoral research on elephants’ movement, insists that some of the forest lands in the northern border of the proposed airport should be left untouched to conserve the traditional pathway of elephants.Every year, elephants from Parsa breed with elephants from Sunsari and Sindhuli, by using this corridor to meet. Interbreeding not only maintains elephant population but also ensures that their gene pools stay diverse and healthy. According to Ram, disrupted migration will not only affect the flow of elephants but also the exchange of genes. He said, “If the elephants do not use their usual route, it could significantly reduce their population.” In total, there are 225 wild elephants in various national forests, national parks and wildlife reserves across the country. It has been estimated that there are 100 to 110 elephants in Bardiya, 45 to 50 in Chitwan/Parsa, eight in Sindhuli, 13 to 14 in Koshi, 19 to 20 in Jhapa and 20 to 25 in Suklaphanta.","Published at : November 20, 2019",Parsa,Shankar Acharya
Local farmers in Betauna demand re-evaluation of compensation for Bardibas-Simara railway track,"Residents of Betauna in Chandrapur Municipality, Rautahat, are demanding authorities to re-evaluate the compensation amount fixed by the Compensation Fixation Committee of the East-West Electric Railway. The survey work of the railway project has been halted for the past two weeks due to the protest.“We have urged concerned authorities, various political parties, and their leaders to address our demand. We won’t let the railway project resume its work unless the authorities re-evaluate the compensation amount for the land acquired for the construction,” said Pradip Basnet, the vice-chairman of a struggle committee formed by locals to press their demands. Stating that the compensation amount fixed by the Compensation Fixation Committee is far less than the current value of land, the agitating locals had submitted memorandums to the Ministry of Home Affairs through the District Administration Office, Department of Railways, Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, District Land Revenue Office, Survey Office and Chandrapur Municipality to address their demand. The committee has fixed the compensation amount ranging from Rs 300,000 to Rs 1.6 million per kattha of land.But the landowners claim the current land price in the area is at least Rs 1 million per kattha.The protesting locals had stopped the railway project’s employees from conducting a survey in Betauna two weeks ago, claiming that the authorities concerned paid no heed to their demands. The residents barred the project employees from using their vehicles; padlocked the office of Chandrapur Municipality, and disrupted transportation in Chandrapur a few days ago.“Local farmers have been compelled to protest to receive suitable compensation. The government should immediately re-evaluate the compensation through a Cabinet meeting. The farmers should be saved from this injustice,” said Nepali Congress lawmaker Dev Prasad Timalsina.Local leaders of major parties have also expressed their solidarity with the agitating farmers. “Discussions are being held with authorities regarding the re-evaluation of the compensation amount. We have urged the authorities to take a decision in favour of the farmers,” said Yubaraj Bhattarai, the district in-charge of Nepal Communist Party. Bhattarai, on behalf of the agitating farmers, had submitted a memorandum to Home Minister Ram Bahadur Thapa a few weeks ago.The Mechi-Mahakali Electric Railway is one of the projects under the government’s National Pride Project. The 945 km railway line is proposed to pan Mechi in the east to Mahakali in the west. Currently, the survey and submission of a detailed project report for the 108-km Bardibas-Simara section of the railway line are underway.","Published at : November 18, 2019",Rautahat,Shiva Puri
Judge and attorney dealing with Alam case leave district,"Deepak Dhakal, the district judge of Rautahat who gave a verdict to send accused Mohammad Aftab Alam to prison, and Khadindraraj Katwal, the district attorney who had filed a charge sheet against Alam demanding life imprisonment, left Rautahat district on Friday citing that they are on leave.Police escorted Dhakal to Chandranigahapur from Gaur, the district headquarters of Rautahat, at 9 pm on Friday. Dhakal headed to Kathmandu the same night.Gunaraj Parajuli, the registrar at the court, said, “The district judge left the district, as he felt pressured and threatened while dealing with Alam’s case. We can’t say what will happen next.” On Friday, Alam was remanded in judicial custody after his formal trial came to an end. The Nepali Congress lawmaker was arrested on October 13 for his involvement in a bomb blast in Fradahawa, Rajpur, in Rautahat, on April 9, 2008, and the subsequent murder of at least 23 people in the district. Alam was elected to the federal parliament from Rautahat-2 in the 2017 elections.Meanwhile, attorney Katwal said he is on leave to rest, and it has nothing to do with any security threat.“The higher level asked me about the security threat that I could face relating to Alam’s case. But I told them that I hadn’t faced any such threats until now,” said Katwal, “I felt pressured while working on Alam’s case. That’s why I am on leave. I don’t know whether I will return to the district or not.”On Monday, Gauri Shankar Ram Chamar, one of the witnesses in the trial of Alam, had filed a written testimony at the Rautahat District Court, claiming that he was injured when a cooking gas cylinder went off at his home. However, on Tuesday, Chamar, who is currently under police protection, retracted his statement, saying that he had testified under duress. He said he was abducted and told to change his statement.The District Court had begun a formal trial on Alam’s case on November 7. Police have registered ‘attempted murder’ and ‘holding, transporting explosive materials’ charges against him, and he also faces charges of burning injured people alive in a brick kiln ""to destroy evidence"".Alam, who was sent to Gaur Prison on Friday, was transferred to Kathmandu-based Nakhu Jail at midnight. Bhupendra Khatri, superintendent of police, said Alam was sent to Kathmandu because of security threats. “The Court has given us permission to transfer Alam to other prisons if Gaur Prison isn’t secure enough,” said Khatri.","Published at : November 16, 2019",Rautahat,Shiva Puri
"As reputed lawyers flock to Alam’s defense, many question their moral judgment","When Nepali Congress leader Mohammad Aftab Alam was arrested last month on the charge of a 12-year-old mass murder, it drew national attention. Many among the public wondered how state functionaries worked in cahoots not to implicate him, thereby promoting impunity. But days after a charge sheet was filed against Alam, the focus shifted to his team of defence lawyers. The names have since raised eyebrows.A slew of senior and renowned lawyers, including former Attorney General Raman Shrestha and senior advocates Sher Bahadur KC, Prem Bahadur Khadka and Sunil Pokharel, were among the 33 lawyers defending Alam at the Rautahat District Court. Last week, following a report in the Naya Patrika daily, a fresh debate has sparked over whether these high profile legal practitioners who have been at the forefront of rule of law and civil liberties should have been defending a person standing trial for a heinous crime.For lawyers, a case is a case, some analysts say, while others question the lawyers’ moral compass because they have chosen to defend a person facing such a horrendous offence.Read: Aftab Alam remanded in judicial custody after his formal trial ended on Friday“It’s up to the individual how they uphold their moral values and draw a line when it comes to choosing a case,” said Shree Hari Aryal, chairperson of Transparency International, who is also a senior advocate. “At least those who have established themselves in the social and public spheres as the champions of civic movements and served as the attorney general should refrain from defending cases of grave crimes.”Since the attorney general serves as the government’s legal counsel and criminal cases like murder are government cases, senior lawyers were unanimous in saying the attorney general should not defend an accused.Read: A witness in Alam trial says he was abducted and forced to change statementBut Raman Shrestha, who served as the attorney general from from August 8, 2016 to August 17, 2017, disagrees.“It’s natural for folks to say I shouldn’t take the case because they are unaware of what defence lawyers actually do,” Shrestha told the Post. “The job of a defence lawyer is to assist the suspect in gathering absolving evidence and protect them from violations of their rights by law enforcement agencies and officials.” But Shrestha is not the only former attorney general who is involved in the case. Yubaraj Sangraula, who also served as the attorney general from the first week of January 2011 to the second week of August the same year, is one of the lawyers pleading on behalf of the accusers.Sangraula told the Post that the day he stepped down as attorney general, he had vowed not to argue in defence of anyone accused in criminal offences because he, in the capacity of the attorney general, led a mechanism that argues from the government’s side on behalf of the victims.“Lawyers’ priority should be the protection of justice; not defending those indulged in severe crimes,” said Sangraula. “It is unethical, particularly for former attorneys general, to defend such cases.”But the debate over what kinds of cases reputed lawyers—especially when they have held high positions—should take up is not new. Mohammad Aftab Alam in Rauthat District Court.  Post File PhotoIn the United States, Ronald S Sullivan, Jr, who had earned accolades for devoting much of his career to representing less-privileged defendants, was in the centre of controversy earlier this year after he joined the team defending Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, who was facing sexual assault charges.Sullivan, who is widely praised for his work on behalf of people who have been unfairly incarcerated, held a dean’s post at Harvard University when he joined Weinstein’s team in late January.The move created quite an uproar, with students demanding his ouster. In May, Harvard University removed him from deanship. The school, however, also earned a fair share of criticism for that decision.In India, one of the country’s most celebrated lawyers, Ram Jethmalani, often used to make headlines—and earn censure—for defending not only the rich and powerful but also criminals and terrorists.In defence of his decision to sign on Alam’s team, Shrestha, the former attorney general, also cited Jethmalani, saying the Indian criminal lawyer defended several people accused of heinous crimes like murder, rape and terrorism. “Because that was his job as a lawyer,” Shrestha said.For Shrestha, high profile cases are a test of an advocate’s competence.Various people from Shrestha’s fraternity the Post spoke to also cited other examples from across the world where renowned advocates have faced public criticism for defending those accused of heinous crimes.But a senior advocate, who did not want to be named, said being renowned in one’s area of expertise and defending the accused on the grounds that “it’s the job of a lawyer” is only half the story.“Some of the lawyers who have made names for themselves as top criminal lawyers in Nepal have also projected themselves as the torchbearers of rule of law. If their priority is earning money, they should stop calling themselves civil society leaders,” the lawyer told the Post.Some advocates who once led the Nepal Bar Association are also in Alam’s team and this is a cause for concern, according to the advocate, as the organisation has always been at the forefront of several civil movements in Nepal—including during the 2006 people’s movement.A few months ago, senior advocate Bhimarjun Acharya also courted controversy for defending Chudamani Sharma, who had been charged with amassing millions of rupees through illegal means. Acharya also defended his position saying it’s his job.According to Acharya, professional ethics should prevail over social perception while deciding on which cases lawyers should take up.“I had taken different factors into consideration before taking Sharma’s case, including what was reported [in the media] about Sharma’s corruption,” Acharya told the Post. “I decided not to join Alam’s defence team and that is my decision.”According to the senior advocate who spoke on the condition of anonymity, most of the high-profile lawyers in the country are also considered opinion-makers on pertinent national issues, and their views matter.“The point is if you defend Alam or Sharma, you should stop calling yourself a civil society leader. The choice is yours.”Alam, who won the 2017 parliamentary elections on the Nepali Congress ticket, faces charges of burning 16 to 23 people—they were injured in a bomb blast during the 2008 Constituent Assembly elections—alive with the intent to “destroy evidence”.After his arrest last month, police had filed a charge sheet against him on November 4, demanding life sentence. On Friday, Rautahat District Court sent Alam to judicial custody.The final verdict is pending, but Alam’s case, according to advocates, has certainly brought a crucial point to the fore: whether there should be a parameter within which high profile advocates work.","Published at : November 16, 2019",Kathmandu,Binod Ghimire
Aftab Alam remanded in judicial custody after his formal trial ended on Friday,"Mohammad Aftab Alam has been remanded in judicial custody after his formal trial came to an end on Friday. The Nepali Congress lawmaker was in police custody since his arrest in connection with an explosion and the subsequent murder of at least 23 people in Rautahat 12 years ago.Gunaraj Parajuli, the registrar of the Rautahat District Court, said that the court has sent Alam to prison after the end of the formal trial. “The judge gave a verdict to send accused Alam to prison on the basis of the evidence available with the court,” he said.After the end of the formal trial, Judge Deepak Dhakal had asked victim Shree Narayan Singh and defendant Alam about the incident.

Electricity poles stand in the middle of the road in Sarlahi,"The 30-km Hariban-Kaudena road, connecting the Postal Highway to the East-West Highway in Sarlahi, is being blacktopped without removing the electricity poles. Pappu Construction, which is notorious for carrying out substandard construction work and leaving most of its projects incomplete, is the contractor for the project. The road, which was originally 18 to 20 feet wide, was later widened to 30 feet, but it did not see much vehicular movement because it wasn’t blacktopped. However, recently, after the road started being asphalted, a problem arose: the risk for accidents increased, because some of the road’s electricity poles were not removed before it was widened, which means they remain almost in the middle of the road.Jogendra Thakur, a local man of Kabilashi, said that electricity poles were installed in the area a long time ago. “After the expansion of the road, some of the electricity poles were standing in the middle of the road. The position of these poles poses a grave danger to vehicles,” said Thakur. “Every day the road witnesses minor accidents because of these poles.” The locals are demanding the electricity poles be removed and shifted to a safer location but their demands have fallen on deaf ears. According to the Infrastructure Development Contact Unit Office in the district, Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) showed no urgency to shift the electricity poles. Arun Kumar Mahato, a site engineer at the office, said that the NEA did not help the office clear the poles before blacktopping work began. He said, “We requested the Lalbandi branch of NEA to remove the poles from the road time and again but there was no help forthcoming. That’s why the contractor has been blacktopping the road without clearing the poles.”A budget has been separated to clear the road of electricity poles but it remains untouched, said Mahato. The Lalbandi branch of NEA has asked the Infrastructure Development Contact Unit Office to transfer the budget to its account for them to be able to remove the electricity poles. “But we cannot transfer the budget provided by the World Bank into NEA’s account. It’s against the contract we have with the World Bank,” said Mahato.The road is being blacktopped with the financial assistance of the World Bank.The NEA office in Lalbandi informed that for any clearance work for road construction an application should be registered in the office. “We should first receive the application and then the money should be deposited on NEA’s bank account as estimated,” said Sudhir Yadav, chief at Lalbandi branch of NEA. “We cannot work until the concerned authority fulfils the due process.”The contractor company claimed that they have already completed 80 percent of construction work on the Hariban-Kaudena. However, locals claim that the contractor has used substandard materials as some sections of the blacktopped road has developed cracks and potholes. Rameshwor Sah, a local of Kabilashi, said that the Hariban-Kaudena road, the shortest route connecting the Postal Highway to the East-West Highway, is being constructed without much deliberation on the quality. “The road is currently being blacktopped but it’s already developed cracks. The section of the road passing through my locality was blacktopped just three months ago but it’s already full of potholes,” he said.Pappu Construction was awarded the contract of the road at a cost of Rs 179.2 million on May 4, 2016. The agreement says had set the deadline for the contractor company to complete the construction work by May 20, 2018. Since then, the deadline for the road project has been extended time and again. Subodh Raya, a local man of Haripur, said that the contractor company has been working on the road stretch just for the sake of completing the work. He said, “The tar’s come off in many places and the contractor company has not initiated any repairs. This construction work here has only created more problems for the locals. We have become wary of vehicles running on this road lest they meet with accidents,” said Raya.","Published at : November 15, 2019",Sarlahi,Om Prakash Thakur
‘Beti Bachau-Beti Padhau’ campaign fails to take off this year in the absence of employees,"The ‘Beti Bachau-Beti Padhau’ campaign—an insurance scheme to encourage girl education—has failed to take off effectively this fiscal year. The scheme that was introduced on January 15, 2019, has been affected since the Chief Minister’s Office in Province 2 is yet to hire employees to implement the scheme through every local unit. Ram Joti Sah, a local of Nigaul in Gaushala, went to the Chief Minister’s Office in Janakpur with her daughter-in-law to insure her newly-born granddaughter but had to come back disappointed, she said. “This is the third visit in one week to the Chief Minister’s Office for my granddaughter. Like before, we are again returning without getting the job done.” In the absence of employees dedicated to the scheme at the local level, the Chief Minister’s Office has temporarily gone back to the original plan of running the campaign through the Chief Minister’s Office. However, four months into this fiscal year, not a single employee has been hired for the scheme.According to the Chief Minister and Office of Council of Ministers in Province 2, the campaign has been halted until mid-January 2020. On Wednesday, the office notified service seekers that the campaign will be resumed at the local units once the 136 vacant posts of employees are filled. Under the scheme, which is often referred to as a pet project of Chief Minister of Province-2 Lal Babu Raut, every newborn girl is to be insured across all eight districts in the province. According to the Chief Minister’s Office, a girl child is eligible for the insurance scheme once she receives her citizenship certificate. “The girls will receive a lump sum insurance amount of Rs 125,000 for education,” said Priyanka Yadav, the coordinator of the campaign. Isarail Shesh of Samsi in Mahottari also has been frequenting the Chief Minister’s Office to claim insurance for his newborn granddaughter. “The officials at the office don’t pay attention to us. For the past week, I have been carrying my young granddaughter to and from the office but nobody has come forward with any information,” he said.Yadav said that the office had already opened 4,372 bank accounts for girls under the insurance scheme in the last fiscal year. She said, “In the last four months, we have prepared more than 5,000 insurance forms from Saptari, Siraha, Dhanusha, Mahottari, Sarlahi, Rautahat, Bara and Parsa districts.”According to her, the office has started the process to recruit employees to fill in the vacancies announced by the Chief Minister’s Office. “We will soon appoint employees in the respective local units to facilitate the service seekers,” she said. The Chief Minister’s Office had started the insurance policy with the hope of achieving a milestone in stopping child marriage and dowry system prevalent in the region. Under the Beti Bachau-Beti Padhau campaign, 14,000 bicycles were distributed to girls and 100 toilets were constructed for girl students in Province 2 in the last fiscal year.","Published at : November 14, 2019","Dhanusha,",Santosh Singh
A witness in Alam trial says he was abducted and forced to change statement,"Gauri Shankar Ram Chamar, one of the witnesses in the trial of Nepali Congress lawmaker Mohammad Aftab Alam, has said that he was abducted by Alam’s supporters and forced to file a false court testimony to protect Alam.  Chamar was injured in the 2008 Rautahat blast in which Alam has been implicated along with the murder of at least 23 people.Read: Two witnesses in Alam trial change their statementsOn Monday, Chamar had filed a written testimony at the Rautahat District Court, claiming that he was injured when a cooking gas cylinder exploded at his home.

They forced me to change my statement. They also offered me money to change my statement. What I told the court yesterday (Monday) is not true.

Encroachment of national forest land unchecked in Rautahat,"People are constructing houses by encroaching the national forest area at Betauna in Chandrapur Municipality, Rautahat, say forest officials.The people, some of them landless squatters who had been living on the edge of the forest, have started to move into the forest area and build permanent structures. “The encroachers have been using the forest land for a decade now so we cannot evict them overnight. We are currently monitoring the situation and will look into various measures we can take to stop the encroachment of the Betauna forest area,” said division forest officer Binod Singh.Encroachment of forest land is rife in the district, according to the forest office. The data available at the division forest office shows the total national forest land in Rautahat to be 29,400 hectares. Meanwhile, a report prepared by the division forest office last year shows that 3,500 hectares of forest land have been encroached in the district. The forest encroachment, according to the division forest office, is rampant mainly in Betauna, Banbohari, Gaidatar, Judibela, Kanakpur, Jangalsaiya, Santapur, Rangapur, Maira, Balarikhor, Bagmati and Bholantar. To curb forest encroachment, the forest office had launched an eviction drive seven years ago. But it was unsuccessful, mainly due to the political protection of the encroachers. Forest officials claimed that major political parties had exerted pressure on them not to evict forest land encroachers, as they are their vote bank.However, the encroachers say they are willing to leave the forest area if the state makes provisions for them to settle elsewhere. “I don’t own any land to build a house on. I don’t have any alternative but to live in public land,” said Sukhal Sah, who built her house by encroaching forest land in Betauna. According to Sah, political leaders have assured them multiple times of a permanent solution to end their landless state, but nobody has kept their promises. “We don’t want to encroach the forest land, but we have no alternative,” said Sah.","Published at : November 11, 2019",Rautahat,Shiva Puri

The District Police Office said it was unaware about the closure of the health post and the ward office. “We just deployed police personnel for election security. We did not know that the ward office and the health post were closed for the poll,” said Deputy Superintendent of Police Tilak Bharati.Chairman of the local unit Yadav admitted to closing the office building for the election but denied the claim that daily services were affected.“The ward secretary and other staffers were providing services from outside the office,” Yadav claimed.","Published at : November 6, 2019",Rajbiraj,Abdhesh Kumar Jha
"In Rautahat, people from Dalit communities continue to face ostracisation during Chhath celebrations","In the eastern banks of the Chadi River, in Chandrapur Municipality-5, Chhath celebrations are going on in full swing. For the festivities, however, three spots are designated for three different communities; one for the people from the Chaudhary caste, one for the Dalit Musahars and one for the Ram community.Ram Ramita Devi, who was celebrating the festival on the riverbanks on Saturday, said she is “mildly hurt” by this demarcation of celebration areas. “They (people from the so-called upper-caste) bar us from entering their area of celebration. They even restrict us from bringing mud to prepare makeshift temples,” Ramita Devi said. However, Jagadish Thakur, another devotee, claimed that no such demarcation on celebration space has been made. But on a recent ground trip, the Post found that the people from separate castes were celebrating the festival in separate spaces.“This practice has been in place for as long as I can remember,” Ramita Devi told the Post.","Published at : November 3, 2019",Rautahat,Shiva Puri
Owner and manager of a leather factory in Parsa Bara arrested over Sirsiya stream pollution,"The District Police Office in Parsa arrested a Chinese national, Liuta Chuang (36), owner of a leather factory in Parsa Bara Industrial Corridor and his manager, an Indian national, Tinjung Gurung (35), on the charge of polluting the Sirsiya stream in Chorni in Birgunj Metropolitan City.The duo was arrested from the premises of the leather factory on Wednesday. “Although we requested the factory management to stop dumping toxic waste into the stream, they did not listen to our request,” said Gautam Thapa, deputy superintendent of police. He said, “Chuang and Gurung were arrested after the locals filed a complaint against the leather factory.”Industrial waste from the Parsa-Bara Industrial Corridor, which houses over 3,400 factories, has become a major contributor to the pollution of the Sirsiya stream, say local authorities. The stream, which flows through the central part of the Birgunj Metropolis, was home to aquatic life such as fish, turtles and crabs before the stream turned toxic with industrial waste, say locals.Surendra Prasad Kurmi, a Birgunj local who is also the coordinator of the Sirsiya Stream Pollution Free Campaign, said, “The locals of Birgunj have been struggling to save the Sirsiya stream for the last two decades. Nobody has taken any action against the industries until now. Hopefully, this will deter other industries from turning Sirsiya into a dumping ground.” According to Kurmi, last year local campaigners filed cases in the District Court against nine industries operating in the corridor. The campaigners have also filed cases against all 43 industries of the corridor in Birgunj High Court on September 25.Most of the industries manufacture textiles, pharmaceuticals, steels, leather goods, chemicals, liquors, ghee, and soaps. For the residents of Birgunj Metropolis and around one dozen villages in Parsa and Bara districts, the Sirsiya stream holds religious significance. Every year the locals gather on the banks of the stream to observe Chhath but the pollution in the stream is making it difficult for them to go near the stream, said Ganesh Patel, a local man. According to him, the establishment of the industrial corridor in 1979 and its development over the years proved disastrous for the Sirsiya stream. “We would depend on the stream for our water needs—to cook, clean, bathe and feed our livestock—but that has become unimaginable with every passing year,” he said. The stream has been poisoned to the extent that it does not support any life form, he added. The industries and the local administrations in Parsa and Bara districts had come to an understanding wherein the industries had agreed to not dump waste into the Sirsiya stream during the Chhath festival to allow the locals to observe Chhath by the stream. But the move remained ineffective in combatting water pollution with the industries dumping waste into the stream soon after Chhath.A decade ago, a committee headed by Ritesh Tripathi was formed to mitigate pollution in the stream and it had identified 48 sources as major pollutants; 46 of them were factories and industries inside the corridor. The committee had recommended the concerned factories and industries to install wastewater treatment plants. But the recommendation was largely snubbed. Hardly two to four industries heeded the committee’s advice.","Published at : November 1, 2019",Parsa,Shankar Acharya

MBBS students of National Medical College on protest,"The MBBS students of National Medical College staged a demonstration in Birgunj on Thursday, demanding return of the extra amount charged by the college.The agitating students accused the college administration of charging them an additional fee ranging from Rs 1.2 to 1.5 million on various pretexts on top of the fee fixed by the government. There was a brief clash between the protesting students and a group of youths, who were reportedly mobilised by Basaruddin Ansari, the managing director of the college.“We were holding a peaceful protest on the college premises when a group of thugs hired by Ansari hired tried to attack us. They vandalised the microphone and manhandled some students,” said Naresh Bhattarai, a member of the struggle committee formed by the protesting students.Ansari denied the accusation. He said the clash broke out when a group of senior students tried to stop the protesters for causing disturbance.“On Wednesday, I’d assured the students that I would return their fees if other medical colleges do the same. The students from Chitwan Medical College persuaded our students into staging a protest,” said Ansari.Following the clash, the agitating students moved their rally to the streets of Birgunj. They demanded immediate return of the additionally charged amount.The MBBS students allege that the college also charged them additional amount in the name of library fees, sports fees, internet fees, cafeteria fees, hostel fees even to dayscholars, among others. “It is not mandatory to stay in the college hostel. But the college has been charging the amount from each student whether s/he stays in the hostel or not,” said a student preferring anonymity.","Published at : October 25, 2019",Birgunj,Bhusan Yadav
"Rautahat continues to see dengue patients, health officials say","When dengue epidemic was at its peak across the country in August and September, the health department of Chandrapur Municipality had launched several campaigns to raise awareness among locals on the precautions to be taken to control dengue. The campaigns continued till last week.But as the epidemic has subsided across the country, it has not in Rautahat, say health department representatives. So far, Rautahat has seen a total of 18 dengue-infected patients, and the number is on the rise with hospitals seeing fresh patients every day. According to hospital officials, about a dozen patients suspected of dengue are diagnosed every day. Representatives of the municipality have visited several eateries and vehicle workshops in the city—since the water stored in drums and tyres make for an ideal breeding ground for mosquitoes— and directed the owners to clear the area of stagnant water accumulated in unused tyres.“Our inspection team has found that mosquitoes that breed inside the tyres of vehicles are most responsible for transmitting dengue,” said Abhay Thakur, head of the health department in Chandrapur Municipality. “Water stored in pots and drums in households also breed mosquitoes. Even as the rain has subsided, rainwaters are still stored in tyres and drums, which is why we continue to see fresh dengue patients every day.”The health department of the municipality since July this year has been launching campaigns to contain dengue. The municipality has founded committees in all of its 10 wards, appointing representatives to aware the locals on dengue epidemic.But according to Thakur, even though the campaigns have been successful, various workshop owners in the town have been reluctant to clean their space even after repeated requests.“Even as monsoon has ended, the fear of dengue has not,” Thakur said.","Published at : October 24, 2019",Rautahat,Shiva Puri

Pangolin conservation runs effectively in Makwanpur’s buffer zone community forests,"A community-based anti-poaching unit, which was formed three years ago to control poaching and illegal trafficking of endangered pangolins in two buffer zone community forests in Makwanpur district, has been effective in conserving pangolins in the area.As part of its conservation efforts, for the past three years, the unit has been raising awareness in the settlements in the buffer zone areas about the importance of conserving pangolins, in coordination with the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), a charity devoted to the worldwide conservation of animals and their habitats.According to the field office of the ZSL in Parsa, the awareness programmes are fruitful. Prachanda Maharjan, an administrative officer of the ZLS, said that they have been making joint efforts with Padampokhari Community Forest Users Group and Chuchche Khola Community Forest Users Group to conserve pangolins.In 2017, two buffer zone community forests were declared pangolin conservation areas. Maharjan said, “We have been informing locals that pangolins are farmers friendly wild animal. They are regarded as a natural pest controller. ”According to him, these species play a positive role in the ecosystem. Maharjan said, “Pangolins search for prey by digging the farmlands due to which the farmlands become fertile.”After being aware of the role pangolins play in making soil fertile, locals have had a shift in attitude towards the animals and have rescued and handed over nine pangolins to the unit from the Chuchche Khola Community Forest until now. “Today, locals are well aware of the importance of pangolins. They are also not afraid of pangolins anymore. Even if they find pangolins near human settlement they handed over them to the unit,” said Maharjan.Pangolin, also called a scaly anteater, is a shy, non-aggressive, nocturnal, burrowing mammal. A total of eight species of pangolins are found in the world—four in Africa and four in Asia. Eastern districts across the Chure range, such as Sindhupalchok, Kavrepalanchok, Bhaktapur, Makawanpur, Dhading and some western districts are prime habitats of two genera of the Asian pangolin—Chinese pangolin (Kalo salak) and Indian pangolin (Rato salak) in Nepal.Conservationists globally allege that pangolins are being poached at a rate that is over 3,000 times higher than that of rhinos. Pangolin scales are used in traditional Chinese medicine, as the scales are believed to cure illnesses, heart diseases, cancer and female reproductive disorders. Pangolin meat is considered a delicacy and is in high demand in both China and Vietnam.Because of this, all pangolin species are currently listed under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora Appendix II. It is also protected in Nepal under the National Park and Wildlife Conservation Act 1973. As per the rule, anyone involved in trading in pangolins (conserved species) could be slapped a fine of up to Rs 500,000 and one year to 10 years jail term.","Published at : October 21, 2019",Parsa,Shankar Acharya
Congress lawmaker Mohammad Aftab Aalam remanded in custody for five more days,"The Rautahat District Court on Sunday remanded Nepali Congress lawmaker Mohammad Aftab Alam to five more days in judicial custody.Alam, also a former minister, was arrested on October 13 in connection with a bomb blast and subsequent murder of as many as 23 people in Rautahat in 2008.On October 15, the court had decided to remand him in custody for seven days. On Sunday, Judge Chanak Mani Aryal prolonged the custody.On April 9, 2008, some people were injured when explosives they were making, apparently at the behest of Alam, went off accidentally. The explosives were being made targeting the imminent Constituent Assembly elections, according to police. Alam, according to investigations, was involved in burning at least 23 people alive in a brick kiln to “destroy the evidence”.Two months later, Alam turned himself in to the police on June 23, 2008, after a first information report was filed identifying him as the primary accused. The Office of the Attorney General, however, decided on July 14, 2008 against pursuing a criminal case against Alam and five others.Responding to a writ petition filed on behalf of the victims, the Supreme Court in May 2012, four years after the incident, ordered that the case be moved forward.""There is enough ground to investigate further and move the case forward,"" a joint bench of judges Sushila Karki and Bharat Bahadur Karki had observed, ordering the Rautahat District Police Office to arrest those made defendants in the writ.Read: Members charged with a crime should be removed forthwithThe court order, however, had remained unimplemented, leading the petitioners to file a complaint with the Judgement Execution Directorate in March this year.Alam was arrested seven years after the Supreme Court's order.Alam was elected from Rautahat constituency-2 in the first Constituent Assembly elections of 2008. However, he lost the second Constituent Assembly elections in 2013, before going on to win the 2017 legislative elections. Alam served as a minister in the Madhav Kumar Nepal government.Meanwhile, the National Human Rights Commission said on Sunday its serious attention was drawn to various media reports concerning the investigation by the commission into the Rautahat blast.In a statement, the constitutional rights body said that the commission had initiated an on-site investigation by immediately forming an investigation panel on April 27, 2008 and submitted the report on May 12. Several orders have been issued in relation to the case, the rights body said. The watchdog also said families of the blast victims had lodged the complaint with the commission on April 24, 2008 after police refused to register the complaint.The statement noted that the Supreme Court on May 29, 2012 had issued its final verdict on the case, responding to a writ petition filed on behalf of the victims.“The apex court had mentioned the commission’s investigation while passing its verdict,” the statement read.The statement noted that, according to the National Human Rights Commission Act-2012, the commission cannot initiate action on the cases once they are lodged in a court.So the complaint is still under consideration of the commission as stipulated by the National Human Rights Commission (Action on Complaints and Compensation Determination Regulations), it said.The commission has made it clear that it doesn’t keep its reports secret except for the security of witness and victims in the incidents related to human rights violations and excesses.Stating that the reports regarding the commission’s role published and aired by certain media do not carry the truth, the commission hoped further investigation into the case could be conducted based on the verdict by the Supreme Court.","Published at : October 20, 2019",Rautahat,Shiva Puri
Parsa National Park to conduct a census of Gaur,"Parsa National Park is going to conduct a census of Gaur (Bos gaurus), commonly called Gaurigai, a protected wildlife species.According to Amir Maharjan, chief conservation officer of the park, the census will be conducted with the help of National Trust for Nature Conservation. Maharjan said, “We are going to conduct the census in winter this year, as it is a suitable time to conduct the census.”Conservationists said that they are going to use ‘Direct Sighting Method’ (which, as the name implies, means counting the animals as you see them) to count Gaurs. Maharjan said, “Technician teams will be deployed in different teams to count the animals. They will use tamed elephants to count the animal.”Officials at the park believe that the number of Gaurs has been increasing every year in the protected area. “We have estimated that there are currently 150 Gaurs in the park,” said Maharjan.Gaurs prefer to live in dry elevated areas, like in the Chure region. As per the census carried out by the park last year, there were 105 Gaurs in the park. This animal is the largest wild cattle species in the world, measuring up to two metres up to the shoulders and weighing up to 250 kg. Gaur is also found in Chitwan National Park. Conservationists said that the number of the species has been declining due to hunting, habitat loss and exposure to various diseases.The species is included as a protected mammal species list under the National Park and Wildlife Conservation Act 2029 (1973). It has also been listed in Appendix I of CITES. According to the World Wildlife Fund, Gaurs are found in eastern India, Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, southern China, and the Malay Peninsula.","Published at : October 18, 2019",Parsa,Shankar Acharya

Postal highway upgradation drive creates more problems than solutions,"Serious negligence has been detected in the blacktopping of the Bariyar-Paterwa stretch of the Postal highway, often called the ‘lifeline of the Tarai’.The 17-km stretch, which is currently being upgraded, has developed cracks and fissures only days after the road was blacktopped.Use of sub-par material and an impetuous design and estimate’ method are what has caused the problem, said a technician at the Adarshakotwal Rural Municipality, in Bara.Since detecting the problems, the office of the Postal highway in Birgunj has directed the contractor company to immediately fix the road. The office has also received complaints and criticism from locals.The contract for the project was handed over to Raman/Lokvir Construction Company in February 2016. While the deadline of the project was February 2019, the road remains incomplete. Officials at the office of the highway said that the contractor has already received about 80 percent of the contract amount.The company has started repairing the blacktopping, according to Sunil Kumar Gupta, a site engineer at the Office.While the initial work was finished, the office has refused to take over the construction after detecting cracks in the road. The road had a total budget of Rs 180million.While several sections of the road have developed cracks and erosion, other sections are left without blacktopping. There is also apparent negligence in the cleanliness of the finished sections with pebbles and concrete strewn about on the road.Manoj Jaiswal, a local of Paterwa, said that there is virtually no inspection from the office of the Postal highway, while the road continues to create more questions than answers.“The lack of cleanliness has increased the risk of accidents,” said Jaiswal. “Even though the blacktopping was expected to be beneficial, it has invited further problems, beating its own purpose.”","Published at : October 15, 2019",Bara,Laxmi Sah

Birgunj Metropolis dumping waste near no-man’s-land,"As Nepal is gearing up to make Visit Nepal 2020 a grand success by welcoming two million tourists, the country’s busiest border point in Birgunj is a sore sight to behold.The border crossing between Nepal and India has become the city’s dumping ground of sorts, an eyesore for locals and visitors alike.The city authority has been disposing of garbage in the no-man’s-land near Miteri Bridge despite protests from the people living near either side of the border. The stench emanating from garbage heaps pervades the area.Following a protest from the locals last year, the city authority had stopped dumping garbage at the border. But of late, household wastes from the city are once again being dumped in the area.The locals of Raxaul, a nearby settlement in India, have protested time and again on the use of the area as a garbage disposal site.Rajesh Barma, a resident of Raxaul, complained that the local people were greatly affected due to the negligence of Birgunj Metropolis. “Locals and visitors suffer a lot due to the garbage. It is very irresponsible of Birgunj metropolis to dump garbage in the bordering area,” said Barma. It is estimated that around 70 tonnes of wastes are collected from Birgunj every day. Birgunj is the country’s largest transit point that contributes around one-third of tax revenue. However, there is minimal tourist arrival through the border point. The metropolis hopes to change that by bringing in more tourists through the border in the year 2020. A total of 1,248 tourists entered Nepal through the Birgunj border in the last fiscal year 2017/18. In 2018/19, the figure stood at 1,222. According to tourism entrepreneurs, tourists and their guides choose the Sunauli-Bhairahawa border over the Raxaul-Birgunj border, citing that Birgunj is dirty and overcrowded with traffic jams.The landfill site in Nagawa, Birgunj, has been under construction for the past four years and the metropolis expects the construction to be completed within a month. “We have been using the no-man’s-land as garbage disposal because our landfill site is still under construction. But we hope to have it ready for use by the end of October,” said Mayor Bijaya Kumar Sarabagi.","Published at : October 4, 2019",Parsa,Shankar Acharya

People’s Housing Programme remains incomplete in Saptari,"Impoverished Dalit families in Saptari district have been left in the lurch as the construction of their houses under the People’s Housing Programme remains incomplete.In 2013, the government had announced the programme vowing to build houses for impoverished Dalit families in the district. Although the programme began on time as stated, it is struggling to reach completion mainly due to a lack of human resources and sluggish work by the local construction committee. Under the programme, 775 houses were to be built in Saptari in the last fiscal year. A committee formed in coordination with Bideshwor Prasad Yadav, a Province 2 assembly member, had collected the data of impoverished Dalit families, including Dom, Halkhor and Mester people, in the fiscal year 2018/19. But not a single house got completed last year. Around Rs 80 million of the programme’s budget was returned to the government’s coffers in the previous fiscal.This year, the committee had called for a meeting on September 12 for the resumption of the pending house construction. However, the meeting remained undecided, as the coordinator was absent from the meeting. Most of the members of the committee, who are provincial assembly members, did not attend the meeting citing hectic schedules. Krishna Dev Jha, chief at the Urban Development and Building Construction Division Office, said the construction of the houses will start after the formation of policies and verification of the list of Dom, Halkhor and Mester people. “If the meetings of the stakeholders do not take place, it will affect the construction process,” Jha said.Satya Narayan Mandal, a leader from the opposition party, said the programme has remained incomplete due to the incompetence of the provincial assembly members. “I am also a member of the provincial assembly, but I have yet to receive the working guidelines. The coordinator of the committee did not attend the meeting. How will the programme move ahead at this rate?” said Mandal.Under the People’s Housing Programme, a total of 1,133 houses are to be built in Saptari. Each recipient family will receive a budget of Rs226,000 to construct a house. Devan Sada from a Musahar community in Babhangama Katti said many impoverished people like him are suffering for want of a roof over their heads. “The government does not work for poor people like us,” said Sada.

But the construction work has not gathered momentum at all,” an Indian technician told the Post.The contractors often claim that shortage of construction materials, disputes over land acquisition, delayed payment, among other issues, caused the delay.“There is a frequent shortage of construction materials like sand and pebble which are required for sub-base construction. We cannot carry out other works without completing sub-base,” said Joshua Abraham, the project manager of Pappu Construction.Not only in the Birgunj-Thori stretch but also the progress in almost all sections of the Postal Road Project has been slow. The roads, which are aligned both North-South and East-West, connect parts of inner Tarai as well as the Nepal-India border from Bhadrapur in Jhapa to Dodhara Chandani of Kanchanpur.Construction of the Postal Highway, a national pride project, was initiated in the fiscal year 2006/07 with an aim to complete it within 2017/18.","Published at : September 30, 2019",Birgunj,Bhusan Yadav
Lower-income group benefits from clothing banks in Birgunj,"Twenty-eight-year-old Ganesh Sah, a rickshaw puller in Birgunj, can’t afford to buy new clothes for his family.But for Sah and those in his income bracket, ‘clothes banks’ set up in various places across the city have helped a great deal. “I can now pick and choose the clothes I need for me and my family, and I don’t have to pay a single rupee for them,” said Sah. “The clothes bank has been a boon for us.” Many like Sah are benefitting from the introduction of such clothes banks. These “stores” are set up with the tagline: “If you have clothes in abundance, give it to us; if you don’t, take from us.” The slogan is currently the talk of the town in Birgunj.The banks have been set up by three organisations: Green City Communal Adarshanagar, Byabasthit Birgunj Campaign and Womens’ Creation. Chair of Green City Communal Jaya Prakash Khetan said that the banks have proved to be fruitful to the target group and he is happy with the outcome. “We run with the slogan “sab ko haat, sab ko saath” (which loosely translates to ‘everybody’s contribution, everybody’s help’), and we hope to continue it for a long time,” said Khetan.Coordinator of Byabasthit Birgunj Campaign Dilip Raj Karki said that the bank is an “effort to bridge the gap between the haves and have-nots”. Karki said, “The effort has been remarkably successful in the city.” Meanwhile, Nutan Sarabargi, chair of Womens’ Creation, said that while those who can afford to spend money on clothes find themselves with clothes they hardly wear, and then there are those who struggle to buy even a single item of clothing. “We aim to end this gap,” she said. “Many social workers have even bought new clothes themselves and donated to our bank.”Brijeshwor Chaudhary, coordinator of the Birgunj Clothes Bank Main Committee, said that the bank has seen success in a limited timeframe. “The number of service givers and seekers is on the rise by the day,” he said. Chaudhary further added that the campaign will continue well through the winter. “Its importance is more during the winter, where many suffer from the cold for lack of clothing and shelter,” he said.Meanwhile, groups like Meme Birgunj and BanShakti Youth Club have also joined the fray, setting up new banks on their own.","Published at : September 28, 2019",Parsa,Shankar Acharya
A majority of Musahar children in a Rautahat village don’t go to school,"Over 100 children of Chetnagar Village in Chandrapur enrolled at the local Sindhure Ghari Secondary this academic session. But six months since the start of the session, none of the children go to school anymore.The village is a Musahar settlement which is about five kilometres east of the Gaur-Chandranigahapur road section. On a regular school day, the children can be seen running and playing all around the village. Sonawati Musahar, a local, stands close by and watches the children play. “Seeking admission at a school is not a big deal; poverty is,” Musahar said. Musahar said families in the village can barely manage two meals a day, let alone send their children to school. “People blame us for not sending our children to school, but nobody wants to know why,” said Musahar, a 40-year-old mother of five—three sons and two daughters—all of whom are of school-going age.Most families in Chandrapur have at least five children. Some families don’t send their children to school because they don’t have the necessary clothes; while others say their children have to look after their house while they go out in search of work. There are even some families who believe education is not meant for the poor. “What will a poor man’s child go to school for?” asked Musahar. On Monday, many children of school-going age were seen walking barefoot under the sweltering sun. While they have their names registered at the local community school, none of them enters the school premises. The clamour of classes being conducted in the school can be clearly heard from the settlement, but that piques the interest of the Musahar children only for a while. They all go back to their games, dragging a tin wagon and chasing each other around the village.Six months ago, the district’s Education, Development and Coordination Unit ran a school enrollment campaign in the settlement. That was when most of the Musahar children were enrolled at the local school. But the regulation has been slack, and none of the campaigners has returned to the village since then. Yagyadhog Karki, chief of the Education, Development and Coordination Unit, agrees that most children from the Musahar settlement—and other Dalit communities such as Dom and Chamar—are out of the school system. Karki said that this cycle of illiteracy in the community must break.According to Karki, the government is running various programmes such as mid-day meal to bring children from the impoverished communities into the school system. “But despite the efforts, we haven’t been able to keep the children in school,” said Karki. “Our next plan of action is to aggressively pursue a door-to-door campaign in the Musahhar settlement to request the parents to send their children to school.” Meanwhile, Nathuni Majhi, a local from Gujara, said that while the government is making efforts to bring children to school, it just isn’t enough. “You may say that our children can’t read and write and that they should learn,” Majhi said. “But you don’t know that we have bigger problems to overcome than to provide education to our children.” While the Education Unit does not have the exact data of impoverished children who are out of school in the district, Anup Majhi, a local, estimated the number to be as many as 5,000.","Published at : September 28, 2019",Rautahat,Shiva Puri

Parliamentary panel probes graft cases in Province 2,"A parliamentary committee has initiated an investigation into the reported cases of corruption in various developments projects of Province 2.The high-level parliamentary committee was formed on September 15 under Speaker Saroj Yadav following a widespread complaint that the government employees demanded a huge amount of money as commission to issue the last instalment of around 2,000 development projects in the province. Six different teams of the committee reached the project sites and started probe into the matter.The provincial ministries of physical infrastructure and development; social development and industry, forest, tourism and environment have not released the final instalment of 2,000 projects that were implemented through consumers’ committee in eight districts in Province 2.The consumers’ committees and provincial assembly lawmakers claimed that the government employees demanded up to 30 percent of the projects’ total budget as commission to release the final tranche.The committee that comprises two lawmakers of four major political parties decided to carry out a field visit as it found negligence on the part of respective ministries and the employees in regards to their roles.“The probe has been delayed as it took a long time to bring the files of those projects. We have initiated field inspection from Sunday,” said Upendra Mahato, a lawmaker who is also a member of the parliamentary committee.During the provincial assembly meeting held on September 8, the lawmakers of both the ruling and opposition parties raised the issue in Parliament stating that the government employees demanded 10 to 30 percent commission from the development project.","Published at : September 23, 2019",Janakpur,Ajit Tiwari
Province ministers divided on whether to celebrate Constitution Day or protest it,"Cabinet ministers and lawmakers of Province 2 are divided on whether they should celebrate the upcoming Constitution Day or protest it by terming the day as ‘black day’.While leaders of the ruling Samajbadi Party Nepal (SPN) are organising various programmes to mark Constitution Day, with the chief minister, ministers, lawmakers, the people’s representatives and government officials scheduled to attend different functions organised to mark the day, the Rastriya Janata Party-Nepal (RJP-N) is organising a protest programme on the day. The country is observing Constitution Day on Friday to commemorate the historic day when the present constitution of Nepal was promulgated in 2015. The federal government has declared the day a public holiday to mark the national day.Meanwhile, the provincial government has set a three-day programme—including various interaction programmes and rallies—to celebrate the occasion starting Wednesday. Chief Minister Mohammad Lalbabu Raut is also scheduled to attend the functions.The provincial government has also urged all Cabinet ministers and lawmakers to attend the programmes organised. Ministers representing SPN have also been publicly saying that all ministers must attend the functions to observe Constitution Day. However, the ministers representing the RJP-N have stated they will be boycotting all the functions, and will instead be protesting. There are 25 RJP-N lawmakers in the 107-member assembly of Province 2. Three ministers, three state ministers and a speaker were appointed from the RJP-N. Province 2 Minister for Financial Affairs Bijaya Yadav said that those ministers who do not attend the functions and ignore the Cabinet’s decision do not deserve to hold their posts. However, State Minister for Industry, Tourism, Forest and Environment Suresh Mandal said he would not attend the function organised by the provincial government on the Constitution Day. “Bullets were fired against Madhesis when the constitution was promulgated. While others were celebrating the promulgation of the constitution, we were attending funerals,” Mandal told the Post, adding that he as well his party RJP-N were protesting against the constitution as it did not incorporate rights of the Madhesi, Janjati, women, Muslim and Dalit populations.Political analyst Bijaya Prasad Mishra, who is an expert on Madhes politics, said that it did not look good on the part of the government officials to protest the constitution. “RJP-N leaders had reached a consensus and then formed the constitution,” said Mishra. “If they are against particular articles and provisions then it would be okay, but it is wrong to protest the whole constitution.” Last year too the provincial government’s ministers, lawmakers and the people’s representatives of the local units had joined an anti-constitution rally, which had invited a lot of criticism.","Published at : September 19, 2019",Janakpur,Ajit Tiwari
Shortage of essential medicines in Parsa health posts affects services,"Public health institutions have been reeling under an acute shortage of medicines in Parsa district.Of late, patients suffering from seasonal flu and other water-borne diseases are on the rise. But service seekers complain that they are deprived of treatment at the health institutions.Lahawarthakari Health Post in Pakahamainpur Rural Municipality does not even have a rehydration solution to treat diarrhoea.“The rural municipality supplied just 100 packets of rehydration solution on June 4. How long can such a meagre supply last? We have a large number of patients seeking treatment for diarrhoea, especially during the rainy season,” said Bikash Shrestha, an auxiliary health worker at the health post.The government provides 39 essential medicines free of cost through health posts. But most health posts in Parsa are out of stock of essential medicines.“Most people who visit the health post are patients of diarrhoea, viral fever and skin and ear infections. But we don’t have enough medicines in our store to treat them. We have to endure the locals’ wrath for our inability to provide them medicines,” Shrestha said.Because of the shortage of medicine in the health facilities, the local people are forced to visit either bordering Indian towns or private clinics for treatment.“I had sustained injuries on my right elbow, and I went to Lahawarthakari Health Post for treatment, but the health workers sent me away without treating me because they didn’t have the necessary medicines,” said Jhola Sah of Lahawarthakari. He said he had to go to the neighbouring Indian town to receive treatment.The residents of the rural municipality in Parsa blame the local representatives of being inactive in arranging for health supplies at the local health posts.“It’s been two years since the elected representatives assumed office, but they have done nothing to reform the health sector. The local health post does not even have iron pills or cotton for dressing wounds,” said local Prithvi Chandra Prasad. “We have to go to Indian towns to treat minor wounds despite having a health post in our own locality.”Manish Singh, the health unit chief of Pakahamainpur Rural Municipality, admitted to the short supply of medicines in the district’s health posts. He, however, blames the health workers for their negligence in managing the demand and supply of medication at the health posts.“We have rehydration solutions and other medicines in our godown. We will immediately supply them to the health facilities if they ask us to,” Singh said.But it’s not only the health posts in villages that are in short supply of essential medicines—health posts in Birgunj Metropolitan City too are lacking essential medicines. There are 16 health posts in the metropolis. Among them, the health posts at Sugauli, Bhawanipur, Alau and Harpatgunj do not have essential medicines.“There is a shortage of medicines in some health posts. The problem will be resolved within a week,” said Arun Kumar Mahato, chief of health and social development office of Birgunj Metropolis.","Published at : September 10, 2019",Birgunj,Bhusan Yadav
"Mayor, deputy mayor blame each other for the death of a person killed in clash","The longstanding dispute between the mayor and deputy mayor of Hansapur Municipality in Dhanusha district has taken a nasty turn, with each side blaming the other for the death of a local man during a clash last month.Supporters of Mayor Ramagyan Mandal and Deputy Mayor Renu Kumari Jha lodged complaints against each other at the District Police Office in Dhanusha in the Tapeshwor Mandal death row.Tapeshwor, a permanent resident of Hansapur-2, had sustained critical injuries in a clash at Baghachauda Bazaar on August 6. He succumbed to injuries during treatment at Janakpur Zonal Hospital on September 4.The violent clash ensued between the supporters of Mayor Mandal and Deputy Mayor Jha over the issue of the administrative centre of the municipality. Jha is in favour of retaining the centre at Baghachauda Bazaar, while Mandal wanted to shift the centre to Hanspur Chowk. Both of them were elected from the Rastriya Janata Party-Nepal.On Sunday, Manoj Kumar Singh, Shashi Kapar, and Sadaiya Alam filed a police complaint claiming that Deputy Mayor Jha, ward chairman of Hansapur-2 Udaya Sah and Kishori Yadav were involved in Tapeshwor’s murder.Raj Kumar Mandal, the deceased’s son, on Thursday lodged a complaint at the district police claiming that Mayor Mandal, ward chief of Hansapur-3 Udaya Kumar Singh, Shyam Raut and Lalbabu Yadav had murdered him. Raj Kumar is a supporter of the deputy chief.Bharat Sahani of Baghachauda Bazaar filed a writ petition at the Janakpur High Court last month after Mayor Mandal attempted to shift the administrative centre to Hansapur Chowk from Baghachauda Bazaar. The court gave its verdict, directing the municipal authority not to shift the centre at the time and follow the due process to shift the centre if necessary.Asked why he ignored the court’s verdict, Mayor Mandal claimed that he did not attempt to shift the administrative centre. “I just set up a temporary office in Hansapur Chowk to perform the work efficiently,” he said.Deputy Superintendent of Police Rameshwor Karki said an investigation is underway.","Published at : September 9, 2019",Janakpur,Shyam Sundar Shashi
A teenage girl was attacked with acid after her father told a man to stop pursuing her,"A 15-year-old girl was severely injured in an acid attack at Ganeshman Chowk in Birgunj at about 6am on Friday.Muskan Khatun from Chhapakaiya in Birgunj was attacked with acid by 16-year-old Samsad Miya in order to exact revenge after Khatun rebuffed his friend Majid Alam’s romantic overtures, according to police.Khatun, a ninth grader at Tribhuvan Hanuman Secondary School, was assaulted on her way to school. [Read: Meet the acid attack survivor who challenged Nepal's laws to help others like her]According to DSP Ananta Ram Sharma, spokesperson for the Parsa Police, Alam was infatuated with Khatun and had expressed his feelings for her, but was turned down. Khatun had then told her father, who met with Alam and asked him not to pursue her. Seventeen-year-old Alam is Khatun’s relative and lives in the same ward as her. “Alam was furious after his proposal was rejected,” said Sharma. “The incident seems to have been an act of revenge.” Miya was acting on Alam’s request, he said. Khatun, who suffered burns on her face, chest and hands, was admitted to the Narayani Hospital but has since been transferred to Kathmandu for further treatment, according to Sharma.“The plan to throw acid was made on Thursday night,” said Sharma. Alam and Miya had observed the Ganesh Chaturthi pooja at Chapakaiya till 1am, after which they went to a hair salon in Ganeshman Chowk, where Miya worked part-time. The two spent the night there.During a late-night conversation, Alam had asked Miya to first ask Khatun why she had stopped speaking to him.“If she doesn’t reply then throw acid on her body,” Alam reportedly told Miya, according to police.Early the next morning, the two went to a tea shop in Malpot Chowk and waited on Khatun. Miya then did what his friend had asked him to do. He went up to Khatun and asked her why she hadn’t been speaking to Alam. Khatun replied that she was getting late for school and had no reason to speak to Alam. As she tried to make her way to school, Miya threw acid on her body. Other school students then took the injured Khatun to Narayani Hospital on a rickshaw.Miya was arrested two hours later from Chhapakaiya but police are still looking for Alam, said Sharma. Instances of jilted lovers attacking women with acid have been a worrying feature in the news. In May, 20-year-old Jenny Khadka was attacked similarly by her ex-husband at Kalopul in the Capital. According to the Nepal Police, eight similar acid attack incidents were reported across the country in the past four years—three in the fiscal year 2014-15, two in 2015-16, one in 2016-17, and two in 2017-18. In the last fiscal year alone, four such attacks, including Khadka’s, have been reported from across the country.Lalbabu Raut, chief minister of Province 2, has announced that the provincial government will provide Rs500,000 for Khatun’s treatment. But the incident has shocked Birgunj locals. Amar Bahadur Gautam, chair of the Association of Guardians, condemned the attack. “The crime perpetrated upon an innocent teenager has troubled us deeply,” said Gautam. “We are worried about where our society is headed.”","Published at : September 7, 2019",Parsa,Bhusan Yadav						 &
Local units in Dhanusha perform poorly as they fail to exercise their powers,"Service seekers across all local units in Dhanusa have the same complaint: the local bodies have failed to execute their powers and authorities granted by the new constitution of the country.The constitution promulgated in 2015 has delegated 22 different powers and authorities to the local unit. Authorities have been given the power to execute works regarding health, education, agriculture, livestock, social security, development activities, among others.But the locals have seen little progress in any of the sectors mentioned above since the local representatives came to office. “We had hoped that they (people’s representatives) would work effectively and efficiently for the people by exercising their powers and authorities. But the local bodies have failed to live up to our expectations,” said Bishnu Kanta Mishra, a local of Aurahi in Dhanusha. “The local units are good only at collecting tax and carrying out infrastructure development activities. They have so far ignored health, education and agriculture sectors,” he said.Most of the local bodies have been criticised for their failure to allocate budget to community schools for scholarships, midday meals and textbooks, despite the new academic session starting four months ago. Hansapur Municipality in Dhanusha has a notorious record when it comes to budget implementation—last fiscal year Rs 9.4 million was allocated for the midday meal programme for around 5,600 students of 30 community schools, but the entire budget was frozen.The health sector also showed poor results in the municipality. The local bodies could not hire health officials, procure medicines and other necessary equipment, or even provide salaries to the health workers. According to the health workers of Sahidnagar Municipality, they have not received their salaries for the past five months.Mayor Udaya Kumar Yadav said the health workers’ salaries could not be provided as the budget issued under the heading was insufficient. He said, “We will clear the health workers’ salaries within a month.”There are 58 health workers working at nine different health facilities in the municipality.Phulgen Mandal, in-charge of Paterwa Health Post in Sahidnagar, said that the budget meant to appoint auxiliary health workers and auxiliary nurse midwives has remained frozen in the last two fiscal years. “There is a shortage of health officials but the municipality has not hired auxiliary health workers and auxiliary nurse midwife for the past two years,” said Mandal, admitting that the health post could not provide quality service to the people due to the lack of health employees.The locals claim that the people’s representatives prioritised only infrastructure development ignoring other important sectors. “They do not give due importance to the health and education sectors. As a result, the locals are deprived of health and education facilities,” said Sanjaya Kumar Jha of Janakpurdham.The lack of will power and knowledge about their jurisdiction among the elected representatives, process-oriented administration and corruption are the major hurdles behind the ineffective service delivery in the local bodies, believe locals.“The elected representatives should be provided training regarding the jurisdiction of the local body. The concerned political parties have to provide training to the representatives elected from their parties. But nobody does that,” said Ramchandra Jha, former local development minister and culture expert. “The local units that were without elected representatives for 20 years have now suddenly got more rights but they don’t know how to exercise those rights,” he said.","Published at : September 6, 2019",Janakpur,Shyam Sundar Shashi
869 houses handed over to windstorm victims of Bara,"The Nepal Army has completed the construction of 869 houses for the windstorm victims of Bara district and handed them over to the local authority.Twenty-eight people were killed, while hundreds of houses were blown away by the catastrophic storm in Bara and Parsa districts on March 31.The federal government had tasked the Army with the responsibility for the construction of houses for the windstorm victims of Pheta, Subarna, Parwanipur, Prasauni, Pachrauta, Mahagadhimai and Kalaiya local units in Bara district. The government allocated Rs 846.87 million to the Army for the construction of 1,453 houses in Bara and Parsa districts.The acting Prime Minister and Defence Minister Ishwar Pokharel handed the detailed documents of the reconstructed houses to Chief Minister of Province 2 Mohammad Lalbabu Raut amidst a function organised in Birgunj on Wednesday. The documents of the newly built houses were then given to chiefs of the respective local bodies. “We now finally have houses. It’s such a relief,” said Haidar Ali of Purainiya in Pheta Rural Municipality. The government allocated a budget to construct 1,453 houses initially but later verified that only 881 houses needed reconstruction. Construction of 12 houses is on hold due to technical issues, according to Army officials.","Published at : September 5, 2019",Bara,Laxmi Sah
Lahan locals call for relocation of waste management centre,"Residents of Ward No 4 in Lahan Municipality, Siraha, have been demanding the waste management centre be relocated from their locality or the garbage be managed scientifically.The agitating locals, who have been voicing their concerns for the past five months, held a gathering on Sunday to plan a fresh protest programme. They warned of stringent protests if the authorities did not heed to their demands.The locals filed a writ petition at the High Court in Janakpur two weeks ago against the municipality’s act of haphazardly disposing of waste. The Rajbiraj bench of the court has scheduled a hearing in the case for Monday.“We are not against using the area as a waste management centre. But the municipality should manage the waste in a scientific way and control pollution. The case is sub-judice in court. The locals will respect the court’s ruling,” said Jitendra Prakash Mahato, a leader of the struggle committee. He said the municipality ignored the agreement on the use of the area as a waste disposal centre.The locals staged demonstrations on Saturday to protest ‘highhandedness’ of people’s representatives, the municipal employees and police. They took out a protest rally that moved around town and later converged into a corner meeting.The protesting locals claimed that the city mayor and other elected representatives suppressed their peaceful agitation by using security personnel and disposed waste forcefully in the centre on Friday.“The authorities misbehaved with the local women, while the latter were protesting against the municipality’s move to manage waste there,” claimed Mahato.The municipality had been using Ward No. 4 as a dumping ground for the past five years. Stating that the unmanaged garbage disposal at the centre pollutes the settlement, the ward residents have been obstructing the municipality from using the area as garbage disposal centre.The municipality collects around 30 tonnes of waste each day. The local body said it spent around Rs10 million annually on the collection and management of waste.An all-party meeting, with the participation of the local people, had decided to use 12 bighas of land on the bank of the Khutti stream in the ward as a waste management centre around five years ago.Through their protest, the locals urged the municipality to immediately resolve the garbage disposal issue as haphazard dumping of waste has put the settlement at high risk of diseases.But Mayor Munni Sah, calling the protest unnecessary, said: “The local body had been using the area for waste disposal with the permission of the locals. Some of the locals unnecessarily politicised the issue,” he added.Sah, however, admitted that the municipality had not adopted ways to scientifically manage the waste. The municipality had formed a seven-member committee two months ago to find an alternative to the current dumping site. But the committee failed to find any headway.","Published at : September 2, 2019",Siraha,Bharat Jargha Magar
Gajendra Narayan Singh Hospital in Rajbiraj being upgraded to a fully-facilitated one,"The Gajendra Narayan Singh Hospital in Rajbiraj is now being upgraded into a fully-facilitated hospital.In the last two months, the hospital— once termed as a ‘refer centre' for its ability to offer only limited health services— has started extending various services including specialist health care to patients. The hospital has filled all nine quotas for medical specialists, enabling it to cater to more patients, according to Dr Chumanlal Das, medical superintendent at the hospital.In the past, health services at the hospital were badly affected due to poor infrastructure and a lack of health workers and facilities. With the upgrade, the hospital now provides specialist services on medicine, surgery, pediatric, anaesthesia, ENT (Ear Nose Throat), orthopaedic, radiology and dentistry. Patients from Saptari until a few months ago had to travel to Biratnagar or Dharan-based hospitals to seek medical attention from specialists.The hospital plans to start an Intensive Care Unit, a dialysis centre and provide CT scan services, said Das. “The flow of patients has increased after the hospital started providing specialist services. People from Saptari now don’t have to travel outside the district to seek treatment,” Das said. The 125-bed hospital receives around 200 to 250 patients in the outpatient department daily, according to Das. The health facility, formerly known as Sagarmatha Zonal Hospital, was renamed as Gajendra Narayan Singh Sagarmatha Zonal Hospital seven years ago. In the running fiscal year, the Ministry of Health and Population has allocated a budget of Rs 760 million for the hospital’s upgradation.","Published at : September 1, 2019",Rajbiraj,Abadhesh Kumar Jha
"Police rough up a Madhesi man yet again. This time, it’s on video","At a time when the Nepal Police is promoting its ‘Police, my friend’ campaign, a video of several police personnel manhandling a Madhesi man has prompted outrage on social platforms, as Nepalis criticise the heavy-handedness of the police while dealing with the public, especially Madhesis and Tharus in the southern plains.According to Ghanashyam Mishra, a journalist who filmed the video, the police roughed up Sushil Karna, a social campaigner, after summoning him to the Janaki police station at the Janaki Temple in Janakpur. Karna had previously confronted police personnel for beating a coconut vendor while clearing the temple premises. Police had then asked him to present himself at the police station, said Mishra. “Karna then called some of his friends, including me and Rastriya Janata Party spokesperson Krishna Singh, fearing the police might do something wrong,” Mishra told the Post in a phone interview on Friday. When Mishra arrived at the police station, police personnel and Karna were in the midst of a heated discussion, when all of a sudden an officer slapped Karna. The situation quickly escalated and Mishra began to record the video.In the video, a group of police personnel can be seen pushing and pulling on Karna, while his friends attempt to shield him from the police.Mishra and Singh called Superintendent of Police Shekhar Khanal and Chief District Officer Pradip Raj Kandel, prompting the police to recall the officer, Tourist Police Assistant Sub-Inspector Birendra Yadav, to the district police office.Yadav was asked to apologise to Karna. The incident is just one instance of police highhandedness in the Tarai, which has been criticised time and again by human rights organisations. According to a recent study carried out in various prisons across the country, detainees from ethnic communities in the Tarai reported undergoing more torture and misbehaviour at the hands of the police.In July, a Madhesi man was shot dead by the police in a protest in Sarlahi, marking one more instance of police quickly resorting to live ammunition when dealing with unrest in the Tarai.In August last year, Ram Manohar Yadav was arrested from Gulariya, in Bardiya, for displaying black flags in protest against Deputy Prime Minister Upendra Yadav. Ten days later, Yadav’s family was told that he had died in police custody. While police maintained that Yadav had pre-existing health conditions that led to his death, his family, friends and rights activists blamed mistreatment in prison. Yadav’s wife Sunita has alleged that her husband was tortured to death. The autopsy report was never made public.These instances have led to a mass outpouring of criticism against the police, prompting the authorities to provide assurances of better behaviour. Karna’s treatment, however, does not show much improvement in the police’s behaviour, a fact that was pointed out by many on social media.“What’s happening (here) Nepal Police?” one Twitter user wrote. “People are losing faith in you. Why is the police becoming so corrupt? Isn’t it the duty of the police to protect the people? Isn’t it a crime to manhandle a person after calling them to the police station? We have to fear the police when one must feel a sense of security! It’s time the police are aware.”Vijay Kant Karn, a political analyst, blames the current government and its disregard for the human rights of citizens for the police’s behaviour.“This incident is just one of many that occur every day in the Madhes,” he said. “The police in the Madhes act like occupation forces and in most instances, treat the general people as subjects, not citizens.”That this incident involved a tourist police does not bode well for Visit Nepal 2020 either, said Manish Jha, the national tourism campaign’s coordinator for Province 2.“If unchecked, incidents like these will discourage tourists from coming to the province, especially to the Janaki Temple, which is one of the major attractions for tourists from various nations,” said Jha.The outrage over Karna’s treatment has prompted the Dhanusha District Police Office to issue a press statement, saying departmental action will be taken against any police personnel found guilty in the altercation.According to Chandra Kishore, a journalist, police’s activities in the Madhes has always been of an oppressive nature.“There are a lot of incidents like this one that occurs in the Madhes, but this one is different because there is video evidence of police brutality,” said Kishore. “As Karna had visual evidence of their wrongdoing, the police became agitated and tried to harass him in the hopes of inducing fear.”","Published at : August 30, 2019",Kathmandu,Samuel Chhetri
Local unit constructing its office building without meeting due legal process,"An individual can construct a house or any other structures only after the local unit approves its design. However, a rural municipality in Sarlahi district has been constructing its office building without meeting the due legal process.Chakraghatta Rural Municipality in the southern part of the district has been constructing its two-storey office building near the Dhangra stream without getting the design approved by a technician as required by law. The locals complained that the public building was being constructed carelessly without meeting the building code. “The rural municipality office building is being constructed on the bank of the Dhangra stream, a flood-prone area. The building neither has adhered to building design nor is it earthquake-resilient,” said Ramji Sah, a local resident. According to him, the villagers repeatedly requested the local unit not to construct its office building in the flood-prone area, but the latter paid no heed.Chakraghatta Rural Municipality started construction of the office at the cost of Rs6.5 million by forming a consumers’ committee. The local people claimed the foundation of the under-construction building is also very shaky. “The building is being constructed on a weak foundation. It can collapse anytime,” said Jawahar Prasad Chaudhary, demanding a halt to construction until the due process is followed.Basoda Devi, the deputy chief of the local body, added that the office building was being constructed against the decision of rural municipality’s meeting. She claimed the meeting held two years earlier decided to construct a building in a different location. “The decisions of the meeting are not implemented. I have been sidelined as I urged to move forward by following the existing legal provisions,” said the deputy chief, asserting that the chief of the local body constructed the building violating the legal procedure. Bikram Yadav, chief of the rural municipality, admitted to constructing the office building without adhering to the design rules as required. “House and building construction standards have not been prepared yet. So we started the construction without approval,” said Yadav.","Published at : August 30, 2019",Sarlahi,Om Prakash Thakur
Province 2 government launches ‘green drive’ to prevent natural disasters,"With the objective to expand forest area from existing four percent to 40 percent, the Province 2 government has initiated a ‘green campaign’ in all eight districts of the province.Provincial Ministry of Industry, Forest, Environment and Tourism launched the campaign by mobilising the division forest office in each district to organise a plantation drive. The drive formally commenced with plantation programmes from Sagarnath Forest Development Project of Sarlahi district on Saturday. Chief Minister Mohammad Lalbabu Raut attended the function.“Province 2 is quite vulnerable to various natural disasters like floods, drought, storms and cold waves. Therefore, trees are important to maintain an ecological balance and control natural calamities,” said Suresh Mandal, the State Minister for Industry, Forest, Environment and Tourism. “Province 2 has high population density, the second highest after Province 3, but forest cover is meagre. The green campaign aims to change that,” he added.Province 2 is home to 5.4 million people according to the national census, 2011. According to the ministry, samplings of various tree species were planted in around 155 hectares of land on the first day of the plantation drive. The tree plantation programme will continue till September 6.According to Mandal, saplings of tik, sal, masala, sakhuwa, magahi, etc, have been planted in around 20 hectares of land in Sagarnath Forest Development Project, a disputed forest area which is claimed by both the federal and provincial governments. The provincial government challenged the central government’s move to merge the forest project with the Timber Corporation of Nepal at the Supreme Court in August first week.The provincial government aims to plant 350,000 saplings in various districts of the province this year. Ministry of Industry, Forest, Environment and Tourism said that it would clear the encroached forest areas and plant trees.","Published at : August 27, 2019",Janakpur,Ajit Tiwari
Cases of irregularities in driver’s license distribution in Birgunj on the rise,"A team from the Parsa District Police Office on Tuesday nabbed four individuals from a driving trial centre at Prasaunibirta in Birgunj. They were nabbed for illicitly demanding money from people sitting for driving tests, promising to facilitate them in obtaining a driver’s license even if they fail the exams, according to DSP Ananta Ram Sharma.Among the nabbed were Rajkumar Sah and Amlesh Prasad Sah from Bindabasini Rural Municipality; Satarohan Sah from Prasauni Rural Municipality; and Samarthan Neuapane from Hetauda Sub-metropolis.The police also confiscated Rs 92,000 and some documents from the detainees. A trial was underway at the centre the day they were arrested. On April 26, a team from the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority arrested two middlemen from the Office of Transportation Driving License Certificate with bribe money. The duo, Roshan Rauniyar and Sunil Yadav, had promised its clients that they would “arrange” driving license for them at Rs 31,000 each. The anti-graft body also charged Badri Dahal of the License bureau for his involvement in the irregularity.Though the office had adopted strict measures after these incidents, cases of irregularities have far from declined, with middlemen active once again. According to sources from the office, two among the four middlemen who were nabbed on Tuesday have ‘good relations’ with officials at the license department. The middlemen were nabbed with the certificates of 17 individuals who were attending the trial. Those 17 people had failed the written exams, according to the source.The in-charge of the trial centre Bhola Sah admitted that there are irregularities in license distribution, but denied that the centre had any connection with those middlemen. “We are aware that the number of middlemen is on the rise, but we don’t have any connection with them,” Sah said.However, Sushil Kumar Sah, recently appointed chief of the Transportation Management Office’s driving license department, said he is unaware of the irregularities. “I am investigating it,” said Sah. “If there are irregularities, they will be contained.”","Published at : August 24, 2019",Birgunj,Bhusan Yadav
"Farmers in Tirahut, Saptari worry after paddy fields dried up","The once green rice fields are now covered with wilted crops, says Rajendra Yadav, a farmer from Tirahut Rural Municipality in Saptari district.“We didn’t get enough rain this season. I lost all paddy saplings due to a shortage of water,” Yadav said.Farmers in Tirahut depend on monsoon rains or underground water for paddy plantation since there is no irrigation facility. To mitigate the farmers’ woes, the rural municipal office purchased deep boring machines for Rs 13 million in the fiscal year 2017-18 and 2018-19. However, they have been of little help to the farmers.Manoj Kumar Yadav, chairman of Tirahut Ward No 4, said that the boring machines were yet to be distributed.“We were told that the municipal office had purchased deep boring machines at Rs 13 million to irrigate the fields. The office hasn’t distributed them yet,” he said.The boring machines have been kept at local police posts for safekeeping.“The machines have been stored at two police posts in Lohajara and Trikol. The municipal office plans to put them to use this fiscal year,” said Hemanta Kumar Baharkher, chairman of the rural municipality.Meanwhile, paddy fields in the rural municipality have started developing cracks due to insufficient rainfall.“The crops are also being blighted by diseases,” said Manoj Kumar.According to the records kept by the district office, there are around 70,000 hectares of cultivable land in Saptari, and nearly 60 per cent of the area depends on rainwater for farming. Bhogananda Mahatman, chairman of Tirahut Ward No 3, said that he received 20 deep boring machines from the municipal office only a week ago.“We have been unable to distribute the machines because they cannot fulfil the needs of all farmers. We will begin distributing the machines after we get more machines,” said Mahatman.There’s no exact data on how many boring machines the office of Tirahut Rural Municipality has purchased so far. Both the chief administrative officer and the accountant of the office were unavailable when the Post tried to contact them for comments.Baharkher said that he would direct the respective ward chairmen to take stock of the situation and distribute boring machines on a priority basis.“Our fields are drying up and the machines lie unused. The local government has invested a lot of money to procure those machines. They should be used,” said Bhuneshwor Yadav, a local farmer.","Published at : August 23, 2019",Rajbiraj,Abadhesh Kumar Jha
Army opens fire to drive elephants away in Parsa,"The Nepal Army on Tuesday night fired 50 rounds of warning shots into the air to drive away a herd of elephants in the Pathalaiya-Amlekhgunj road stretch. The army from the Siddhibox Battalion opened fire after the herd tried to turn over a truck transporting rice from Hetauda to Pathalaiya. The elephants, which had escaped from the Parsa National Park, tried to steal rice from the truck, said Ashok Ram, information officer at the park. The incident obstructed the highway for a couple of hours. The elephants later returned to their habitat in the park.The herd included 27 pachyderms. One army personnel sustained an injury while driving the elephants away. Meanwhile, two elephants that have been spreading terror in Sarlahi for the last six months have moved to the Halkhoriya area in Parsa National Park. This phenomenon of elephants travelling to the highway, however, is not new. This year, the elephants took longer to show up along the highway, according to Ram. Usually, the elephants travel across the roads to Sarlahi in mid-June.The movement of the elephants this year was interrupted by the ongoing Motihari-Raxaul-Amlekhgunj oil pipeline construction, Ram said. Likewise, the Nijgadh-Kathmandu fast track is also under construction near the elephants’ habitat.","Published at : August 22, 2019",Parsa,Shankar Acharya
Illegal extraction from Mahottari riverbeds continues,"Even though the government imposed a three-month ban on the excavation of sand and stones from the rivers in Mahottari effective for three months until mid-August, the extraction of resources has not stopped.The illegal business is most apparent in the Khayermara and Madaha rivers, in wards 10 and 11 of Bardibas Municipality, where hundreds of tractors of river resources are being smuggled daily.The excavation has only increased, despite the government ban, locals say, accusing the local units and representatives of inaction in the face of illegal excavation that has put the whole village of Khayermar at risk.The ban on the excavation of aggregate and boulders from the Highway up to the Chure area came in line with the provisions of the President Chure Conservation Act. The ban, however, is clearly not being followed: it’s a common site that dozens of tractors are lined up along the river banks, loaded with sand and boulders.“A single person owns as many as four tractors and one tractor can make seven round-trips,” said a labourer who loads the tractor on condition of anonymity. “All of the dozens of tractors are owned by seven to eight contractors.”The two prominent rivers—Khayermara and Madaha—that cut through the district inflicted heavy damage this monsoon, deluging the villages and forests. Locals say the illegal mining would only exacerbate the damage. Local units and stakeholders have remained suspiciously mum about the illegal activity.Locals accuse the representatives and members of local units of being involved in the unlawful activity.One tractor owner the Post talked to at Madaha River claimed that he was encouraged by a local people’s representative to mine the river.Assistant Sub-inspector Shambhu Prasad Sah, who is in charge of the Khayermara Police Post, echoed the tractor owner. “We have tried to stop illegal mining several times,” said Sah. “We tried to take the tractors under control, but the owners said the mining was for private use, as recommended by the ward chairs.”Dhanlal Shrestha, the ward 10 chairman, admitted to having suggested that needy residents could earn through the mining of river resources.“The locals pleaded that they needed to extract some sand and boulders from the river to build houses and fill the embankments,” Shrestha said. “We recommended that they extract but only the essential quantity.”Ward-11 chief Dhan Raj Lama, however, denied that his office had given the permission to extract sand. Instead, Lama alleged that the police had done nothing to control the illegal activity. “Police have paid no attention to the illicit activities,” Lama said.Lama contradicted himself when he said, “We did grant the permission to a certain few people who said they needed sand and pebbles to save their house. But only what is needed. It should be inspected whether they have taken away more than what was necessary.”Mayor of Bardibas Municipality Bidur Kumar Karki said he was unaware of all that is happening at the two rivers. “The ward cannot recommend the illegal activity, despite what people ask for,” Karki said. “We will supervise and take action immediately in coordination with the District Coordination Committee.”Suresh Prasad Singh, the Coordination Committee chairman, said the committee had not received any information even as the illegal operations had continued for weeks. “No local unit informed us about the breach of law,” Singh said. “We will inspect the sites and take immediate action.”","Published at : August 18, 2019",Mahottari,Sunita Baral
Wild elephants wreak havoc in Sarlahi again,"Wild elephants have been wreaking havoc in Hariwon and Lalbandi areas of Sarlahi district for the past couple of days. The tuskers pulled down houses and destroyed crops.The residents of Hariwon, Lalbandi and Ishworpur municipalities have been living in constant fear since the jumbos first entered the settlements and wreaked havoc in December last year. Though there was a break in tusker menace for the past two months, the jumbos again started terrorising the locals from Friday. Two wild elephants entered the Ganesh Chowk area of Hariwon-4 on Friday night and destroyed four houses. The houses belonging to Gopi Pandit, Mustakhim Lahari, Phiroj Mikarani and Khursed Ansari were destroyed in elephants’ attack, said police.There were no casualties as local residents managed to flee on time. The tuskers dismantled the wooden houses and ate as well as destroyed the food grains stored there.The elephants tore down a house at Nawalpur of Lalbandi-1 on Friday morning. The house belonging to Ramchandra Mahato was destroyed by the tuskers. According to the locals, the elephants devoured paddy, wheat and other food grains stored in the house.According to local residents, the elephants stay in the forests nearby during the day and enter the settlements usually at night. The victims complained that the authorities concerned paid no heed even though they have faced elephant attacks for months. Conservationists tranquilised one of the marauding elephants a few weeks ago and installed a radio collar in their bid to track the beast. That elephant was found dead in Laxminiya forest of Mahottari district a few days ago.“We human beings have encroached on the habitat of elephants and planted crops. The tuskers sometimes enter human settlements in search of food,” said Madhav Prasad Dev, chief of the Division Forest Office in Sarlahi. According to him, the forest officials and security personnel cannot control the elephants. “We can just chase the elephants away from the settlements. Police personnel and forest officials drove away the elephants on Friday night,” said Dev.","Published at : August 17, 2019",Sarlahi,Om Prakash Thakur
Overcrowding of Saptari Prison puts inmates at risk of contagious diseases,"Saptari Prison in Rajbiraj currently has three times its capacity of inmates. The prison’s overcrowding often leads to outbreaks of contagious diseases with many inmates falling ill and some succumbing to illnesses for lack of timely and proper medical treatment. “Six inmates have died in the past one and a half years due to various illnesses,” said Satya Narayan Yadav, acting chief at the prison. “Just this Wednesday, Rabi Marik Yadav, a high blood pressure patient, died.”Dr Ranjit Kumar Jha at Gajendra Narayan Singh Hospital in Rajbiraj said that the health situation at Saptari Prison is pitiable. “I have visited the prison many times to provide health check ups to the inmates. Frequent outbreak of viral flu is a major health challenge at the prison,” said Jha. According to him, the chances of transmission of infectious diseases are high in the prison because of the overcrowding.“The old and dilapidated prison building has a capacity to house 125 prisoners. However, we currently have 250 inmates including one minor and 17 women,” Acting chief Yadav said.According to him, the prison management has informed the local, provincial and central authorities on the issue, but it has yet to hear from them. The prison administration admits that the facility lacks enough water, toilets and rooms for the inmates. Surendra Paudel, the chief district officer of Saptari, said despite the overcrowding, the local administration has been providing timely treatment to the prisoners. “A health team was immediately deployed when many inmates were taken ill by viral fever a few days ago,” he said. The prison has five bighas of land but around two bighas of land has been encroached upon by squatters. “We have to manage a large number of prisoners in this dilapidated building. The infrastructure and the resources we have cannot provide a healthy environment for prisoners,” said Yadav. Amidst talks of turning prisons into reform centres where inmates can live in healthy conditions, the Saptari Prison has taken a different turn, says Yadav. “We haven’t been able to address the various demands raised by the inmates to reform the prison. We don’t have the budget for that,” he said. Yadav, a senior auxiliary health worker, was given the responsibility of the acting chief two years ago when the then prison chief Krishna Prasad Dahal was detained by the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority on graft charge.“Being a jailer is not my area of expertise but a shortage of staff at the prison has put this additional responsibility on me,” Yadav said. “I haven’t been able to dedicate myself to providing health services to inmates here.” Paudel says despite their repeated requests, the Department of Prison Management still hasn’t deployed a jailer. “The arrangement with Yadav is temporary,” he said.","Published at : August 16, 2019",Rajbiraj,Abdhesh Kumar Jha
Tree plantation drive launched to recover encroached forestland,"Sabaiya Collaborative Forest Management Group has planted saplings in 27 hectares of forestland in Parsa by evicting encroachers.The group, in collaboration with Tarai Chure Protection Programme, Collaborative Forest Management Committee and the Division Forest Office, has planted 22,000 saplings of Khair, Masala, Tik, Simal, Saisau and Jamun among other trees on the forestland. A total of Rs 2.7 million was spent on the plantation drive.According to the forest office, around 381 hectares of forestland have been encroached by individuals who claim to be flood and landless victims in Parsa. Lalan Sah, chairman of the Collaborative Forest Management Committee, said that they have reclaimed the forestland by raising awareness among the local population about the importance of forest conservation. “We have fenced the area and deployed guards to protect the recently planted tree saplings,” Sah said. However, one of the employees at the forest office said they have not been able to clear the forestland, as some of the encroachers have “political connections.”Sabaiya Collaborative Forest, which covers 3,088.69 hectares of forestland, was established 15 years ago. Ahamad Ansari, planning chief at the district office, said the office has also been making efforts to control poaching activities in the forestland and to conserve the area. “We have also formed a fire line around the forest to prevent wildfires from spreading,” said Ansari.","Published at : August 15, 2019",Birgunj,Bhusan Yadav
Embankments destroyed in floods in Province 2 are being filled with sandbags that are not strong enough to contain water,"The mid-July floods brought on havoc across the Tarai. In the most-affected districts of Rautahat, Sarlahi, Mahottari, Dhanusha and Sarlahi, rain-swollen rivers tore through embankments and engulfed settlements, displacing hundreds of households, destroying hundreds of hectares of agricultural lands and killing around a dozen people.The decades-old embankments built across Bagmati, Bakaiya, Ratu and Kamala Rivers were not strong enough to contain the raging waters of the rivers. And as soon as the flood waters receded, the local units rushed to spend money out of state coffers to rebuild the embankments, but without much thought, locals say.Local units and the Office of Water Induced Disasters (WIDC) hastily started filling the broken embankments with sandbags. The move, however, has been criticised not only by the survivors but even by government technicians, who say that the efforts are unsustainable. Most of the embankments that were eroded are as old as 40 years. Locals and technicians say the structures were sub-par and had flawed designs, even when they were built. The locals have been calling it out and demanding the structures be rebuilt entirely. But the local units have been continuing with the age-old method, like they did the previous years, saying they lack the funds for a complete overhaul.Devanand Mahto, mayor of the Barahathawa Municipality in Sarlahi, said that neither the WIDC nor the People’s Embankment Programme has provided any support even after repeated calls for attention.Last year, the Barahathawa Municipality decided to go its own way to contain the rivers, constructing two “breakers”, spending Rs 6 million. “That was what we could do,” Mahto said. But only two breakers can’t contain a river, so the erosion continues. “We can do only so much with the municipality’s budget,” Mahto added. “We informed the Minister of Water Resources as well but nothing significant has been done so far.”Even though the floods have settled, the rivers have continued to erode arable fields. Short of options, locals too have joined efforts of local units and WIDC to contain the water using sandbags to fill the embankments. With these lackadaisical measures, it is sure that the floods will create the same havoc next year.Ratna Bahadur Giri, chief of ward number 1 in Barahathawa Municipality, said that dozens of settlements in his municipality and Ramnagar Rural Municipality are at immediate risk of floods caused by erosion. “The river has already destroyed crops planted in hundreds of hectares of land,” Giri said. “If not contained, it will sure destroy more and also inundate dozens of settlements.” Mayor Mahto said that his office had called the attention of Disaster Management Committee (DMC) after requests to WIDC and People’s Embankment Programme went unheeded. A team led by Chief District Officer of Sarlahi Mohan Bahadur GC, who also chairs the DMC, and the chief of WIDC Bara, Rajkumar Shrivastav, came for inspection. CDO GC called a team of technicians and directed them to study the crisis. And that is all that has happened thus far.Shrivastav has not been picking calls anymore, Mahto said. “It’s the same story every year,” Mahto added.The Post reached out to CDO GC who had been to the Bagmati River for inspection. “A long-term solution requires a heavy budget, beyond our capacity,” GC told the Post. “But we have been making efforts towards that. The sustainable solution may take some time, but the short-term efforts to contain the water are currently ongoing.” The short-term efforts GC talks about are the same sub-par efforts to fill the embankments with sandbags and bamboo, which is what is currently happening at several river banks. The floods not only inundate the settlements but also damage motorable bridges and roads. The bridge over Bhabsi River, for instance, was damaged by the floods three years ago. The bridge was repaired but this year again, the bridge is rendered unmotorable.Manoj Kumar Chaudhary, chair of Janakpur Zonal Transportation Entrepreneurs’ Association, said that the floods have rendered several transportation labourers unemployed. “It happens every year but the government never seeks a permanent solution,” Chaudhary said.It is high time there are proper, sustainable measures to curb this yearly problem, said Bishweshwar Yadav, chair of Kamala River Victim’s Coordination Committee in Dhanusha.Bhagwan Jha, chief of Water Resource and Irrigation Development Division Office in Dhanusha, admits the lack of permanent solutions to this perennial problem. “We have however initiated dialogues on plans for permanent solutions,” Jha said, adding that this year’s floods affected several irrigation projects such as Badh Irrigation Project, Amari and Balubaha.In Siraha, the situation is more or less the same. Manohar Kumar Sah, chief of Kamala River Control Project, said that because monsoon is here for another month and a half, the Project has started constructing embankments with sandbags to control floods that has already affected settlements such as Paterwa, Malhaniya, Kharsolwa, Basbit, Belha and Marewa, among others. “For immediate preservation efforts, we have filled the sacs with sand and bound them with ropes to construct embankments,” said Sah. “But this is only a temporary solution, which does not guarantee it controls the raging water.” (Shyam Sundar Sashi in Janakpur and Bharat Jargha Magar in Siraha contributed reporting.)","Published at : August 14, 2019",Kathmandu,Om Prakash Thakur
Most local units in Dhanusha fail to allocate budget meant for community schools,"It has been nearly four months of the new academic session. However, students of most community schools in Dhanusha are yet to receive the amount meant to buy textbooks. The students have also been deprived of scholarship and midday meal. Of the total 18 local bodies in Dhanusha, most of the local units have not allocated budget to community schools for scholarship, midday meal and textbooks. Some schools claimed that the elected representatives in their areas asked for commission to allocate the budget that they are entitled to according to the constitution. Pawan Mandal, headmaster at Tinkauriya Secondary School in Bideha Municipality, said a municipal official solicited bribe to release the budget. Hansapur Municipality has a notorious record when it comes to budget implementation—last fiscal year Rs 9.4 million was allocated for midday meal programme for around 5,600 students of 30 community schools, but the entire budget was frozen, as the municipality failed to issue the budget on time. The students of various community schools were also deprived of the scholarship scheme last year.Ramgyan Mandal, mayor of Hansapur Municipality, admitted to his office’s failure to release the budget for community schools in the last fiscal year due to the shortage of staff. “We will release the budget for this year at any cost,” Mandal said. Teachers, guardians and other stakeholders have expressed their dissatisfaction with the elected representatives for failing to effectively implement the budget.“The people’s representatives are not concerned about the state of community schools in local units. Why don’t they release the budget for scholarships, midday meals and textbooks on time?” said Ramsnehi Yadav, the district chief of Nepal Teacher Association. “Their incompetence is affecting students at community schools who rely on these provisions.”The government has launched various programmes, such as midday meal and scholarships, to check the alarming dropout rate in Dhanusha. But the programmes have not been implemented effectively due to the local units’ failure to allocate the budget on time. According to the data available at the District Education Unit in Dhanusha, 67,623 students were enrolled in grades one to three in the last academic session, while the number of students from grades 9 and 10 stood at just 20,601. “One of the reasons for such a high dropout rate is the deprivation of various facilities like midday meal, scholarship and textbook purchase expense,” said Shailendra Mallik, a local teacher.","Published at : August 13, 2019",Janakpur,Shyamsundar Shashi
Speaker of Province 2 begins process to resolve long standing issue of name and capital of the province,"The Speaker of the Provincial Assembly has finally begun the parliamentary process to resolve the longstanding issue of giving the province a name and a capital city. Speaker Saroj Kumar Yadav issued a notice on Sunday urging the local government to register a proposal regarding the name and capital of the province. The issued deadline to register the proposal/s is from August 11 to 22. The Speaker issued the notice by amending the provincial assembly working procedure. In accordance with the procedure, any member of the provincial assembly can register a proposal with the support of at least two other members of the legislative body.Due to intra- and inter-party disputes regarding the name and capital of the province, the provincial government could not submit a proposal to resolve the longstanding issue. The ruling Nepal Samajbadi Party and Rastriya Janata Party Nepal want to name province 2 as Madhes Province; however, Nepal Communist Party and Nepali Congress want to name Province 2 as Mithila Province. Even the provincial assembly members of the same party are divided on the issue. There is also a sharp division among lawmakers on the issue of choosing a capital; they don’t know whether to make Janakpur—which is currently the temporary capital—the permanent capital or shift the provincial headquarters to Birgunj. In accordance to the constitution, the Provincial Assembly has the authority to decide the name and capital of the province by two-thirds majority.","Published at : August 13, 2019",Dhanusha,Santosh Singh
Sarlahi area police office building in a state of disrepair,"Thursday was a stormy day in Sarlahi. All the district’s residents were indoors, except for the police personnel of Harkathawa Police Office. The district experiences erratic wind during this time of the year.When a violent squall struck Sarlahi on Thursday, the security personnel stationed at Harkathawa Area Police Office rushed outdoors, lest their office building—a rickety one-and-half storey structure—collapsed. The officers ran to the nearby waiting shed and waited out the storm. The office building of Harkthawa Area Police Office was constructed in 1990, the year multi-party democracy was reinstated in the country. In 2001, the building was bombed by the Maoist rebels. The explosion had rendered the building uninhabitable. But the area police office continued to operate from the same building after carrying out some repair works. For over seven years, the building stood in a dilapidated state, until it was restored in 2008—two years after the Maoists joined mainstream politics.One more storey was added to the building to create more rooms so that it could accommodate more occupants. But the building restoration work was far from satisfactory, evinced frequently during stormy days like Thursday. The upper floor of the building leaks during the rainy season and the entire structure sways even during mild storms, according to Sub-inspector of Police Mohan Katuwal.“On Thursday, the storm set in right from the morning and the building moved from side to side. There was no way we could stay inside,” Katuwal said.“There have been several instances when we had to flee during the night.”The Harkathawa Police Office’s scope of jurisdiction is unevenly spread across Dhanakaul Rural Municipality, Godauta Municipality and Basabariya Rural Municipality. It covers the widest area in the district and therefore has a heavy responsibility of enforcing law and order.But with the sorry state of the area police office building, Katuwal said the officers were unable to get a good night’s sleep and that they feel weighed down and overworked, both mentally and physically. “This shows mostly during disasters, like the recent floods,” Katuwal said. “While we are responsible for providing security to the people, we ourselves are insecure.” Superintendent of Police Gopal Chandra Bhattarai at the District Police Office said the building design of the area police office is not right, what with its asymmetrical rooms, uncomfortable staircase and weak structural integrity. A few years ago, a police constable had died after falling off the building’s terrace.“When the building was bombed in 2001, the locals hastily repaired it because they did not want the police office to move out from their neighbourhood,” Bhattarai said. “When the building was restored in 2008, no one bothered to fix the flaws in the building design.”","Published at : August 12, 2019",Sarlahi,Om Prakash Thakur
Flood-threatened Sarlahi villagers say temporary embankment will not stave off bank erosion,"Barhatawa Municipality in Sarlahi has been constructing a temporary embankment by using sandbags to stop bank erosion of Bagmati River. However, the temporary solution is proving to be of little use, as the river continues to erode farmlands in Kharsal Ghat after it changed its course towards Hajariya during the recent floods. Barhathawa Mayor Devanada Mahato said that the rain-swollen river has been continuously eroding the river banks and that temporary embankment may not be able to hold the river any longer. Ratna Bahadur Giri, ward chairman of Barhathawa, said that ward numbers 1, 3, 14 and 15 of the municipality, including dozens of settlements of Basbariya and Ramnagar rural municipalities, face the threat of possible inundation.With possible inundation looming large and the concerned authorities only finding ‘temporary’ solutions, locals find themselves at a loss. “We had requested the Water Induced Disaster Prevention Office to take measures to control bank erosion but they paid no heed to us. Now the river is expanding its reach and the solution they have come up with is not going to help,” said Giri. In the last month alone, hundreds of bighas of farmlands, where farmers had cultivated paddy, sugarcane, turmeric and bananas, were eroded by the river. The area was inspected by a team of government officials on Wednesday evening. After the inspection, the team has decided to call a technical team from the Water Induced Disaster Prevention Office to return the course of the river in its original place. Chief District Officer Mohan Bahadur GC admitted that the temporary embankment cannot minimise flooding threat in the area. “The technical team will suggest a permanent solution to this problem,” said GC.","Published at : August 9, 2019",Sarlahi,Om Prakash Thakur
"In Province 2, people are getting electrocuted to death—at a rate of one every day","In January, a bus carrying 35 people was returning from a marriage ceremony when it touched a high tension wire hanging off a pole in Sabaila, Dhanusha. The current transmitted to the bus, electrocuting six passengers to death and leaving several others injured and unconscious. That same week, in Kuwarampur, Janakpur, two people died when they were attempting to traverse an under-construction section of the road and their feet touched a naked wire on the ground. In the last fiscal year alone, 527 people in Province 2 died after being electrocuted, according to Provincial Police Office Spokesperson DSP Gyan Kumar Mahato. Electricity leakages, naked high-voltage wires, and fluctuating voltage corrupting electrical appliances are behind these deaths, said Mahato. Locals blame the Nepal Electricity Authority for the deaths. In Sabaila and Kuwarampur, locals had filed reports with the Nepal Electricity Authority regarding the loose wires. It was only after people started dying did the authority finally take heed of the complaints and took care of the live wires. Naked wires are fairly common across Province 2, especially in Dhanusha and Janakpur, say locals. Only last year, in July 23, two people—36-year-old Narendra Chaudhary and 14-year-old Sunita Mandal—were electrocuted when they switched on their electric lamps at home in Basantapur of Haripurwa Municipality in Sarlahi. An exceedingly high-voltage current was the reason for their deaths. Diplal Raya, ward chairman of Kabilasi Municipality-1, Sarlahi, said that loose cables hanging from utility poles are another common sight in the village. “A majority of these utility poles were installed around two decades ago. The lack of upkeep of these poles has led to many accidents here,” said Raya. “The poles are in immediate need of either replacement or repair.” Matrika Yadav, the federal industry, commerce and supplies minister, is from Dhanusha and said he is well aware of the problem in his constituency. “We are investigating as to why there are wires hanging from electricity poles in many places,” Yadav said at a public programme after the Sabaila incident. “Many electricity poles stand in poor condition.” It’s been over six months since Yadav made those statements, but little has been done so far. However, Pradeep Kandel, chief district officer of Dhanusha, said that he has employed three engineers to survey Dhanusha’s electric supply. “Electricity wires are unmanaged and accidents are on the rise,” Kandel said. “The Nepal Electricity Authority has been ordered to replace old poles and manage the wiring.” A year ago, two people in Haripurwa Municipality in Sarlahi were electrocuted after a high tension wire from a utility pole snapped and fell onto the roof of a house. The victims’ families received compensation from the Nepal Electricity Authority only after six months.According to the Nepal Electricity Authority in Janakpur, it provides Rs 200,000 in compensation to victims’ families and also bears the medical expenses of victims in case of injuries. According to Jitendra Sonal, Province 2 minister for physical infrastructure, the Nepal Electricity Authority is a federal entity and the provincial government has little authority over it. “We have been asking the government and the electricity authority to resolve the problem of unmanaged wires and utility poles,” said Sonal. “We will not tolerate any negligence, as their carelessness has already taken far too many lives."" About six months ago, an irate Shrawan Kumar Dev, a Janakpur local, took to Facebook to vent his frustration about sub-par electricity services in Janakpur. Dev said that electricity supply was intermittent with constant fluctuations in power, as many as a dozen times in an hour. “I have not been able to sleep a wink in Janakpur for the past six months, thanks to the city’s electricity service,” Dev wrote in the post. “Why does nobody care? The city is home to the chief minister and ministers and still the electricity service is terrible.”","Published at : August 9, 2019",Janakpur,Ajit Tiwari
Siraha flood victims complain of discrepancies in relief distribution,"On Monday, upon learning about the local unit’s relief distribution drive, Amirika Devi Yadav rushed to the nearby Janata Secondary School, in Ward 4 of Aurahi Rural Municipality. Yadav stood in line in the scorching midday heat for hours only to return empty-handed. After hours of waiting, she was informed that she was not on the roster of flood victims. Illiterate Yadav asked others to look for her name on the list but they too couldn’t find her name. “The ward chair and police had noted my name two days after the flood,” said Yadav, who has been taking shelter at her neighbour’s house for three weeks since the floods destroyed her house. “But when I went to receive the relief material, the officials said my name was not on the list.”Several other victims in Ward-4 of Aurahi Rural Municipality the Post talked to had similar experiences at the distribution drive. On Monday, more than 25 victims returned home with nothing. The same day, agitated victims gathered outside the ward office, protesting against corrupt practices in relief distribution. The victims alleged the local representatives of fraud, of listing their kith and kin on the roster even though they were not affected by the floods. Several municipalities in Siraha were deluged with floodwater from Kamala River. According to District Administration Office, Siraha, a total of 4,005 houses were destroyed by the flood, which had displaced 7,771 households, killing five people. Days after the disaster, the District Disaster Management Committee had decided to appoint representatives from the police, Red Cross, ward offices and local political leaders to collect the names of the victims. But the team was dominated by political leaders and ward chairs, locals say. “The relief material was probably for victims like us who have nothing; instead it has been distributed among those who have plenty,” said Rajkumar Raut Kurmi, a local rights activist. “In some cases, there have been political favours. Extending political favours in relief distribution is morally wrong.” Locals of Sakhuwanankarati Rural Municipality, where about 400 families were affected, also complained about discrepancies in relief distribution in their municipality.After widespread complaints, the rural municipality has formed a committee, including deputy chair of the rural municipality, and representatives from Red Cross and the media to monitor relief distribution.Sidhhartha Yadav, chief of the municipality, said that his office has received written complaints. “We will investigate whether there have been shortcomings in the process of collecting names,” said Yadav. “We will make the relief material available to those whose names are missing from the record. None of the actual victims will be left out from receiving the material.”The provincial government has allocated 25 kg of rice, four kgs of lentil, one mat, one mosquito net, one litre of cooking oil, and two pieces of soaps each to affected families. Red Cross Society has allocated 30 kgs of rice, 4 kg lentil, a blanket and tent to each household.Chief District Officer Gopal Kumar Adhikari admitted to the discrepancy about data collection. “Yes, we have found some discrepancy in data collection, but we are also correcting it,” he said. “In some cases, even the ward chairs are found to be responsible for the mistake, but we are re-assessing data.”","Published at : August 7, 2019",Siraha,Bharat Jargha Magar
Lingering delay in bridge completion continues to put lives at risk,"People of Gaur, Tikuliya, Banjaraha and Auriaya in Rautahat district have been risking their lives by using boats to cross the Lalbakaiya river every monsoon due to delay in the construction of a bridge. The bridge has been under construction for the past six years.In August 24, 2018, five people were killed when a boat capsized after hitting a pillar of the under-construction bridge. Sunarniya Devi, a 45-year-old local woman of Tikuliya, says she fears for her life every time she crosses the river by boat. “Our farmlands are across Tikuliyaghat, and we have to cross the river to get there. I don’t like using the boat but there is nothing else I can do,” she said.Around 150 people cross the river by boat every day. Residents of Banjaraha, Auriaya, Mathiya, Jokaha, Bairiya, Akolwa and Rampur Khap villages have to cross the river to reach Gaur, the district headquarters of Saptari district.Dr Govinda KC, a senior orthopaedic surgeon who was in Rautahat to conduct health camps in flood-affected areas, said that locals have been affected by the delay in the bridge construction. “The concerned authority should expedite the construction of the bridge and take strong action against the contractor for delaying the project,” said KC, who had also used a boat to cross the river and reach Banjaraha Village a few days ago.Locals claim that the construction of the bridge in Tikuliyaghat is going at a snail’s pace. Bhuwaneshwor Shahi, ward chairman, said that Pappu Constructions, a construction company notorious for grabbing a large number of projects but not completing them on time, has not shown interest to complete the construction on time. “Why hasn’t the government taken action against such contractors?” asked Shahi.Pappu Constructions was awarded the contract four years ago with a completion deadline of July 2017, but the company has barely finished putting up the full structure of the bridge. In the four years, only 65 percent of the bridge’s construction work has been completed.The seven-span bridge will be 225 metres long and 7.2 metres wide after completion. Daroga Prasad, chief at the Division Road Office in Chandranigahapur, said that the bridge can be completed within a year if the construction work gains momentum.During winter, locals used a temporary bamboo bridge to cross the river, but the monsoon flood swept it away. According to Daroga Prasad, they have requested the authorities to extend the deadline of the bridge project. “The deadline for the completion of the bridge project was two years ago. We have asked for an extension,” Prasad said.Surendra Yadav, a site engineer of Pappu Constructions, however, claimed that the construction work of the bridge has gained momentum recently. “We will resume work once the monsoon ends,” said Yadav.","Published at : August 5, 2019",Rautahat,Shiva Puri
Province 2 files writ at Supreme Court against central government’s intervention,"Challenging the central government’s move to merge the Sagarnath Forest Development Project with the Timber Corporation of Nepal, the Province 2 government on Thursday filed a writ petition at the Supreme Court. It has charged the central government with violating the jurisdiction of the provincial government.The Provincial Ministry of Industry, Forest, Environment, and Tourism filed the petition at the apex court demanding an order dismissing the request for a merger.This is arguably the first case filed at the judicial body challenging the jurisdiction exercised by the central government after the country adopted federalism with the promulgation of the new constitution in 2015.A cabinet meeting of the provincial government on March 8 had decided to bring the Forest Development Project—which covers 13,132 hectares of land in Sarlahi, Mahottari and Rautahat districts—under the provincial government. The provincial executive claimed that it had informed the federal government about its decision.However, the Office of the Prime Minister made a decision on June 6 to merge Forest Project with the Timber Corporation. Forest Minister of Province 2 Ramnaresh Raya claimed that this move from the Prime Minister’s Office was interference in the jurisdiction of the Province 2 government.Bechan Mahato, an employee at the Provincial Ministry of Industry, Forest, Environment, and Tourism, filed the petition on behalf of the ministry. ***What do you think?Dear reader, we’d like to hear from you.

Students at community schools deprived of education facilities,"Students of community schools in Dhanusha have been deprived of scholarships, textbooks and mid-day meals—provisions extended by the government—due to the negligence of the local units.Although the central government had released the budget to the local units for providing educational facilities to students at community schools in the district, the students are yet to avail the facilities. Teachers at various community schools have demanded that the local units return the budget—allocated to those schools—to the district-based Education Development and Coordination Unit in Janakpur. Most of the 18 local units in Dhanusha have yet to disburse budget to the schools meant for scholarships, mid-day meals, and textbooks, among others. In Hansapur Municipality, the municipal office only released the salary and allowances of teachers in the last fiscal year due to a dispute between the mayor and deputy mayor over allocation of budget.Satya Narayan Jha, the headmaster of Manipati Basic School in Hansapur-1, said that the municipal officials did not release the budget for scholarships and mid-day meals last year. “We don’t know what we will do this year. The students are deprived of scholarships and other facilities,” he said. Ramgyan Mandal, mayor of Hansapur Municipality, however, said that they were unable to release the budget meant for the community schools due to the shortage of employees. But Ram Snehi Yadav, chairman at the Dhanusha-based Nepal Teachers’ Association, blamed lackadaisical attitude of the elected representatives in Dhanusa towards community schools. “They have shown sheer negligence and irresponsibility by not releasing the budget meant for scholarships, mid-day meals, and textbooks,” said Yadav.Barakhu Prasad Rajak, chief at the Education Development and Coordination Unit, said that they are also receiving complaints against the local units. “The government directly sends the budget to the local units. We can only request the local units to release budget on time,” said Rajak.Following discussion with the Education Development and Coordination Unit in January, the people’s representatives had agreed to release the budget on time. But the agreement is yet to be implemented.The dropout rate of children remains higher in Dhanusha district but the student-oriented programmes have not been properly implemented. A total of 67,623 students enrolled in grade one to three in the last academic year, Shailendra Mallik, a teacher, said. “If we don’t make conscious efforts to keep students in school, more than two-thirds of the current students will drop out. The programmes that will help these students stay in school must not be discontinued.”","Published at : August 1, 2019",Janakpur,Shyam Sundar Shashi
Disabled senior citizens have to travel far to get social security allowance,"Dhutari Devi Sada suffers from paralysis. Given her condition, going to the bank to collect the Social Security Allowance provided by the government is proving to be an uphill task. In 2018, the government introduced a system to disburse the monthly social security allowance provided to elderly, disabled and children through banks. While the policy has already come into effect in most urban areas, it is yet to be implemented throughout the country, especially in remote areas. Dhutari Devi, 70, accompanied by her husband, Siyalal Sada, have to travel almost ten kilometers from their village to the district headquarters in Rajbiraj to collect their allowances every few months.“The banking system is a big problem for us,” Dhutari Devi said. “With this ailing body, it’s hard to travel long distances. The old-age allowance was meant to help us but instead, with the new policy, it has only added to our troubles.”To get to Rajbiraj from Parsahi, their village, the couple have to walk on foot for four kilometres to Topa Bazaar and take a tempo for the remaining six kilometres.The Post met the couple at a tea shop in Topa Bazaar while they were on their way back home after collecting their allowances on Thursday.“The government allowance is very essential for us,” said Dhutari Devi. “Hence, despite troubles, we are compelled to travel. It would be so much easier for us if we could get the money from the ward office.”To receive the allowance, the recipient has to be present at the bank in person. Therefore, for Dhutari Devi and many others like her, they have no choice but to make the journey to the headquarters, no matter how worse their conditions. “The provision of distributing social security benefits through banks was introduced to stop any financial embezzlement,” said Shyam Kumar Singh, chief district officer of Saptari. “Many elderly persons are having trouble reaching the bank but at least this move ensures that the allowances reach the right person. Embezzlement was all too frequent in the past.” ***What do you think?Dear reader, we’d like to hear from you.

Forest officials start tree plantation on encroached forestland,"The Division Forest Office Mahottari has started planting saplings at Patu in Bardibas-3 by evicting encroachers from the forestland.Hemanta Prasad Sah, chief at the division office, said that his office recovered five hectares of encroached land in the Patu Community Forest area. “We started evicting illegal settlers from the forestland after encroachment started to become uncontrollable in the district.”Santosh Kumar Yadav, a ranger at the Patu Area Forest Office, said they have started planting trees in the land after demolishing houses and huts built by the encroachers. The community forest is planting 10,000 saplings of Khayar and Kamali, among other trees. Yadav said they plan to plant around 50,000 saplings in Rajabas, Gauridanda, and Patu areas.Under the Forest Management Programme, the forest office has allocated Rs 2.5 million for the afforestation programme. “We are also going to conserve plants which were planted last fiscal year,” said Yadav.Locals are happy after the forest office started reclaiming the encroached land. Kamal Bahadur Kyapchhaki, a native of Bardibas-3, said that encroachers have used forestland as if it were their private property. “They have been building houses and cultivating in the forestland. It’s a good drive to remove them,” said Kyapchhaki.According to the forest office, there are 75 community and three collaborative forests in Mahottari district. Forest officials said hundreds of hectares of forestland have been encroached upon in the name of landless people and flood victims.Sah said the forest office has already notified occupants to move away. There are plans to build a fence around the forest.","Published at : July 27, 2019",Bardibas,Sunita Baral
Stretches of flood-damaged postal highway yet to be repaired,"The Postal Highway, which is considered as a lifeline in the southern region of Sarlahi district, has been disrupted after floods damaged road sections in more than a dozen places two week ago.The floods have swept away as long as 10 metres of road in several places. And as a result, transport in the areas have been obstructed—affecting thousands of locals. Respective local units constructed makeshift bamboo bridges a few days ago in the damaged highway. Pedestrians and two-wheelers are now using the makeshift bridges but movement of four wheelers are currently halted.The 42-km-long highway section links around 50 settlements, including district headquarters Malangawa near Nepal-India border. Every rainy season, floods damage the highway, disconnecting the villages with the district headquarters.“Floods in the Lakhandehi, Jhim and Manusmara streams damage the highway and inundate settlements. The bridges were constructed by narrowing the streams along the postal highway. As a result, in the monsoons, the water in the rivers overflow, sweeping away road sections,” said Ugrakanta Jha, a civil society leader. He says the poorly designed bridges along the highway is what is causing the flooding.Residents of the area complain that the authorities have paid no heed toward their problem, despite knowing what they go through every year in monsoon. “The highway is damaged by floods and inundation every year. In case a family member falls ill, we cannot take him/her to hospital in the Malangawa for treatment,” said Ram Biswas Raya of Bishnu Rural Municipality-8.The authorities concerned are yet to take the initiative to repair the damaged road sections—even after two weeks of the transportation disruption. Chief District Officer Krishna Bahadur Raut said the local administration urged the Division Road Office in Rautahat for immediate road repair.However, the road office has a different story. Daroga Prasad, the chief at the division road office, said they could not resume transportation along the damaged postal highway due to the non-cooperation of the federal and provincial governments. According to Prasad, the confusion regarding who is responsible—the federal or provincial governments—has left the repair work in limbo.“This highway should be under the federal government because of the importance it holds. But the budget was allocated to the province at the end of the last fiscal year. There is still confusion over the responsibility so the repair work is yet to be initiated,” said Prasad.","Published at : July 27, 2019",Sarlahi,Om Prakash Thakur
25 children killed by floods—and careless construction—in Province 2 over nine days,"For the better part of last week, children in Jaleshwor were forced to stay indoors as the week-long torrential rains showed no signs of stopping, and the floodwaters from Ratu Khola submerged parts of the town.On July 14, just as the rain was during its peak, Yubaraj Thakur and Prashant Thakur, two brothers aged 13 and 12, stepped out of their home to buy carrom coins. It was a little past noon and the brothers were unaware of the intensity of the floodwater outside.About 300 metres from their home, the brothers reached a culvert overflowing with water, and before anyone noticed, they were swept away.The next day, Prashant’s body was found near the culvert. The elder brother, Yubaraj, was found dead in Machha Bazaar, another 300 metres away from the culvert.“We were all down for an afternoon nap and didn’t realise they had gone outside,” said Harichandra Thakur, the grandfather. “The area was flooded in knee-deep water.” The Yadav brothers were just two of the 25 children who have lost their lives from floods in Province 2 in the past nine days. At least 40 people have been killed after nonstop rains heavily flooded parts of the region. The children who have died range anywhere from 15 months to 14 years.The minors’ deaths, however, are not directly linked with floods, according to officials at provincial offices. Most of them died by drowning in the trenches dug for several construction projects that have been left unattended by the contractors responsible for those projects.“Our preliminary findings show that most children fell into trenches dug out on roadsides. Roads are dug out for construction purposes but they are never filled,” said Madhu Nepal, a police inspector. “Our data also shows that children were lost in the floods when parents weren’t looking.” The practice of intensifying construction work before the end of the fiscal year is widespread in Province 2. During the process, most of the trenches have been dug to excavate mud for building roads and culverts. “Those deaths are due to lack of awareness among parents about what safety measures to adopt during times of crisis,” Nepal, the police official, said.But Chief Minister of Province 2, Mohammed Lal Babu Raut, said that the floods aren’t the problem. It’s the haphazard trenches and pits that have proved fatal in the province this monsoon season. “This is a grave issue we can’t afford to overlook,” Raut said. “As an attempt to solve this, we are soon introducing a set of rules that penalises contractors who are irresponsible. Perpetrators will be punished.”Raut also pointed fingers at some high-level provincial officials, who he said own dozers and excavators used in large construction projects. “In many cases, these officials themselves act carelessly,” Raut said. “We will keep an eye out for the careless contractors and bring the perpetrators to book.”Ram Snehi Roy, the mayor of Bindavan Municipality in Rautahat, said the recent series of fatal accidents have taught them a lesson and the municipality office will punish the contractors for leaving construction sites incomplete ahead of a flood-prone monsoon season.Meanwhile, according to officials at provincial police headquarters, the deaths of children due to flood continue. Two children were killed on Friday in Rautahat and two more lost their lives in Siraha on Saturday. In the past nine days, three children were killed in Parsa, two in Bara, one each in Sarlahi and Dhanusha. ***What do you think?Dear reader, we’d like to hear from you.

Sarlahi disaster management body halts relief distribution,"The District Disaster Management Committee (DDMC) in Sarlahi has postponed the relief distribution programme, suspecting that some fake flood victims were collecting aid.The committee’s move, however, has saddened many  genuine flood victims who are staying under tarpaulin makeshifts.Officials at the DDMC said they had stopped relief distribution to collect the details of the destruction. According to initial data of the DDMC, 2,400 families were affected by the floods in mid-July. A committee meeting in Malangawa, the district headquarters of Sarlahi, decided on Friday to stop relief distribution to conduct a detailed survey. The meeting also decided to repair damaged parts of Postal Highway and other feeder roads.Laldhari Paswan, a displaced flood victim in Dhankaul Rural Municipality-3, said they are waiting for relief materials. “How can we stay for a long time under a flimsy makeshift?” asked Paswan.Another Paspati Devi, a local woman, who was displaced due to the flooded stream around 10 days ago, said that they had to wait for at least two weeks to receive relief materials. Chief District Officer Krishna Bahadur Raut, who is also chairman at the DDMC, said that the meeting had decided to provide immediate relief to those rendered homeless. “Others will receive relief only after the survey,” said Raut.A few days ago, authorities had collected data of the flood victims only by asking ward chairmen about the destruction.“Now, we will gather details of destruction by identifying victim’s names, their family members and property loss,” said Raut, adding that they have to conduct the survey as they received complaints that fake flood victims are also receiving relief materials.Authorities said that they needed to conduct the survey to make relief distribution process effective. All of the stakeholders concerned have agreed to distribute relief through a one-door policy.The local administration was distributing food grains and tarpaulins to the flood affected households in the district. The rain swollen Manusmara stream inundated Dhankaul, Harkathawa, Mahinathpur, Dhaptol, Chhatol, Bairiya, Hirapur and Bhawanipur among two dozen villages in the district. Some of the victims have already returned to their homes after the water level receded in their settlement while others are still staying under the tents.

But, to his surprise, his work was done in under 15 minutes.“Earlier, we used to have service delays, as a result of non-cooperation on the part of the employees while visiting the office. But today, with the help desk at the office in place, things were a breeze,” he said.The city office had recently established a help desk at the ward office after receiving complaints from service seekers about the sluggish pace of work at the office.

This is what it’s like to be homeless every monsoon,"Every year, Radha Devi Mukhiya watches patiently as the monsoon arrives. She knows what is going to happen next, but there is little she can do about it. As the rains come down, the waters in the nearby Saptakoshi rise, breaching the banks and flooding the village of Hanuman Nagar Kakalini in Saptari. Mukhiya collects her belongings and moves to the nearby embankment, where she lives under a tent for two to three months, waiting for the floodwaters to recede, surviving on relief material handed out by the government and various charities. This has been Mukhiya’s routine for over three decades now. “My family goes through this every year. I was married into this family when I was 16 and I remember my grandfather-in-law telling us about how the floodwaters would enter the village,” said 50-year-old Mukhiya. “Then, it was my father-in-law’s turn to live like this. Now it’s mine.” This year, as continuous rainfall led to flooding across the country, Radha Devi has been trapped in her village since Saturday. Knee-deep water had entered the village, drowning her possessions under a foot of the Saptakoshi. In her one-storey thatched roof home, there were few belongings she could salvage. Mukhiya is helpless against the yearly phenomenon. She is too poor to build a proper elevated home and she cannot afford to move out of her village. After her husband died, her family, consisting of her son, daughter-in-law and grandson, have been subsisting as daily wage labourers, with few savings. “We work all year round in the fields and store food grains in our house, but every rainy season, the floodwaters take away everything,” said Mukhiya. Things have only gotten worse in recent years, said Mukhiya. The village, which is around two kilometres from the river, now floods more than before. Mukhiya blames a pilot channel constructed by India that changed the course of the river. The river now flows towards the west, flooding villages, like Hanuman Nagar Kankalini, on the western banks. There are no options but to move the entire settlement, said Shailesh Sah, mayor of Hanuman Nagar Kankalini municipality. “The only way to save these settlements is to move them to safer locations, but the municipality does not have the money to buy land and build new houses,” he said.Data from the municipality shows that around 70 percent of flood victims are from impoverished backgrounds, primarily Musahars, Chamars and Malahas, who are unable to afford to migrate to safer areas in the district by themselves. “We are planning to provide Rs 200,000 each to families so that they can move to safer areas,” said Sah.But for Mukhiya, the money might bring immediate relief, but it will not guarantee a long-term solution. “The ward chairperson tells us that the municipality will give us some money. I don’t know if that is true, but even if it is, the amount he has mentioned is not going to be enough for us to be able to move out, buy land and build a house elsewhere,” she said. Lacking any real options, Mukhiya has grown accustomed to her yearly displacement, where she expects the monsoon to flood her home and push her to living in a temporary settlement for months. “I’m afraid this sorrow is not going to end with us,” said Mukhiya, turning to her daughter-in-law, sitting nearby with a year-old child in her arms. “My grandchildren have already started living the nightmare now.”***What do you think?Dear reader, we’d like to hear from you.

Flood victims spend nights in makeshift shelter in Rautahat,"Sixty-five year old Saraswati Koiri broke her left leg while trying to escape from floood waters  that gushed into her village on Friday night.She was rescued by her son. Both mother and son had a close shave with nature as torrential rainfall flooded their village of Badaharwa in Durga Bhawati Rural Municipality, Rautahat.The flood destroyed all the family’s belongings and the crops in their field.It’s been five days since the incident, and Koiri is yet to receive medical care for her broken leg.“We hope the government will manage a place for us to live. We will manage the food,” Koiri said.Before the flood, Badaharwa had 400 houses; 338 of them were either damaged or swept away on Friday night. Two hundred families are spending nights in makeshift shelters on the banks of Bagmati River. Forty more are living in ‘safe homes’ put together by Mandavi Organisation, a philanthropic institution. But there’s a scarcity of water and food in these makeshift shelters, according to the flood displaced people. Basic sanitation is also lacking, as a result of which many people have contracted cold.“There is also the threat of snakes. It’s a very difficult situation here,” said Jasoda Devi Sah, a flood victim taking shelter on the banks of Bagmati River. On Tuesday, a team of Nepal Army and Armed Police Force led by Chief District Officer Kiran Thapa visited the shelters for flood displaced people and distributed relief materials, including tarpaulin sheets and food.But the flood victims said tarpaulins were of little use to them.“We don’t need any more relief materials. What we need is a safe space to live in,” said Indraju Das, another flood displaced villager. ***What do you think?Dear reader, we’d like to hear from you.

The injured and families of martyrs wanted cash. They got buffaloes instead.,"Rajeshwor Sah Kanu can barely walk. Ever since his prosthetic leg broke, he’s been having trouble moving around. But on Monday, July 8, Kanu received a lactating buffalo from the Province 2 government as compensation for the injuries he sustained during the 2007 Madhes Movement—those very injuries that had led to the loss of his right leg.“I asked for financial assistance for medical treatment, but instead, they gave me a buffalo,” said Kanu. “What am I going to do with this buffalo?”Kanu, who’s from Kalikamai village in Parsa district, was just one of the many who received a lactating buffalo each from the provincial government. The Province 2 government had decided to distribute a buffalo to those injured and the families of those who died during the Madhes movement, the second people’s movement, and the Maoist insurgency. Alongside Kanu, 25 others from Bara and Parsa districts were compensated for their losses with a four-legged bovine each, and Rs30,000 in cash to build a shed and provide medical treatment to the animals. The buffaloes were distributed by the provincial Ministry of Land Management, Agriculture and Cooperatives. But most are unhappy with their recompense, saying they’d prefer cash instead.  Rajeshwor Sah Kanu, a victim of the 2007 Madhes Movement, received a lactating buffalo as compensation.  Post Photo: Bhusan YadavThe disabled feel particularly “insulted” by the government’s “thoughtless” decision.“This shows their insensitivity towards us,” said Kanu. “The buffalo is now an additional burden. I can’t look after it and it can’t look after me.”  Jitendra Yadav, who has a permanent limp from a bullet injury also sustained during the Madhes Movement, came all the way from Kalaiya in Bara to Birgunj to receive his buffalo. But he too was unsure of what he could do with the animal. “I came here to receive the buffalo but I don’t know what I will do with it,” said Yadav. “It would’ve been better if the authorities had given us financial aid to seek medical treatment.”  Yadav doesn’t want to keep animals, as his injury prevents him from the physicality associated with animal husbandry. He’d rather work another job, he said.“We were asked to choose between a cow and a buffalo, but I don’t want either. I didn’t join the Madhes movement to become a herder. The government should provide us with employment opportunities as per our skills and competency,” said Yadav. “I can’t even stand on my own feet, how will I rear a buffalo?” So far this fiscal year, the provincial government has distributed buffaloes to 64 people who were injured and the families of 58 martyrs. The buffaloes cannot be sold for three years and they cannot be given to others as gifts, according to Indra Dev Sah, acting chief of the Province 2 Livestock Service Office.  But despite the dissatisfaction of the recipients, the provincial government appears to believe that a live animal is a necessary piece of the compensation due. “The provincial government was formed due to their sacrifice and it is the government’s responsibility to honour the martyrs and the injured,” said Chief Minister Mohammad Lalbabu Raut at the buffalo distribution ceremony in Birgunj on Monday. “Buffaloes are certainly not enough, but this is just the beginning.”  The provincial government’s decision has been met with heavy criticism, not just for the insensitivity of compensation for the injured but also for ignoring the very real needs of the injured and the families of those martyred. “The children of martyrs and the injured should be provided free education, not given buffaloes to herd. They need opportunities to lead a better life, not an additional burden,” said Om Prakash Saraf, a social campaigner who was active during the Madhes movements. Various Madhes-based parties had announced that they would provide Rs5 million each to the families of martyrs, but so far, have only distributed buffaloes that cost Rs50,000 each.","Published at : July 11, 2019",Birgunj,Bhusan Yadav
Kin of Saroj Narayan Mahato yet to receive compensation,"The family of Saroj Narayan Mahato, who was killed in police firing at Ishwarpur in Sarlahi last month, is yet to receive compensation from the government.According to Mahato’s family, the government has not offered any compensation apart from the Rs 25,000 provided by the municipality as funeral fees.Mahato was shot dead by police on June 30 while protesting the death of a boy after falling into a sand pit.Amit Raya, 12, had died after falling into a 30-foot sand pit in the Banke river on June 29. On the following day, the residents of Ishwarpur had gathered on the East-West Highway to protest Raya’s death, claiming that he had fallen into an illegally dug sand pit.Mahato died on the spot when a shot fired by police struck him in his head. Following Mahato’s death, Ishwarpur Municipality agreed to recommend Mahato to be declared a martyr, provide a job to his wife at the ward office and provide adequate compensation to his family.“It’s been more than a week since the incident, but we have not heard from anyone,” said Mahato’s brother Manoj Singh.Ishwarpur Mayor Manoj Devkota said the municipal office has initiated the process of providing compensation to Mahato’s family.“We will release the compensation after the Cabinet has taken a decision regarding the matter,” he said.","Published at : July 11, 2019",Sarlahi,Om Prakash Thakur
Enraged locals protest sluggish work at Jaleshwore-Janakpur road section,"Jaleshwore locals have taken to the streets to protest sluggish work in the construction of Jaleshwore-Janakpur road section. Sloganeering against the contractors tasked with the construction, the locals on Friday obstructed the road at Zero Mile in Jaleshwore.Speaking to the Post, protesters warned of demonstrating for an hour every day if their demands are not addressed.Barun Dahal, the chief of Jaleshwore Ward-2 who coordinated the protest, said that the demonstration was against the sluggish work and to push the contractors to make significant progress before monsoon sets in.“If the road is not complete by the start of monsoon, it will become a nightmare for the locals,” Dahal said. “Since the work shows no signs of progress, we are compelled to protest.”According to Dahal, the contractors had earlier promised to complete the one-lane road stretch from Zero Mile to Khayera Chowk by mid-June but a month past the deadline the work is yet to be completed.The contract for the 18km-long Jaleshwore-Bhittamode road was signed on August 2016. As per the contract, the work was supposed to be completed by August 2019. But as the deadline approaches, only 70 percent of the total work is complete. Locals squarely ascribe this fiasco to the negligence of contractors.Many locals have filed a complaint against the contractors at the District Administration Office but Chief District Officer Umesh Dhakal said his office doesn’t have the authority to punish the perpetrators.“We have, however, pressured them to complete the work,” Dhakal said.The responsibility to oversee the progress of road construction falls under the Hulaki Highway Directorate.According to officials at the directorate, the road will be upgraded to four lanes once it’s complete while there will be extra ‘service lanes’ at three spots along the way.The company YP JV was provided the contract for the 9km road stretch from Janakpur to Bighi Bridge in Mahottari. The contract was worth Rs435.4 million in total. The Ashish Pappu Roshan JV had got the contract for the stretch linking South Jaleshwore with the Indian border for Rs 498.9 million.","Published at : July 7, 2019",Mahottari,Rabindra Upreti
Tailoring training empowers Tharu women,"Twenty-eight-year-old Putari Devi from Sakhuania in Parsa is a housewife who has been illiterate her entire life. She would spend most of her days doing household chores, and if there was nothing to do, she would just idle her time away.But lately, she has got a purpose, something to do instead of whiling her time away, thanks to a three-month tailoring training.“Now I have a professional skill. If there’s nothing to do, I just sew clothes,” Putari Devi saidPutari Devi has not just acquired a new skill but also a means to make a living. She, along with Kabita Chaudhary—a fellow tailoring trainee from her village, plan to open a tailor shop soon. “I am confident that I can earn for myself by utilising my newly learned skill,” Chaudhary said.Besides Putari Devi and Chaudhary, 40 other women—mostly from the Tharu community—have benefitted from the training, which is currently ongoing in the village. The training was conducted by the Surya Institute of Technology, Birgunj, in coordination with Jira Bhawani Rural Municipality.“Most of the women from the Tharu community are illiterate and unemployed,” said Prakash Tharu, chief of finance at the institute, “The training was conducted in an attempt to make them independent. We are humbled by such an enthusiastic participation.”The training is currently in its final leg. The participants say that they can make garments for women such as blouse, petticoat, gown and kurta suruwal.“Once the training is over, we plan to provide employment opportunities to the trainees. We are currently in talks with garment industries around Birgunj,” Tharu said.","Published at : July 6, 2019",Parsa,Shankar Acharya
Consumers’ committee in Sarlahi carries out exemplary work,"Reports on the misuse of development budget, both by contractors and consumers’ committees, at the end of the current fiscal year are currently making headlines. But a consumer’s committee in Lalbandi in Sarlahi district is in the news for all the right reasons.A consumers’ committee, formed to construct an agricultural road, has completed its work on time, carried out more work than mentioned in the agreement, and managed to achieve this feat within the given budget. Lalbandi Municipality allocated a budget of Rs 2 million to the committee to build a 165-metre section of the agriculture road. The work involved digging up the stretch, levelling the land, laying concrete and blacktopping. The consumer committee managed to construct the road, pave an additional 20-metre stretch, and save some money as well.Suraj Thapa, chairman of the consumers’ committee, said that they saved Rs 179,484 from the allocated budget. “We all took ownership of the project because it will benefit our own community. We have even made our accounts transparent, if people want to look at the quality of the products we have used,” said Thapa.According to Surendra Neupane, ward chief of Lalbandi-7, four consumers’ committees in his ward completed their works responsibly in the current fiscal year. “Four consumers’ committees carried out good work and even saved some money. Their work proves that if we work honestly, we can do quality work on time and within budget,” said Neupane, adding that the spare budget would be used to carry out other development activities in the same area. Mayor Man Bahadur Khadka also had similar sentiments, saying the agricultural road constructed by the consumers’ committee sets an example for all other construction works that are to be carried out in the municipality.","Published at : July 5, 2019",Sarlahi,Om Prakash Thakur
Killing of a Madhesi brings age-old question to the fore: when can the police fire a live bullet?,"On Sunday afternoon, when residents of Ishwarpur in Sarlahi decided to gather on the East-West Highway to protest the death of a minor, Saroj Mahato was at the small restaurant he had started just last year.A day earlier, a 12-year-old boy had died after falling into a 30-foot sand pit in the Banke river, and villagers were furious. The pit had formed due to illegal sand mining, according to local residents, under the protection of their elected representatives and the police.By the time Mahato joined the protest, hundreds of people had gathered along the highway, demanding a halt to the illegal excavation of sand and stones from the river and compensation for the boy’s family.But things quickly turned tragic. As the demonstration got larger, police fired live rounds at the protesters. Mahato, who was known to villagers as Kebal, was struck by a bullet on his head and died on the spot.Mahato’s killing on Sunday, once again, has brought to the fore how the country’s law enforcement agency fails to exercise restraint, human rights activists say, and quickly resorts to firing live rounds when it comes to protests in the country’s southern plains.“We are shocked by the gross human rights violations in this case,” Gyanendra Yadav, Province 2’s minister for internal affairs and law, told the Post over the phone on Monday. Following the killing, an all-party meeting called by the District Coordination Committee on Monday demanded a judicial investigation into the incident and compensation for Mahato’s family.“The family and villagers have said they will not receive the body until their demands are met,” said Pramod Shah, a provincial assembly member of Province 2. “The Chief District Officer has assured us that he will take initiatives to address our demands.""Activists have drawn attention to repeated instances in the past when the Nepal Police resorted to excessive force and indiscriminate firing when it came to protests in the Tarai.In 2015, during the months-long demonstrations against the constitution, more than 40 people were killed in violent protests—15 protesters were shot dead by the police, according to Human Rights Watch.Similarly, in the months leading up to the 2017 parliamentary elections, police had opened fire on protesters during an election-related fracas involving the then Samyukta Loktantrik Madhesi Morcha and the then CPN-UML. Five people were killed.“Incidents of excessive use of force have been increasing in the Tarai,” said Charan Prasai, a human rights activist. “In many similar incidents in the past, victims were shot in the head. This shows that either the government has deployed untrained police personnel or the killing was intentional.”Numerous reports by both national and international human rights organisations have detailed how the Nepal Police handles protests and treats citizens differently, depending on their ethnicities.A recent report by Advocacy Forum, a human rights organisation, stated that communities from the Tarai, primarily Madhesis and Tharus, face higher rates of torture and violence while in police custody.Deputy Inspector General of Police Pradhyumna Karki, chief of police in Province 2, however, defended the police action on the grounds that the situation had “gone out of control”.After firing 15 rounds of tear gas shells, police also fired rubber bullets before firing into the air, said Karki. Protesters also hurled stones at security personnel.“Security personnel were compelled to use force as they were left with no option. Several police personnel had been injured,” Karki told the Post.But rights activists say the police did not follow due process.“The authorities must prove that the situation was out of control,” said Gauri Pradhan, a human rights activist. “If such incidents continue, dissatisfaction among the public will only continue to increase.”For activists, there are concerns over who authorised the police to open fire. Under Nepali law, the riot police are not authorised to independently fire live rounds on protestors.According to Karki, such decisions are taken by the District Security Committee, which is led by the chief district officer; a lieutenant colonel from the Nepal Army; superintendents from the Nepali Police, Armed Police Force and National Investigation Department; and an assistant chief district officer as the member secretary.Sarlahi Chief District Officer Krishna Bahadur Raut, however, said that a field officer “had consulted with his supervisor”, who had given permission to fire on the crowd. Raut said that this too is correct due process, especially if officers believe that their lives are in danger.For provincial government officials, decision-making over sensitive matters relating to security has long been a bone of contention, as they don’t have any representation on the security committee.Federal and provincial governments have long been at odds over a proposed Police Bill, which provisions for chief district officers to “coordinate” security matters. Provincial governments have taken issue with this provision, as chief district officers are appointed by the federal government and are accountable to the Home Ministry in Kathmandu, not to the provincial internal affairs ministry. So provincial governments have no power of their own to mobilise police or to hold them to account.Even as the police continued to justify their actions throughout Monday, Mahato’s family, including his wife and six-month-old son, was in mourning. Mahato had just returned from Qatar over a year ago and started his restaurant with his brother Manoj.“Just before he was shot, Saroj was saying we should return home because the police had started using force,” Manoj told the Post. “We went to protest the death of a village boy due to government negligence and in the process, I lost my brother.”","Published at : July 2, 2019",Kathmandu,Tika R Pradhan						 &
"One killed, several  hurt as police open fire at protesters in Sarlahi","One person died and a dozen others sustained injuries when police opened fire at the people gathered on the East-West Highway in Sarlahi on Sunday to protest the death of a young boy after falling into a sand pit in Banke River.Kebal Mahato, 27, of Ishwarpur Municipality, died of gunshot injuries while he was protesting the death of 12-year-old Amit Roy, who died after plunging into a 30-feet sand pit on Saturday. The residents of Ishwarpur claimed that the sand mine was being operated illegally with the protection of local elected representatives and police administration. On Sunday afternoon, they took to the street carrying Roy’s body and obstructed the East-West Highway. They were demanding the authorities concerned to stop illegal excavation of sand and pebbles from the Banke river, fill the sand pits, ban illegal crusher plants and provide adequate compensation to Roy’s family.According to Province 2 police chief DIG Pradhyumna Karki, the situation descended into violence as the protesters started hurling stones at security personnel. “Police requested time and again to clear the highway, but these requests were replied with stones and bricks. The situation soon got out of control, and the security personnel were compelled to open fire,” he said. Though the government standards state that a pit dug for excavating sand and pebbles should not be over three feet deep, the one at the Banke river is over 30 feet deep, claimed the protesters. Meanwhile, the Province 2 government has formed a three-member committee to investigate the shooting incident. It has also decided to provide compensation to the families of Roy and Mahato.Minister of Internal Affairs and Law Gyanendra Kumar Yadav criticised the incident by terming it as “the continuation of police apathy”.“The police briefed the provincial government only after the incident, which is unfortunate,” Yadav said. “The protesters could have been dispersed without the use of force or violence. There was no need to open fire.” Pramod Sah, a member of Province 2 assembly, also condemned the police shooting on a civilian. “The protest was a result of police’s delayed response in extracting Roy’s body from the pit. The police could have easily cleared the highway without opening fire. The move was irresponsible,” he said.","Published at : July 1, 2019",Janakpur,Ajit Tiwari						 &
Construction worker shot in Sarlahi,"An unidentified group shot at a construction worker at Nawalpur in Lalbandi Municipality, Sarlahi, in broad daylight on Saturday.Two motorcycle-borne assailants shot at Jayanath Mahato, aged 30, while he was working at a temple construction site. The victim received bullet injuries in his arm. Mahato was taken to Birgunj after primary care at a local health facility.The motive behind the shooting is not immediately known, said DSP Pratit Singh Rathour, adding that an investigation is underway.Preliminary investigation showed that the assailants first went to Mahato’s house and inquired about him. They later came to Bramhasthan Temple where the victim was working. According to eyewitnesses, the attackers fired at Mahato and immediately fled the scene.“It seems that the assailants attempted to murder him. Security personnel have been mobilised in the area to nab the culprits,” said DSP Rathour.Local residents have been terrorised following the shooting as criminal activities have gone unchecked in the district lately. Supriya Bharati, the wife of Dr Dipendra Rajak at Sarlahi Eye Hospital, was murdered at the hospital quarters on Thursday. The culprits have yet to be arrested.","Published at : June 30, 2019",Sarlahi,Om Prakash Thakur
Local representatives of Balara up in arms against their mayor,"Dispute among the people’s representatives of Balara Municipality in Sarlahi reached new heights after its mayor set up his office in his village when his staff padlocked the municipal office to protest his working style.The deputy mayor and seven ward chiefs padlocked the municipal office on June 19, blaming Mayor Abhaya Kumar Singh of running the office as per his vested interest. The dispute escalated after Singh set up his office at Hathiyaul on Sunday.“I had to set up an alternative office to execute the essential works of the municipality,” Singh said. “The current fiscal year is about to end and this is a crucial time to release budget for the ongoing development projects. We also have to select new projects for the upcoming year.”This is not the first time that the municipal office has been padlocked; the deputy mayor and the ward chairpersons had padlocked the municipal office three months ago as well. The incident had prompted Singh to stage a hunger strike.The local representatives claimed that they ultimately agreed to open the office after the mayor assured them of addressing their demands.“However, the mayor seems bent on creating conflict instead of solving the problem,” said Manoj Mohan Kumar, the ward chief of Balara-5.The dispute has mostly affected the locals of Balara Municipality. They have been deprived of timely services at the local unit, and the development activities have also come to a halt.“Our municipality is lagging behind in development mainly due to the dispute among the representatives. We feel that our representatives lack leadership quality,” said Anil Kumar Singh, a local.","Published at : June 25, 2019",Sarlahi,Om Prakash Thakur
Migrant workers in Province 2 falling victim to HIV/AIDS,"About a year ago, a 35-year-old man—who spoke with the Post only on the condition of anonymity—returned home from India with some savings and a big secret. He had contracted the HIV virus. He underwent treatment at the Shukraraj Tropical & Infectious Disease Hospital in Teku, Kathmandu, but discontinued treatment and medications once he returned to his home district in Mahottari. He feared he would fall prey to the stigma attached with the lethal disease, and thus stopped taking medication to hide his disease from his family.Last week, the patient suffered from chronic fever and diarrhea, and was admitted to the Janakpur Zonal Hospital. Only then did he let his family know that he was HIV positive. Like him, many HIV patients hide their ailments from family members and society fearing rebuke and rejection.“His health is worsening by the day,” said Pravin Yadav of the hospital’s HIV/AIDS department. “We are giving our best but his state has not improved much.”In Province 2, in 2018, a total of 6,422 people had been diagnosed with HIV. Among them, more than 2,000 people are currently on medication, according to Dr Pramod Yadav, health director of Province 2. Yadav added that most of the patients are foreign employment returnees, like the 35-year-old who returned from India after he figured he was HIV positive.“The condition is critical,” Yadav told the Post. “The economic standards of the families might have improved, as youths have been sending remittances into the country, but the rate at which the virus has spread is alarming.” A total of 453 patients are taking medicines regularly at the Janakpur Zonal Hospital; over 1,000 in Narayani Regional Hospital; and around 700 in Rajbiraj Hospital. According to Yadav, most of the patients are between the age group of 20-35.Nabin Mallik, programme director of Sparsha Nepal, an organisation working towards HIV/AIDS control, said the condition is “dangerous.” “Most of the patients are illiterate,” Mallik said, “ and that means they are unaware of safe sex practices, and are negligent about treatment when they contract the disease—making matters worse.”Lately, the communicable disease has also spread among the families of the infected, say health workers. According to data provided by Province-2 Health Directorate for 2018, 158 children have contracted the disease. “There are instances of disease contraction among wives and children of the victims,” said Rajesh Thakur of the Directorate.Mallik of Sparsha Nepal said that the doctors in the team have been regularly running checkups in various locations to track of HIV patients. “We are focussing on running checkups among those who have recently returned from foreign employment,” Mallik said.","Published at : June 25, 2019",Janakpur,Ajit Tiwari
Locals implement innovative idea to campaign against early marriage,"In a bid to control child marriage in the Tarai region, people are being asked to adopt innovative ways to curb child marriage practices. One such fresh move is to design and use wedding invitation cards that include the date of birth of both the bride and the bridegroom.Behind the move is Sunil Sah, a social campaigner of Lahan-10 in Siraha, who practiced what he preaches, he said, “My niece, Nisha, is getting married on Wednesday and I designed her wedding invitation cards mentioning her and her groom’s date of birth.” Sah, who has been campaigning against child marriage, said that this idea has begun germinating in the minds of the parents whose children have reached marriageable age in Tarai districts. According to him, he has started the trend of mentioning the birth dates of both the bride and the bridegroom in the wedding invitation cards from his family to dessiminate a message that child marriage is illegal in accordance with the existing law.According to the recently amended Civil Code, the minimum age for marriage in Nepal for both women and men is 20.Sah, who is also a legal advocate, says child marriage is still prevalent in Madhes, and conscious citizens should raise their voices against child marriage and boycott any function that doesn’t inform invitees about the age of the prospective bride and groom. As per the data of the District Police Office, three incidents of child marriage were reported in the district in the current fiscal year. Police, people’s representatives and social campaigners were able to stop four cases of child marriage in the district this year.Raj Kumar Raut Kurmi, a rights activist, said that majority of Dalit communities—including Dom community—still practice child marriage in the Tarai. “Parents often marry off their daughters while they are in their teens due to rampant dowry practice. They think that they should provide enough dowries to their daughters while marrying them off,” said Kurmi. According to him, all concerned stakeholders should join their hands to fight against child marriage and the dowry system.Child marriage has been illegal in Nepal since 1962, but a complex web of factors still makes the practice persist. Around 37 percent of girls marry before they turn 18, while 10 percent marry before celebrating their 15th birthday in the country, according to a Human Rights Watch report published in September 2016.","Published at : June 25, 2019",Siraha,Bharat Jarghamagar

Mayor calls off son’s wedding with minor girl after complaint,"The mayor of Bideha Municipality in Dhanusha district has postponed his son’s wedding after a complaint was lodged with police stating that it was a case of child marriage.Mayor Bechan Das had arranged the marriage of his son with a woman from the neighbouring Saptari district. Preparations were in full swing for the wedding scheduled for the third week of June.However, the elected representative was compelled to put off the wedding after a person registered a complaint with police. The petitioner has urged for an immediate action, claiming that the girl is underage.Under the new civil and criminal codes that came into force in 2018, both the bride and bridegroom should be at least 20 years old for marriage.Talking to the Post over the phone, mayor’s brother Lakhan said the marriage was arranged as the boy’s family was unaware of girl’s age. “How can a mayor, who is responsible for stopping the child marriage, arrange his son’s wedding with an underage girl? So we stopped the wedding,” said Lakhan.According to the women cell at District Police Office in Dhanusha-17, a number of written complaints had been filed against child marriage with police in the past 10 months. Consequently, 16 of the weddings were cancelled before the bride and bridegroom tied their nuptial knot.Sub-Inspector Ram Krishna Chaudhary, the chief at the woman cell, said the cases filed against child marriage had been on the rise in the past few months.The new civil and criminal codes, which were enforced on August 17 last year, has acted as a deterrent against the guardians who want to arrange marriage of their underage children.Earlier, the minimum legal age of marriage was 18 for the girls and 20 for the boys. Under the existing legal provisions, anyone found involved in child marriage will be jailed up to three years and fined up to Rs10,000.","Published at : June 18, 2019",Janakpur,Shyam Sundar Shashi

Lahan-4 residents protest against mismanagement of waste in the municipality,"Garbage overflowing onto the streets across Lahan Bazaar in Siraha district has not been collected for the past 26 days owing to a protest led by residents of Ward 4. The residents have been demanding authorities to relocate the waste management centre from their locality or manage the waste through a proper scientific method.The municipality had been using the waste management centre at Ward 4 as a dumping ground for the past five years. But ever since the protest, Lahan-4 along with the rest of the town has turned into a dumping ground for lack of an alternate waste management centre.The locals of Lahan-4 have been protesting outside the municipality office for almost a month now, asking the municipality to take responsibility of the garbage dumped at the gates of the garbage management centre and in the town area.“The locals were compelled to protest against the municipality since the piled up garbage was generating toxic fumes, posing health risks to nearby settlements,” said Ramnath Pandit, ward chairman of Lahan-4.Every street and market place in the town is now littered with garbage. The locals fear a possible outbreak of disease. Through their protest, they urged the municipality to immediately find ways to solve the garbage disposal issue.The municipality had formed a seven-member committee two months ago to find an alternative to the current dumping site.

Chandrapur is on its way to become child marriage-free municipality,"With the recent declaration of its Ward 5 as a child marriage-free zone, six of the ten wards in Chandrapur Municipality, Rautahat, have now joined the national campaign for eradicating child marriage from the country by 2030.The municipality aims to get rid of child marriage from all its 10 wards by early 2021. Officials and stakeholders say it’s going to be an uphill task, since the Dalits, the predominant community in Chandrapur, have long been practicing child marriage as their tradition.But Mayor Ramchandra Chaudhary believes they can achieve the goal through community cooperation.“Child marriage is still prevalent in remote areas of Rautahat, especially among the marginalised, Dalit and Muslim communities, and we are committed to declaring the whole municipality child marriage free by early 2021,” Chaudhary said. “Now on, no parents will marry off their underage children. For which we seek coordination from everyone.”When Chandrapur Municipality Ward No 5 was declared child marriage free, the locals vocally supported the announcement and promised to coordinate with the authorities.But it remains to be seen how far people are willing to go to support the cause.Only last year, residents of Naya Basti, a settlement in Chandrapur Ward No 7, had protested the presence of social campaigners in their neighbourhood who were there for an awareness programme against child marriage. The Naya Basti residents had argued that eliminating child marriage would be against their age-old culture. They had even tried to manhandle the campaigners.“The perception that when a child is married off early, the parents would have to spend less money for dowry is still rife,” said Menuka Bharati, of Janasewa Nepal, an NGO that is working with the local governments in Rautahat to end child marriage in the district.“There are many challenges. Some parents argue that if we were to stop child marriage now, we’d be responsible for marrying off their children once they grow up. Others say they cannot give up their age-old tradition.“It’s not easy to change their perceptions. We need to start from the grassroots level if we are to mitigate the practice,” she added.There are some incidents that serve as a glimmer of hope, though. Janasewa Nepal, which has set up its complaint desks in 50 schools across Rautahat, has received a great deal of support from, mainly from girl students, in its anti-child marriage campaign.The organisation has stopped four child marriages in the past one month alone.Likewise, three girls were honoured by Chandrapur Municipality recently for stopping a child marriage by informing the authorities.There are several social organisations working to end child marriage in Rautahat. Their efforts seem to have some positive effects, but the quest to free the district of child marriage is still fraught with challenges in the forms of tradition and resistance to change.Devaki Nepal, a child rights activist, says child marriage is mostly common among immiserated communities.“The communities that practice child marriage are not only illiterate but also poor.

Similarly, the Kathmandu-Tarai expressway is under construction around 18 kilometres east from the highway. All these development activities are affecting wildlife movement as the Adhabhar and Pathalaiya-Amalekhgunj section of the Tribhuvan Highway arethe main traditional bio-corridors for the wild animals in the PNP and adjoining community forests.Conservationists are of the opinion that free movement of wild animals will return to normalcy after the completion of the oil pipeline project next year. However, the operation of the Kathmandu-Tarai expressway will affect wildlife movement in the area.To ensure free movement of wild animals, concerned authorities have decided to construct two underpasses alongside the under-construction expressway. The underpasses are being constructed in a community forest in Bara district, which is about two kilometres from the eastern border of the PNP and around seven kilometres north from Nijgadh section of the East-West Highway. However, conservationists argue that just two underpasses would not be enough for the free movement of wildlife.Wild animals, mainly elephants, hesitate to use the traditional bio-corridor if there are obstructions. According to Ram, the increased human activities in the ongoing projects have halted the park animals from moving towards the east this year.Ram, who is also a PhD scholar on elephants, said elephants in the park generally move towards the east in May and June.“The tuskers used to reach the forest areas of Rautahat and Sarlahi by May and June. But this year, they have yet to reach the area,” said Ram. It is estimated that there are 35 to 40 wild elephants in the PNP.According to Ram, wild elephants travel through Jhapa and enter into Nepal from West Bengal and Assam in India each year. These animals reach Parsa district through the Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve that is spread in Sunsari, Saptari and Udayapur districts.But these animals have not arrived in Parsa this year.“Two-three elephants arrived in Sarlahi from the east about four months ago and wreaked havoc in the district. We believe that these animals returned to the east due to the ongoing construction works,” Ram said.According to Ram, there has been a limited movement of other wild animals like tigers, bears and blue bulls in the eastern part of the national park this year. Disruption of free animal movement will have a long term effect on their breeding, he said.","Published at : June 9, 2019",Parsa,Shankar Acharya

School holds mock election to educate pupils about voting process,"Most of the students heading to Bal Niketan Secondary School in Chandranigahapur of Rautahat district on Thursday morning were in for a surprise. There were polling booths and fences set up, enveloping the school in an atmosphere akin to that of an election day.After a while, the teachers came out and announced that this was indeed an election but one that would elect the school’s captains and vice-captains. The list of candidates was published and the students were asked to cast their votes for their candidate. The candidates were selected from grades 8-10 while students from grade 5-10—245 of them—took part in the election process.This was the first time a school in the district organised such an election. The initiative was an effort to educate their students about the election process, informed school Principal Brij Kishor Chaurasiya. The school administration had even named the parties and had followed due procedures to register the party including filing of nominations.“This was a new experience for us,” said Binu Darlami, who had stood and won the post of school captain. “Through this practical election we got to learn about the election process, filing of candidacy and also how to cast our vote.”","Published at : June 7, 2019",Rautahat,Shiva Puri
Elephant menace unabated in Saptari district,"The locals of Rupani Rural Municipality in Saptari were in abject terror when a herd of three wild tuskers entered the settlement on Friday evening. In their bid to chase away the marauding elephants, the locals made a fire and made noise but to no avail. Only when the police reached the settlement and fired four shots in the air did the elephants move to a nearby forest.“We tried to drive away the tuskers throughout the night, but were unsuccessful. We had to fire in the air to chase away the animals,” said SP Manoj Kumar Yadav.Elephant menace is a recurring problem in the northern part of Saptari district. The animals enter the settlements along the East-West Highway at night and wreak havoc, locals say.On Sunday night, a herd of wild elephants destroyed 10 houses in Shambhunath Municipality, Saptari. The animals destroyed food grains stored in the houses and damaged crops planted in fields, said police.Hareram Yadav, chief of the local unit, has demanded that the government should find a permanent solution to the problem.“We have repeatedly asked the local administration to control the elephants, but the authorities concerned have not paid any heed to the requests. The locals have to lose their lives and properties every year in elephant attacks,” said Hareram.Along with Rupani, many other local bodies in the district have been greatly affected by the tusker menace. The animal dismantled 34 houses and destroyed crops planted in hectares of land within the past three months in various places of Saptari district.The local people expressed their ire towards the governments, both provincial and federal, for not taking the problem seriously.“The problem cannot be solved at the local level due to a lack of necessary resources,” said Hareram, adding that he has also requested the provincial ministers and chief minister to control wild elephants in the district.“Elephants cannot be shot as per the existing legal provisions of the country. All we can do is relocate them. The district administration office has already informed the concerned authorities of the problem, and has urged them to take initiative to resolve the issue,” said Chief District Officer Surendra Poudel.As many as 75 people have been killed in elephant attacks in eight districts of Province 2 in the past 15 years. Seventeen people have lost their lives in Saptari alone.Assistant Conservation Officer Ashok Ram, who is also a PhD scholar on elephants, said there are around 234 wild elephants across the nation that frequently enter the settlements and wreak havoc. According to him, 43 wild elephants are in Parsa, six in Saptari and two in Bara.“The wild elephants enter into Nepal from West Bengal and Assam in India through Jhapa district. These animals reach Parsa district through the Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve that is spread in Sunsari, Saptari and Udayapur districts,” Ram said.Conservationists are of the opinion that the cases of human-elephant conflict are increasing mainly due to the encroachment of the animal’s habitat. According to Ram, an adult elephant needs about 150kg food and as many litres of water every day. They enter the settlements when they cannot find food and water in the forest, he said.","Published at : June 4, 2019",Rajbiraj,Abdhesh Kumar Jha

Sarlahi locals stage sit-in demanding re-evaluation of land compensation,"The local people of Bagmati, Hariaun and Lalbandi in Sarlahi district staged a sit-in in front of the District Administration Office on Thursday, demanding the authorities to re-evaluate the compensation amount fixed by the Compensation Fixation Committee of the East-West Electric Railway.The elected people’s representatives, including Mayor of Hariaun Municipality Ganesh Prasain, and local leaders of various political parties also took part in the sit-in protest.The protesting locals claimed that the Compensation Fixation Committee fixed the land’s valuation based on the ‘going rate’ 40 years ago.

State 2 nominated lawmakers warn of stern protest,"Lawmakers of Province 2 who were elected under the Proportional Representation (PR) have warned that they would obstruct the Provincial Assembly in light of the discrimination they have faced in budget allocation.Stating that the provincial government did not prioritise them while allocating budget in this fiscal, lawmakers said they will halt all provincial assembly meetings until the government revises its decision. They have demanded that the government provide equal status on par with their colleagues who were elected through the direct (FPTP) electoral process.Rina Yadav, a lawmaker from the Rastriya Janata Party-Nepal, said that they will start staging protests in the coming two days if the government does not revise the budget allocation.“The lawmakers elected through proportional representation will be compelled to stage demonstrations, as the government has been unfair to them in the allocation of budget,” she said.Lawmakers elected through the PR have only received Rs 2 million, whereas Rs 10 million has been deposited in the Constituency Area Development Fund.

Government says it will rebuild homes for windstorm victims before monsoon,"After days of the devastating windstorm that struck Bara and Parsa districts in the southern plains, the central government has said it will move ahead with the reconstruction of the affected areas trying to recover from the disaster.The Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Executive Committee meeting, chaired by Home Minister Ram Bahadur Thapa, on Friday reached a decision to immediately swing into the reconstruction phase.During the meeting, which was attended by ministry secretaries and focal persons of different humanitarian clusters, Thapa directed all the stakeholders to work in “integrated approach”, according to Bed Nidhi Khanal, chief of National Emergency Operation Centre.“The minister has instructed all the agencies to work in close coordination to implement the decision of providing survivors with settlements before monsoon,” Khanal told the Post.The responsibility of building new housing projects for the windstorm-affected families is being handed to the Army.Meanwhile, the government has started collecting on-the-ground details from the disaster-hit settlements.A meeting of various clusters on Wednesday evening analysed the situation so far on the ground after the deadly windstorm, the strongest ever recorded in the country’s history, that wreaked havoc in various parts of the two districts, claiming at least 28 lives and leaving thousands of people homeless.The meeting between focal persons on three clusters – logistics, nutrition and food and security – at the Home Ministry concluded that the situation has mostly returned to normalcy in majority of the places, according to Khanal, chief of the National Emergency Operation Centre.“We assessed the condition of various sectors or clusters and discussed how to move ahead to address the problems in these sectors,” Khanal told the Post. “For the early recovery and post-disaster recovery, we have completed the situation update.We also discussed how we can perform rest of the activities in coordination with all three tiers of the government.”The late evening windstorm that battered parts of 10 rural municipalities and municipalities in the two districts damaged 1,895 houses, forcing the disaster survivors of all ages to spend the first two nights under the open skies.Even though the cluster meeting concluded that there was enough logistics on the ground in the aftermath of the disaster, there was still a lack of temporary shelters and cooking utensils in the disaster-hit areas.“Besides the need of more tarpaulins and other items, there is a scarcity of lights as power supply is yet to resume because most of the electric poles were uprooted by the high-speed storm,” added Khanal.The meeting has decided to request the Ministry of Energy, Water Resources, and Irrigation to send 500 solar lights to the windstorm-affected areas. Likewise, the meeting has also requested UNICEF to send mosquito nets for the families in the two districts.Other UN agencies are already sending medical kits and other hygiene related items, according to Khanal. Health experts have warned that the disaster-affected areas has become prone to disease outbreak. Poor hygiene, scarcity of clean drinking water and hygienic food and sleeping outdoors might result in survivors contracting various diseases mostly water-borne diseases.“The nutrition cluster has thought of providing the survivors with vitamin supplements after inspecting them in the villages and also in the hospitals,” said Khanal. “The area does not have any shortage of food as edible items are being regularly distributed by various government and non-government agencies as well as clubs and individuals since the day the disaster struck.”“Food items are enough. The problem has been in management of food supply chain as even those not affected by disaster have queued up for relief materials meant for actual survivors.”","Published at : April 6, 2019",Kathmandu,Chandan Kumar Mandal
SEE exams in Province 2 suspended,"The government has decided to suspend tests of the remaining subjects under the Secondary Education Examination (SEE) examination in Province 2 in the wake of back-to-back question paper leaks.The Ministry of Education directed the Office of the Controller of Examination (OCE) to suspend the exams until further notice amid suspicion that papers of other subjects could have been leaked. The OCE board cancelled the test of social studies slated for Friday after confirming that the leaked question paper matched with the original.It had to cancel the examination for science on Thursday after the questions were leaked a day before the test. The back-to-back leaks of question papers, affecting thousands of students in eight districts, have raised questions over the security and management competency of the Central Examination Board. “The routine for the rest of the examinations will be announced within a few days,” said Minister for Education Giri Raj Mani Pokharel.The examination in other provinces will continue as per the schedule. The examination for Health and Population was slated for Saturday. With the new decision, except for compulsory English, Nepali and Mathematics, the students from eight districts in the province will take their examinations next month.A meeting of the security committee, tasked with maintaining the security during the examination, on Friday afternoon directed the examination management committee in all 77 districts to ensure confidentiality of the question papers. Based on the reports, the committee met again in the evening.“Though we received reports saying that the questions sheets were intact in the sealed envelopes across the nation, rumours of further leaks prompted us to suspend all the examinations,” Vishnu Prasad Adhikari, examination controller, told the Post.The question papers for both the subjects were circulated through social media from Saptari district. The examination for the science subject will be held on April 5 and social studies the next day. As many as 70,565 examinees are taking the tenth grade national examinations from 262 centres in the eight districts from the province. The examination controller’s office has fixed 1,969 examination centres across the nation and sealed question sets are kept in the police beats nearby respective centres. The sealed packets are opened just a few minutes before the examinations in the presence of superintendents and other police officials. Experts say this leaking of question papers is a case of sheer failure on the management’s part—from both the controller’s office and the security agencies.“This is also the result of giving unnecessary priority to the SEE exam. We have failed to give a message that the exam is like just any other exam,” said Bidhya Nath Koirala, a professor who has a deep understanding of the education system of the country. He says that due to the unnecessary pressure students feel because of the exams, they tend to resort to any means to get higher grades, which results in such incidents.  Koirala says that the concerned authority must investigate into the matter and try to find a long-term solution for such problems. Though there have been reports of question papers being leaked in the past, this is the first time the question sets of two subjects were leaked back-to-back.There are separate sets of question papers of the compulsory subjects in each province. The National Security Committee, formed to manage the SEE examination, therefore, decided to check the sealed packets of the question papers meant for all 1,969 centres in the presence of the chief district officer or in the presence of the officials designated by the CDO. The inquiry found that the rest of the questions papers are safe and sealed. The committee has also decided to deploy the Central Investigation Bureau of the Nepal Police to investigate how the question sets were leaked and who is responsible for it.“Currently we are not in a position to say who is behind this crime,” Vishnu Prasad Adhikari, the examination controller told the Post.  The Province 2 government, however, has taken the incident as an opportunity to attack the federal government. Its senior ministers have been blaming the centre for conspiring against federalism by tarnishing the image of the provincial governments. “I can tell you this is a well-orchestrated conspiracy by the federal government to tarnish our image. We will present the fact before the public,” Nawal Kishor Sah, Minister for Social Development, at the Province 2 told the Post over the phone.  He says had the provincial government been authorised to conduct the exam things would have been different. However, Koirala sees Sah’s claim as just an attempt to politicise the case. He says that though this is a result of the lapses on the part of federal government, there is no truth in saying that it is a conspiracy.“I have seen the exams of lower grades managed by local and Province 2 governments. They had completely failed to maintain the norms of the examination,” he told the Post.  Meanwhile, the SEE examinees from different districts in the province resorted to vandalism and sloganeering against the decision to cancel two examinations in as many days.","Published at : March 30, 2019",Kathmandu,Binod Ghimire
Holi was colourless and joyless for families of those martyred during the 2015 Madhes protests,"Ramjyoti Devi of Jagarnathpur in Birgunj-22, Parsa, did not celebrate Holi this year. In fact, she has not been celebrating the festival since her son died almost four years ago.  Every year, Ramjyoti spends Holi remembering her deceased son Dilip Chaurasiya. On August 31, 2015, Dilip was killed in police firing in Birgunj during the Madhes protest. Dilip, who was only 19, was an engineering student. “When I see his friends celebrate Holi, I am reminded of my son,” says Ramjyoti.After Dilip’s untimely death, the government provided Rs1 million as compensation to Ramjyoti’s family, but the money has done little to assuage the feeling of loss among the Chaurasiya family. “The compensation will not bring my son back,” she said, adding that her family is still reeling from the shock of Dilip’s death.The atmosphere at another martyr’s family home in Bhawanipur, Birgunj-22, is also that of gloom. Dharmaraj Singh was also killed in the police firing during the Madhes protest on September 1, 2015. Back then the people of Madhes were protesting against the proposed seven-state federal model.“We still can’t believe that our son is not with us anymore,” said Prabhu Singh, Dharmaraj’s father, talking about how he is reminded of his son’s absence especially around Holi.A team of social campaigners, including Prakash Tharu and Anishkant Kushwaha, have been meeting with the martyrs’ families every year during Holi and Chhath, and listening to their stories of pain. “We do what we can to help these families’ overcome their grief,” said Tharu.Three years ago, nine people in Parsa were declared martyrs after the Madhes protest.","Published at : March 23, 2019",Parsa,Shankar Acharya

He also spoke of his party’s decision to form an alliance with the parties having similar ideology. “We are going to unite all identity [-based] political forces and demonstrate against the court and the government,” said Mahato.“How can the court sentence a parliamentarian elected by the people to life imprisonment?” asked Mahato, adding that Chaudhary was jailed for his involvement in identity politics while former Maoist combatants, who killed thousands of people, go scot-free. “Was it only Resham who led protests in this country?”Mahato also criticised the government for not addressing the party’s demands including scrapping of political cases against its leaders and cadres involved in the Madhes movement.Mahato added that the RJP-N has started a discussion with the political forces that support the cause of identity for the planned protest. Mahendra Raya Yadav, coordinator of the RJP-N Presidium, said there was no alternative for the Madhes-based parties to uniting for a movement against the government.“The incumbent government is against identity politics.
