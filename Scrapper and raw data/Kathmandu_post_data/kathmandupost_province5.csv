Former Lumbini minister Yadav arrested on banking fraud charges,"Police have arrested Vijay Bahadur Yadav, former minister for land management, agriculture and cooperatives of Lumbini province, on the charge of banking fraud.According to Deputy Superintended of Police Shyamu Aryal, the former provincial minister was arrested from Duduwa Rural Municipality of Banke on Sunday.Aryal said Yadav is being brought to Rupandehi for further action.A court had issued an arrest warrant against Yadav in a fraud case after a bank refused to pay for a check bearing Rs1.2 million to Uma Shankar Yadav of Siyari Rural Municipality of Rupandehi for lack of sufficient balance in the bank account.Vijay served as the minister after he was elected to the provincial assembly from Banke-2 (a) from the Janata Samajbadi Party in the 2017 elections. The party later expelled him on the charge of working against the party. He then entered the CPN-UML ahead of last year’s polls and contested the elections.

Bridge construction in Jabdighat area left in limbo,"Construction of a new bridge at Jabdighat area in Bardiya—where an under construction bridge had caved in six years ago— is left in limbo due to budget uncertainty, leaving the local people into hardships.The authorities concerned are yet to release the budget required to construct the bridge over the Babai river despite the government’s repeated assurances. During his Bardiya visit on May 20, federal Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transportation Prakash Jwala had said that a tender bidding would be invited by mid-June. But the bridge construction process is yet to begin with the current fiscal year of 2022-23 is about to end.Sanjaya Gautam, who was elected to the House of Representatives from Bardiya-1, had staged a fast-unto-death strike under the damaged Jabdighat bridge from May 13 with 15-point demands including the immediate reconstruction of the bridge. The lawmaker ended his hunger strike with an agreement with Minister Jwala.“Around Rs1 billion budget is estimated to construct a new bridge of a tentative 400-metre length,” said Niraj Shakya, chief at the Division Road Office in Nepalgunj. “We sent a file to the finance minister a month ago to ensure a budget. However, the ministry has not yet released the budget.” Shakya added the office had already fixed the construction site of the new bridge that links ward 4 of Gulariya Municipality and ward 11 of Barbardiya Municipality.“The new bridge is already named Babai river bridge,” Shakya said. “Bridge construction will commence soon after the ministry approves the budget. It takes around six months for survey work and design. The bridge can be completed within two and half years.”The local people are hugely affected due to the delay in bridge construction. They vented their ire at the government for ignoring their problem. According to Phulpati Tharu of Padanaha in Barbardiya-4, the villagers could reach Gulariya, the district headquarters of Bardiya, within 15 minutes if the bridge was constructed in the Jabadighat area. “Now it takes nearly two hours to reach Gulariya now due to the lack of a bridge,” said Tharu, adding the bridge construction has been delayed due to the utter negligence of the government.A road was constructed from Rajanawa near Nepal-India border in Gulariya to link it with the East-West Highway through Barbardiya. The road was blacktopped a year ago. But the road is not fully utilised due to the lack of a bridge over the Babai river.“The local people have to face difficulties despite the construction of the road. The government should allocate a budget at the earliest to construct the bridge,” said Muktinath Yadav, mayor of Gulariya Municipality. According to him, around 150,000 people of Gulariya and Barbardiya municipalities have been directly affected due to the delay in constructing the bridge in Jabdighat area.The Puppu Construction had constructed the bridge along the Gulariya-Rammapur road linking northern Bardiya with the East-West Highway at an estimated cost of Rs166.8 million. The bridge had caved in due to floods triggered by incessant rainfall in August 2017 even before it was handed over to the government authorities. Two spans had caved in as the floods damaged two pillars of the 435-metre long bridge. Many suspect the bridge had suffered damage as the contractor had used substandard materials while constructing it.","Published at : July 16, 2023",Bardiya,Kamal Panthi

"Three children dead, one injured in landslide in Arghakhanchi","Three children of the same family died after being buried under a landslide early on Tuesday in ward 1 of the Panini Rural Municipality in Arghakhanchi. The children were aged 12, 11 and 10 years, according to Kamal Prasad Pokharel, ward 1 chairman of the rural municipality.Another 14-year-old, who sustained serious injuries, was rushed to Palpa for treatment, said Pokharel.All four children were buried in a landslide that swept away their house. They were rescued by the locals and police personnel, said Police Inspector Mukunda Rijal.Meanwhile in Panchthar in Koshi Province, floods and landslides have disrupted transportation along the Panchthar section of Tamor corridor and Mechi Highway. The rain-swollen Nawakhola river that flows along the border of Panchthar and Dhankuta districts swept away a tipper truck loaded with diesel barrels. Around 6,000 litres of diesel spilled into the stream, said police. Tipper driver Amrit Shrestha escaped unhurt.According to Police Inspector Diwas Kunwar, the water level in the Nawakhola River increased significantly as it has been raining heavily in the area since Monday evening. “Tamor corridor, Mechi Highway and almost all the rural roads in Panchthar have been disrupted due to the floods and landslides,” said Kunwar.The flooded Hewakhola had swept away a bridge on June 17 disrupting the Mechi Highway. The bridge has yet to be restored. Similarly, the Phidim-Taplejung road section of the Mechi Highway has been blocked again due to the rise in the water level in the Hewa river. The traffic had resumed on Monday after a diversion was constructed over the river.A flood had swept away the bridge over the river on June 18.Two weeks ago, more than 300 people from Yangwarak, Phalelung, Hilihang and Phidim in the district were displaced due to floods and landslides.","Published at : July 5, 2023",Arghakhanchi/panchthar,Birendra KC &

Artificial ponds provide relief to wildlife in Bardiya National Park,"Bardiya National Park has been replenishing artificial ponds built inside the park for wild animals to ensure the animals have access to water amid drying up of natural water bodies due to the hot summer.Bardiya National Park, one of the country’s major national parks in Tarai covering an area of 968 sq km, initiated the construction of artificial ponds some three decades ago to resolve the drinking water shortage for wildlife. Over the decades, the national park has constructed 180 artificial ponds, out of which 45 have water replenished throughout the year through solar-powered water pumps, according to Aashish Neupane, the information officer at the national park. The rest of the ponds rely on rainwater for replenishment.According to Ashok Bhandari, chief conservation officer at the Bardiya National Park, the park constructs five to six such ponds every year. “The construction of ponds and availability of water throughout the year have boosted the tiger population, their prey animals and other wildlife,” said Bhandari. “The availability of water ensures the wildlife don’t venture out of the forest areas in search of water and reduces human-animal conflict.”The artificial ponds are mainly constructed in grassland areas—Baghaura, Lamital and Lamkoili—far from the natural water sources. “We built artificial ponds this year as well. Most of the ponds were built in the Karnali floodplains and the Babai Valley this year. The national park has plans to build such ponds in Lami Damar, Guthi and Rambahara areas as well,” said Neupane.“Two major rivers—Karnali and Babai—pass through the national park, but they are far from the major habitats of wildlife so the ponds are concentrated in areas where the animals congregate.”Machans (platforms built on trees to observe animals), have also been constructed near the artificial ponds to promote wildlife tourism. “The animals come to the ponds to drink water providing some amazing opportunities for the tourists to watch and photograph them,” said Bhim Chaudhary, a nature guide from Thakurdwara area.The national park in April conducted a study to gauge the effectiveness of the artificial ponds in conservation efforts. Park employees and conservationists closely monitored the movement of wild animals that visited 20 artificial ponds. “They found many species of wildlife visiting the ponds for water. Tigers, spotted deer and elephants were regular visitors,” said Neupane. “Their frequent visits to the ponds indicate that the construction of artificial ponds inside the national park was and is a good call.” The artificial ponds are 50 metres to 100 metres long and about two metres deep. According to the park administration, it costs between Rs1.5 million and Rs1.7 million to build a pond depending on the geography. A pipe is bored around 100 metres underground to lift water. Various organisations working in the conservation sector including the Tarai Arc Landscape Project and National Trust for Nature Conservation provide financial and technical support to build these ponds.Tigers, elephants and rhinos leave the forests when water and prey are scarce, therefore it is imperative to prioritise the management of grasslands and water sources inside the national parks to avoid human-animal conflict, say conservationists.Bardiya is the largest national park in the Tarai and the second major habitat of tigers after the Chitwan National Park. Commending Bardiya National Park’s efforts towards ensuring the abundance of prey and water to the animals, Maheshwar Dhakal, director general of the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation, said, “The population of tigers has increased in Bardiya lately due to the management of grassland and water sources.” As per the latest tiger census, Nepal has a total of 355 tigers and 125 of them are in the Bardiya National Park.","Published at : June 26, 2023",Bardiya,Dipendra Baduwal &

Students protest demanding refund of additional charges,"Students at the Lumbini Medical College and Teaching Hospital in Palpa have been staging demonstrations for the past three days demanding refund of the additional charges levied on them by the institute.After the college administration ignored their repeated requests for reimbursement of the amount they were forced to pay as internship and additional charges, the students started a peaceful protest at the college premises.The tenth batch MBBS students of the Lumbini Medical College and Teaching Hospital, affiliated with Kathmandu University, have accused the college of disparity, claiming that they have been asked to pay unnecessary amounts.According to the students, the college has charged Rs200,000 as internship fees, Rs95,000 for ‘miscellaneous college expenses’, a service charge of Rs47,900 and other additional fees on various pretexts.“It is only our batch that has been asked to pay these unnecessary fees,” one of the students told the Post. “We repeatedly asked the administration to return the amount we paid even before the internship period. But our calls were not heard.”Kathmandu University begins internship courses from June 20 onwards for the students who have passed the examinations held in mid-March to early April. However, students at the Palpa-based college have refused to join.The additional fees paid by the students and basic allowance for internships should be made available during this period. The students accuse the college of not abiding by the regulations, instead, threatening them. “We have decided to not start our internships until our demands have been met,” another student said. “We will continue this protest until then.”Krishna Prasad Parajuli, company secretary of the medical college, claims that the students have been charged as per the regulations of the time. However, due to recent changes in the regulations, the newcomers have not been charged the same. “We have invited the students for dialogue, but no agreement has been reached,” Parajuli said. Parajuli added that the amount would be paid back to the students as basic remuneration at the end of the year.The medical students are paid Rs12,000 to Rs15,000 during their internship. Medical students nationwide have been put under similar conditions. By law, the colleges cannot charge the students more than Rs4.5 million, however, students complain that they have been compelled to pay over Rs6 million.","Published at : June 24, 2023",Palpa,Madhav Aryal

Community schools in Pyuthan Municipality blame downgrades and mergers for low enrolment,"Hari Prasad Thapaliya left no stone unturned to try and convince the Pyuthan-4 locals to admit their children to his school. The principal of Saraswati Basic School went door to door requesting the villagers to admit their children at his school. He even asked the seniors in the village to accompany him as he tried his best to convince the villagers.The Thapadanda-based school recorded no new admissions this academic session and is on the verge of closure due to a lack of students. The new academic session started on April 16 this year. Established in 2012, Saraswati Basic School has been facing a drop in student enrollment numbers for the past several years. Given the low enrollment rate, the Pyuthan Municipality downgraded the school that ran classes up to the fifth grade, to run classes up to the third grade only effective this academic session. Thapathaliya believes this could be one of the reasons why guardians have not sent their wards to his school. “Until last year, we used to run classes up to the fifth grade,” Thapaliya said. “This year, the municipality has allowed us to run classes only till the third grade.”Thapaliya claims that the municipality’s move to downgrade the school is the reason behind the lack of new enrollments this year. “We have been discussing merging with another school for a long time,” he said. “The guardians have failed to understand the reason behind the downgrade and they have been misinformed that the move was the result of poor quality of education at the school.” He shares that such misinformation has discouraged guardians from admitting their children to his school, and are instead opting for a different institute, mostly private schools.The school administration has taken multiple decisions on what the next move should be since there is not a single student enrolled this year. The administration is pulling out all stops to bring its former students back and to encourage new students to join the school. They have also announced that they will reimburse all the expenses guardians had to incur while enrolling their wards in other schools. “We will bear all the expenses if the students who have joined private institutes return to our school,” Thapaliya told the Post. “The admission fees paid to other schools, a year’s worth of books and stationeries and school uniform will be provided by the school.” Thapaliya shares that although the parents verbally agreed to send their children to his school, none have transferred their children from private to government schools yet. “Downgrading community schools and promoting private schools have posed a threat to community schools,” said Thapaliya.Bal Mandir Basic School, located in Ratamata of the Pyuthan Municipality-3, has also been downgraded from this academic session. The school had previously been running classes up to the fifth grade but now it runs classes only up to grade 3. “The educational landscape is the same. The number of schools, both government and private, increased but the number of students did not,” said Lok Bahadur Bista, the principal of the Pyuthan-3-based school. “Now they are harming community schools more by downgrading them.”In the previous academic session, the school had enrolled 45 new students in various grades. The number has plummeted to 14 this year. “We have five students at the child development centre [kindergarten], while we have nine students enrolled from grade 1 to 3,” Bista added.There are five community schools within a 2km radius in the area. Only one of the five schools in Pyuthan Municipality has an adequate number of students—Mukti Secondary School in Ratamata in Ward 3 has more than 600 students enrolled for this academic session. “The number of students in all community schools has been declining,” Bista said. “We cannot tell what the situation will be if this continues.”More than half-a-dozen schools in the Jhimruk Rural Municipality are also facing a decline in student numbers, shares the rural municipality vice-chair Pramod Pokharel. “We have been discussing school mergers,” Pokharel said. “In some schools, the number of teachers is more than that of the students. While in other schools, there is a lack of teachers. This has created a huge problem.”Even schools that were once performing well are on the verge of closure, he further added. “People have migrated from the villages. People are moving out of the villages with the purpose of educating their children in city schools,” said Pokharel. According to him, the women in the village migrate to the cities with their children as soon as their husbands travel abroad for work, causing a considerable decline in the number of students in the rural areas. To witness the closure of community schools is hard, says shares Pyuthan Ward -4 Chairman Resham Bahadur Karki. “Even the schools in urban areas of the municipality are facing such problems. It’s worse in the rural areas,” he said.The municipality’s education department head Basudev Bhattarai says they decided to downgrade some community schools so that the schools can improve the quality of education they can provide. “The local body has already instructed the community schools to improve their teaching standard,” said Bhattarai. “In the first phase, we have limited the number of classes they can run. We may have to merge some schools later.” As per a municipal education department’s report, increasing migration and a slowdown in the number of births, among others, are the main reasons for the problem. Pyuthan Municipality in coordination with the municipality's vice chair formed an education improvement committee and examined the schools. The number of students in privately-owned institutes in urban areas has been increasing while the opposite is true for community schools in rural areas, Bhattarai said.The students have increasingly been attracted towards private institutes due to the inability of the community schools to fulfil demands as per their needs, says Head of Education Development and Coordination Unit’s Pyuthan chapter Shiva Pandit. There are five private schools in Pyuthan Municipality.“There are no other options than to improve the standards of the community schools. Else, more schools will have to close their doors,” Pandit added. The closure of community schools in Thapadanda has become a major challenge for the school authorities while also acting as an example for institutes in other areas. The lack of a concrete academic plan in secondary-level schools also invited trouble, Pandit further says. In 2015, 10 community schools in Pyuthan were merged following a decline in student enrollment numbers. Millions of rupees worth of investments, that went into building the school infrastructure, went down the drain after closures, Pandit said. Currently, there are a total of 397 community schools in the district. “It is justified to merge those schools that face financial crunch or lack enough students,” he added “That responsibility has been handed to the local bodies now. Apart from closure and mergers, there are no other solutions to this problem.”","Published at : May 31, 2023",Pyuthan,Shamsher Bikram GC
East-West Highway obstructed as rain-swollen river washes away diversion,"A rain-swollen river washed away a diversion at Sunwal Municipality-1 of Nawalparasi West district on Thursday, obstructing traffic along the East-West Highway.Hundreds of people travelling along the highway have been stranded after a flood in Somanth river swept away the diversion constructed in the course of the ongoing Narayanghat-Butwal road expansion drive, according to Deputy Superintendent of Police Bhoj Raj Pandey.Authorities are having a hard time repairing the diversion due to continuous rainfall. The repair works will start once the water level in the river recedes.Police said the vehicles from the east have been diverted from Bhumahi to Bhairahawa and from the west to Parasi via Sunwal.The road expansion work along the Butwal- Narayanghat section of the highway has been snail-paced.The delayed road expansion work has caused hardship to travellers and locals. It generally takes two to three hours to cover the road stretch from Butwal to Narayanghat. But now the travel time has more than doubled since the road expansion project began in 2019.The widening work along the 114km section, one of the busiest road stretches along the east-west highway, was initiated with Rs17 billion loan assistance from the Asian Development Bank.","Published at : May 25, 2023",Nawalparasi West,Nabin Paudel
Police disrupt ‘psychic healing’ event in Tulsipur,"Police in Dang on Sunday disrupted an event organised by a self-proclaimed psychic healer Bharat Bhattarai. Bhattarai, who is from Lami in Pathari Shanishchare Municipality-7 of Morang district, became viral on social media for his purported ability to cure serious illnesses. Bhattarai identifies himself as astrologer Simanta KC.According to police, Deputy Superintendent of Police Rajan Kumar Gautam, chief of the District Police Office, the police stepped in to stop the event since the organisers had not obtained permission from the authorities for such an event.On Sunday, more than 300 people had gathered at the Trisiddheshwari Temple in Tulsipur Sub Metropolitan City for the event.“People had gathered in large numbers, lured by Bhattarai’s promise to cure them by simply touching them or looking at them,” said Gautam. “He was spreading misinformation in the name of curing people.” “The organisers had allegedly been deceiving people by telling them that Bhattarai can cure their ailments by simply touching their hands, face, or other body parts,” said Deputy Superintendent of Police Pushparaj Malla, who is also the chief of the Tulsipur Area Police Office. According to Malla, people had come from Salyan, Rolpa and Banke districts to attend the event. Some of the attendees had arrived in Tulsipur on Saturday and had been staying in hotels. “Scores of people bought the lie because they were desperate for a cure,” said Malla. Locals from Bhattarai’s native village Lami, say he has a history of defrauding people under various pretexts. “Bhattarai had previously served more than a year in jail after being charged with duping people under the pretext of sending them abroad on foreign employment,” said Khem Ale Magar, a local man. The locals say that Bhattarai’s father is also a shaman. But he is not in the best of health. Since May 10, when Bhattarai’s video where he claims to be ‘Simanta baba’ went viral on TikTok, his parents have locked up their home and gone elsewhere. After the police disrupted the Tulsipur event on Sunday, Bhattarai left for Nepalgunj, according to Gautam. In March, Bhattarai travelled to Pokhara where he organised a ‘health camp’ on March 6 at a resort in Powerhouse in Pokhara-17. In Pokhara, the local administration had also deployed two policemen for Bhattarai’s safety. Bhattarai’s Pokhara visit was arranged by Bharat KC, a member of the Pokhara Commerce and Industry Committee.The health camp, scheduled to run for three days, was disrupted after Bhattarai and KC were arrested on March 7 by a joint team from the District Administration Office, District Police Office, and District Health Office. The team conducted a search of the camp and confiscated Rs123,000 from Bhattarai.The search was carried out after a police case was filed against Bhattarai for illegally running the camp, said Assistant Chief of the District Office Gurudutta Dhakal. “They were collecting money from the visitors without issuing any receipts or maintaining financial records. They had charged Rs100 per head from 123 people,” Dhakal said. Binod Bhandari in Biratnagar and Deepak Pariyar in Pokhara contributed reporting.","Published at : May 24, 2023",Dang,Durgalal KC

Shahid Marga work in limbo,"The construction work on the Rukum section of the Shahid Marga Highway connecting Rolpa and Dang districts with East Rukum has been left in limbo.According to Shahid Marga Project Office in Libang, Rolpa, work has come to a standstill since the termination of the previous contract in December 2022.The 220km highway spans from Ghorahi in Dang district to Maikot in East Rukum, connecting three districts—Rukum East, Rolpa and Dang. Out of the 220 km, 74 km falls in Rukum East. Work on opening a 74 km passage from Dharmasala, Bhume Rural Municipality in Rolpa, to Hukam, Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality in East Rukum, has been completed. “But work on 12 km of the road is yet to be completed,” said Pawan Bhattarai, head of the road project.According to Bhattarai, the gravelling work on the Dharmasala-Mahat section has been completed. Even though the 6 km Mahat-Dumai section was also gravelled in the fiscal year 2017-18, the road suffered severe damage caused by a landslide in 2018. The road stretch since then has not been in use. “But we plan to open the road stretch soon after repairs. In the meantime, work on some sections of this project and the 38 km track opening of Kakri-Hukam have been completed,” said Bhattarai.The contract to upgrade and widen the Kakri-Hukam road section was given to Pappu-Koshi and Neupane JV in the fiscal year 2016-17, but the company failed to complete the work despite extending the deadline four times. The last deadline for the 38 km road ended in mid-October 2022. “The contract with the company was terminated for their failure to complete the project despite multiple deadline extensions,” said Bhattarai. “We received Rs95.5 million back from the company. They have been instructed to pay back the remaining Rs530 million to the project. But the remaining money is yet to be returned.”The project is now working on the detailed project report and environmental impact assessment. The construction work is only expected to start two years from now by a new contractor company.According to Puniraj Gharti, chairman of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, this project under the federal government did not go as planned due to the negligence of the contract company.The uncertainty of the project has deprived the locals of crucial transportation facilities, says Bharat Pun, a local of Maikot. “The project office estimates that the contract for opening the track in the Hukam-Maikot section is likely to start after two years,” Pun said. “During the construction of the road in this section, the old narrow dirt road was excavated in order to construct a wider road, but since there is no progress even after so many years, we have no access to motorable roads.”According to Bhattarai, the construction of three bridges also come under the project. So far, only the construction of one bridge is complete. The contract for two bridges over the Uttarganga and Ghattekhola rivers has been signed and the construction is expected to start in mid-September.“The construction of the Shahid Marga Highway, which was developed by the government as a part of the national road project to connect small roads to wider road networks failed to see completion,” said Gharti. “The project is in limbo and this has made life difficult for the locals. Without the construction of this road, folks in East Rukum will not be able to connect to the Mid-Hill Highway and other link roads. All levels of government must prioritise this project for the benefit of the locals and the entire region.”","Published at : May 18, 2023",Rukum East,Mahesh KC
4 succumb to forest fire injuries,"Four people died after sustaining injuries in a fire that broke out in a forest in Bhumikasthan Municipality ward 2 on Tuesday.Fifty-five-year-old Padam Belbase, 72-year-old Pitambar Belbase, 36-year-old Madhav Belbase and Ghanshyam Belbase, 52, of Dhakabang Jaithum village succumbed to injuries, said Inspector Krishna Ghimire, who is also the information officer at the District Police Office.Ashmita Belbase, 26, who also sustained injuries in the incident, is currently undergoing treatment at the Mission Hospital, Palpa. The hospital says she is out of danger.On Tuesday, a fire broke out in a forest near the Tirtire stream in Bhumikasthan ward 2. The locals had sustained severe burn injuries while trying to douse the flames after the inferno spread towards Padam’s house.All five injured were rushed to the Arghakhanchi Hospital for preliminary aid, following which they were admitted to the Palpa hospital.The four seriously injured—Padam, Pitambar, Madhav and Ghanashyam—were taken to Kirtipur Hospital. Padam and Pitambar died on the way to Kathmandu on Tuesday night while Madhav and Ghanashyam succumbed to injuries at 7am on Wednesday while undergoing treatment in Kirtipur, Ghimire added.Police suspect that the fire was a human error.According to Chief District Officer Mina Aryal, Pitambar’s wife, Nima, informed her that her husband had hurried to the forest area below their village immediately after the wildfire broke out. “She heard him scold someone for causing the fire,” said Aryal. “She said she could hear him shout at someone but by the time he ran towards the forest, flames had engulfed him. He warned everyone in the village about the approaching fire but could not save himself.”Nima has appealed to Aryal to take strong action against the person who caused the fire.The wildfire entered the settlement and destroyed Padam’s animal shed. The villagers gathered and saved other houses and sheds from being burned but they could not save four of their neighbours.“I was at the school when the incident happened,” said Bhim Lal Banjade, a local school teacher. “I rushed to the site upon seeing the flames. Five locals had collapsed before I reached there. We managed to stop the fire from spreading towards the settlement but could not save the injured.”According to Banjade, the fire spread in the pine forest in no time fuelled by dried leaves on the forest floor.The nearest forest office is the Division Forest Office in Sandhikharka, the district headquarters of Arghakhanchi, which is about 35 km away from the incident site. According to villagers, the fire broke out in the national forest for the first time in many years.Aryal, who is also the chief of the district natural disaster management committee, announced Rs50,000 each to the deceased’s family.“A detailed investigation into the matter is underway,” said Deputy Superintendent of Police Mukunda Rijal. “The person responsible for the bushfire will be brought to book soon.”Meanwhile, 11 people were injured, five seriously, in a forest fire at Malya community forest in Aathbis Municipality ward 6 of Dailekh district on Wednesday. According to Deputy Superintendent of Police Kishwor Lamsal, the critically injured victims were medevaced to Kohalpur, Banke, for treatment while others are receiving treatment at local health facilities.It is learnt that the victims were employed under the Prime Minister Employment Programme and were making a foot trail in the area when the fire broke out. They sustained burn injuries as they attempted to contain wildfire in the nearby community forest.","Published at : May 10, 2023",Arghakhanchi,Birendra KC

Blackbuck fawn deaths in Khairapur highlight conservation challenges,"One day some two weeks ago, two blackbuck fawns were rescued from a marauding jackal in the Khairapura-based blackbuck conservation area in Bardiya, western Nepal. Blackbuck (Antilope cervicapra), or Krishnasar as it is locally known, is an antelope native to India and Nepal. The fawns that had gotten a new lease on life were taken to the rescue centre. But the trouble had not ended for one of the rescued fawns; a few days ago, it had one of its eyes pecked away by a crow. On Friday, it died.The staff at the centre are now carefully watching over the remaining fawn. When they are alone, the fawns are attacked by jackals, hyenas, leopards and stray dogs. Protecting them from predators is a challenging task, says Aashish Tripathi, a ranger at the blackbuck conservation area.Female blackbucks generally live in groups to protect their fawns, Tripathi said. “And when they stray away from the group, they fall easy prey to other animals.”According to him, the birthing season for blackbucks is generally from mid-February to mid-April. Jackals, leopards, hyenas and stray dogs enter the conservation area during this time to attack vulnerable fawns, say conservationists.A week ago, the staff at the conservation area attempted to rescue a pregnant blackbuck while it was being taken away by a jackal. Unfortunately, the blackbuck died. Veterinarians conducted surgery and successfully took out two fawns from the mother’s womb but the fawns did not survive beyond three days.“We have been doing our best to protect the mother blackbucks and their fawns,” Tripathi said. “The staff try to smoke out jackals from their hiding holes but it still is not enough because we cannot keep track of jackals who enter the conservation area.”According to the blackbuck conservation area, a total of 32 blackbuck fawns were born in the past month. The number could rise as some blackbucks are pregnant. So far, 26 fawns have been killed by jackals inside the conservation area. As many as 11 male blackbucks were killed by leopards within the span of a week in August last year.There are currently 192 blackbucks in the conservation area. Last year’s count put the blackbuck population at 190 in the conservation area.The blackbuck population in the conservation area stood at 300 in 2014. Their number has declined over the years due to various challenges. Frequent attack by jackals, leopards and hyenas is the main challenge for blackbuck conservation.Blackbuck is listed as a near-threatened species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Efforts for blackbuck conservation began in Nepal in 1975 when a small herd was spotted in Khairapura in Bardiya district. On March 16, 2009, the government officially declared the area as ‘Blackbuck Conservation Area’, which spreads over 16.95 square kilometres of land in Gulariya Municipality Ward 2.Blackbuck conservation has not been effective due to a lack of regular patrolling of the conservation area, says Tanka Adhikari, a conservationist and ward chief of Gulariya Ward 2. “We must work towards the conservation of blackbucks since their number is dwindling,” he says. “We should build a strong fence to keep jackals, hyenas and stray dogs from entering the conservation area.”","Published at : April 12, 2023",Bardiya,Kamal Panthi

"Lumbini’s Buddhist meditation centre was built last year, but its roof is already leaking","Friday was a rainy day in Lumbini, the birthplace of Lord Buddha. Various parts of Nepal have been witnessing light, unseasonable rainfall for the past week or two but in Lumbini on Friday, it exceeded its usual density. Still, the day would have gone unremarked if it was not for reports that the International Buddhist Hall and Meditation Centre was deluged and close to flooding. The centre’s roof had leaked in the rain.This was unusual for a centre that was inaugurated less than a year ago, on May 16, 2022. The centre sprawls across an area of ​8,300 square metres, and leaks in not one, not two but 32 spots on the ceiling.Immediately upon getting information about the leaking roof on Friday, the Lumbini Development Trust’s board members, council members and technicians rushed to the site. The visiting team inspected the whole structure from the walls to the floor to the ceiling, according to Gopi Krishna Sharma, a member of the Trust’s council.“We found the roof was leaking in 32 places,” Sharma said, adding that they collected evidence of the contractor’s poor work and showed it to the Minister for Culture, Tourism, and Civil Aviation, Sudan Kirati. “Action will be taken against both contractors and consultants who have done such a shoddy job at such an important structure,” Sharma said. But this was hardly surprising for Sharma, who had received reports of the roof leaking just three months after the inauguration last year.The International Buddhist Hall and Meditation Centre is said to be a state-of-the-art facility, one that can host spiritual conferences, meetings, and meditation programmes, among others. It can host as many as 5,000 people. It has heating and cooling technology, sensor doors, a mosaic floor and speech translation facilities in 16 different languages. The umbrella-style roof was supposed to be made with soundproof and waterproof materials, according to Sharma.The construction was divided into two phases—the physical structure construction and its beautification. On March 20, 2018, an agreement was signed with Lumbini, Arghakhanchi Babul JV at Rs280.1 million for the first phase and Rs340.9 million for the second phase, according to Netra Shahi, a board member of the Lumbini Development Trust.But given what appears to be shoddy construction work, the Trust has withheld payment to the contractor, Shahi said.“We will withhold pay until they submit a report for this unacceptable construction work and fix the problem,” he said.Shahi says the shoddy construction work of the centre reflects poorly on the Trust and the overall master plan. “It is shameful,” he said. “This episode will send a negative message to the international community as well.”The centre was long in the making. Its construction falls under the Lumbini Development Master Plan. The Lumbini Development Trust, which is overseeing the implementation of the master plan, was established in 1985 to accelerate the work. The master plan, which the International Buddhist Hall and Meditation Centre is a part of, was designed by Kenzō Tange, an eminent Japanese architect, and was approved by the Nepal Government and the United Nations in 1978. The plan was supposed to be completed by 1995.On Buddha Jayanti in 2017, the then Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, who was attending an event, announced the construction of the centre and a year later, the then President Bidya Devi Bhandari laid the foundation stone of the centre.Meanwhile, the contractor company has deployed a team to identify structural issues with the centre. “The leakage might have occurred because the structure has not set in properly,” Santosh Adhikari, director of Lumbini, Arghakhanchi Babul JV, told the Post. “Technicians are working towards fixing the problem at the earliest.” The construction of the hall was completed in four years, a year more than the deadline. The main infrastructure work was completed in the first phase while the finishing and beautification works were completed in the second phase.The meditation centre stands on 140 piles of foundations constructed at a depth of 10 metres. The roof is supported by 40 pillars built on the foundation. A Chinese brick wall facade has been installed to keep the meeting hall closed from all sides. There are three main sensor doors—eight metres wide and two metres high—to enter the hall. There are also 52 manual doors—four metres high and two and a half metres wide. The hall has been constructed inside the land which is surrounded by a 38,000 square metres boundary wall.The second phase included finishing, colouring, and garden and canteen constructions. Three toilet blocks housing 28 toilets, including urinals and commodes, that can provide services to 25 people have also been constructed. Likewise, the installation work of the sound system has also been completed. As it is a place for meditation, the interior has completely been painted white with a yellow lotus painted on the ceiling of the hall. Similarly, 476 lights have been installed and a WiFi zone has also been created. Prahalad Yadav, a local man, says the shoddy construction work in the centre has dampened the spirit of the locals since they take this project as a pride project for the birthplace of Buddha. “The carelessness and negligence of the concerned authorities, stakeholders and contractors have led us all to this moment of embarrassment,” Yadav said. “It is the first hall in the country with state-of-the-art facilities. However, the leakage before the handing over of the hall shows carelessness and irresponsibility on the Trust’s part.”","Published at : April 5, 2023",Lumbini,Manoj Paudel

Villagers elated after local unit starts door-to-door health service,"Balaman Budha, a 63-year-old man from Pelma, Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality-2, is an asthma patient. He has been living with the condition for more than eight years.Despite his condition, Budha hardly visited the hospital for checkups since it required a day-long walk to reach the nearest health centre at Ward No 1 of the rural municipality. Risky foot trails and the expenses incurred during his visit to the health post deterred him from going for regular checkups, he says. But the launch of a health programme by the rural municipality wherein a team of health professionals visit people’s doors to provide medical services has come as a huge relief for Budha and many others like him.The rural municipality has deployed 14 auxiliary nurse midwives (ANM) in each ward of the rural municipality, mainly focusing on women, children, and the elderly.“Before the launch of the service, I used to suffer in silence and wait until it was absolutely necessary for me to go to the health centre,” said Budha. “Now health workers come around once a month and suggest when to visit the hospital, provide free medicine for simple illnesses, and teach us the importance of a healthy lifestyle. I finally see some positive changes in the neighbourhood. This programme may not be a big deal for everybody but for us, in the villages, it’s come as a boon.” According to Puniraj Gharti, chairman of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, in coordination with Taksera Basic Hospital in ward No 1, the medical personnel of the hospital have set a target to visit every house in the assigned ward once a month. “Also the medical team is on standby for house calls in case of emergency.”Our main priority has always been the development of the health sector in Putha Uttarganga. Other development activities can only be carried forward smoothly if the citizens are healthy,” said Gharti.The assigned ANM in their particular ward will check the health of the locals including the disabled, pregnant, and the newborn; test them for communicable and non-communicable diseases, measure malnutrition, administer medicines to chronic patients, and provide necessary consultation among other medical assistance.Milan Malla, medical officer of Taksera Basic Hospital said, “The ANM will also look for serious diseases among the population and ways to prevent them from getting worse. The local unit in collaboration with us is working on creating a health profile of every citizen so everyone can keep track of their health and help take preventive measures before problems become serious.” ANM Purnima Budha, assigned to ward No. 1, said that the door-to-door health checkup campaign has made people more aware about their health.“Every household welcomes us. At first, people used to feel shy about sharing their health conditions with us, but not anymore. They tell us about all their problems,” said Purnima.According to Manpura Budha, a 53-year-old woman of Putha Uttarganga-12, earlier she had to walk for more than a day on a risky foot trail to reach the nearest hospital. But now she is very happy with the launch of the door-to-door health service.“I have three sons, and all were born at home because, at that time, we didn’t know when was the right time to visit the hospital. I feel very happy to see the ANM giving advice to pregnant women and helping them during emergencies,” said Manpura.According to Bhupendra Budha, deputy chairman of the rural municipality, under the programme, people were also provided insurance by the local unit. “The aim is also to encourage pregnant women to opt for institutional delivery for the benefit of the mother and the child.”According to Taksera Basic Hospital, before the launch of the programme, only 40 percent of the pregnant women in the rural municipality would visit the hospital for delivery. “But things are gradually changing. We hope more pregnant women will come to the hospital for delivery. Through this programme we aim to raise awareness in rural areas about the benefits of opting for institutional birth,” said Malla, the medical officer.","Published at : March 15, 2023",East Rukum,Mahesh KC

14-year-old typhoid victim dies from alleged torture by faith healer in Rupandehi,"A 14-year-old girl from Sainamaina Municipality-10 of Rupandehi district died allegedly due to the excessive torture inflicted by a faith healer under the pretext of treating her.The girl who was suffering from typhoid and an ear ailment passed away during the ‘healing’ ritual conducted by the local faith healer named Soniya Reshmi on March 4. The incident came to light when a video of the brutal ritual where the girl can be seen in immense pain started circulating on social media. The District Police Office in Rupandehi issued a statement on Saturday stating that a detailed investigation is underway into the incident. “The accused faith healer, her mother and 15 others have been detained for investigation,” said Inspector Deepak Kunwar, the spokesperson of the district police office. The police are deeply concerned about the viral video showing physical torture being inflicted on the ailing girl, said Kunwar.The victim’s family took her to the faith healer on the evening of March 4 after her condition did not improve even after taking medicines from a local pharmacy and a hospital. The now widely-circulated video shows the faith healer, locally called Mata (mother), pulling the victim’s hair and knocking her down in the name of exorcising evil spirits from her body. The faith healer claimed a witch was behind the girl’s illness and failure to recover. “The faith healer first lit incense and threw rice grains on my daughter. She then poured cold water on her body and pulled her hair. She tortured my daughter. When we asked her to stop, she told us that my daughter will not feel the physical pain inflicted on her since the torture was aimed at a witch residing inside her,” said Lila Gyawali, the victim’s mother. She claimed that her daughter died due to the excessive torture by the faith healer.The victim was taken to the faith healer at around 8pm. She died a few hours later. The family members took the body home and performed the funeral rites the same night. “I recalled that my parents also used to take us to the faith healer when we fell ill. I initially thought that my daughter would be healed after the ritual,” said Gyawali. Gyawali’s brother took the video while the faith healer was ‘treating’ the ailing girl who was weak due to a long illness. The faith healer can be seen sitting on the victim’s back, pouring cold water on her head and continuously pulling her hair. The faith healer then knocks the girl down repeatedly and decrees her to get up. The victim’s mother can be seen standing near the door watching.According to the family members, the victim had gone to the local forest area with her neighbours to clear an irrigation channel at around 10am on February 24. But she returned home after three hours complaining that she had severe pain in one of her ears. “I took her to Hirachandra Hospital two days later as ear drops purchased from a local pharmacy did not work. We returned home with medicines. But she developed a fever that night. We visited a local clinic the next day. The blood test showed that she had typhoid,” said Gyawali.According to Gyawali, the girl would vomit after ingesting food and had become very feeble. “I called my husband who worked in a Bhairahawa-based factory and then we took our daughter to the faith healer,” said Gyawali. “I was unaware of the incident until I saw the video. Superstitions took the girl’s life. We could have rescued and saved the girl if we had known of the incident while it was happening,” said Krishna Prasad Ghimire, the ward chairman of Sainamaina-10.","Published at : March 13, 2023",Lumbini,Sanju Paudel
Residents deprived of timely services for lack of ward secretaries,"Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality in Rukum (East) has 14 wards, none of which has a ward secretary.The wards don’t have registration officers either, and in their absence, it’s the health workers of the nearby health institutions who are carrying out all vital registration work.The absence of ward secretaries and registration officers has deprived service seekers of timely and effective services and has also affected the daily workflow of the health workers, burdened as they are with additional roles.“The office assistants at the ward office arrange the necessary documents,” said Samir Giri, the information officer at the rural municipality. “They come to the designated registration officers with the collected documents to verify the vital registrations. The health workers have been given the responsibility for the vital registrations as only the permanent government employees can verify the government documents of vital registrations.”In Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, this is how things are since 2017 because the posts of ward secretary have remained vacant. According to existing legal provisions, vital documents could be verified by a Kharidar—a second-class non-gazetted officer—or a high-ranking government officer. Owing to the shortage of employees, the rural municipality has appointed employees on a contract basis but they are without the authority to verify the documents of vital registrations.Giri himself has been working as a registration officer for wards 1, 2, 3, 4 and 9. Giri is the chief of the rural municipality’s health unit.According to Harichandra BK, chief of the rural municipality’s administrative unit, Hemanta Budhathoki, the auxiliary health worker at Hukam Health Post, has been assigned the role of a registration officer for wards 5 and 6. Likewise, Om Prasad Chaudhary of Jangka Health Post is responsible for wards 7 and 8 while in charge of Taksera Health Post Birman Bohara for Wards 11 and 12.Similarly, auxiliary health worker Kalibhan Bista of the rural municipality’s health unit and in charge of Rangsi Health Post Saroj Kusiyat have additional responsibilities to verify documents of vital registrations for wards 13 and 14, respectively. The health workers who have to shoulder the additional administrative work complain that the responsibility has affected their regular work output. “We don’t have time to go to the ward office. The office assistants bring the documents to our workplaces and we verify them,” said Kalibhan.Wards 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8 and 9 do not have transportation services. The office assistants must walk for hours to reach the designated officer for the vital registrations. “We have been facing hardship for a lack of ward secretaries,” said Abhiman Nepali, the office assistant of ward 1. “We have to collect documents and go to the rural municipality’s office on a regular basis. It takes two days to go to the rural municipality office.”He also complained that the rural municipality does not provide any allowances for handling additional responsibilities.Balaman Budha, a resident of the rural municipality’s ward 2, says he had to wait for a long time to get his son’s passport issued. He said he visited the ward office a few months ago to get a recommendation for his son’s passport. “We had to wait for a week to get the recommendation as the office assistant had to take the document to the designated registration officer before anything could be processed,” he said.","Published at : March 12, 2023",Rukum (east),Mahesh KC

"Beset by poverty at home, Banke women face horror abroad","For the past month, Pramila Baidar’s husband, Resham Baidar, has been making rounds of various government offices, requesting officials to help him repatriate his ailing wife from Oman. Every time, he has returned disappointed.“None of the authorities have helped me,” Resham laments, adding that he was in the hospital when his wife left for Oman without informing him four months ago. “She didn’t share her travel plans with anyone in the family fearing we would stop her. She contacted us only when she was taken ill. She needs immediate medical attention and we need to bring her back.”Pramila, 41, was diagnosed with intestinal cancer a couple of months before she left for the Gulf nation through illegal channels to work there.The debt burden accumulated during her preliminary treatment is what forced her to make the risky move, says Ajaya Baidar, Pramila’s brother. Since Resham also hasn’t been keeping well for the last few years, the responsibility of caring for him and their two children had fallen solely on Pramila’s shoulders. She took out a loan from a local cooperative last year to cover treatment costs and living expenses. The cooperative threatened Pramila with legal consequences for defaulting on the loan. That was when her neighbour, Rahul Shahi BK, suggested she go aboard to earn money. BK assured her that if she went to Oman, she would get treated for cancer and post recovery, he would arrange a job for her as a domestic help.“The prospect of getting treated and even earning money was alluring for Pramila,” said Ajaya. “But for the past three months, she has been held hostage in Oman. She contacted me a couple of days ago and told me that the ones holding her have asked her to pay Rs350,000 if she wants to go home. We can’t afford to send the money for her release.”Pramila flew to Oman from Delhi on November 3 last year. Upon reaching Oman, her health condition worsened, and she frequently lost consciousness. However, instead of providing the promised medical treatment, she was asked to return the money the agents had spent on her travel and stay in Oman. Pramila is a resident of Pitmari, a squatter settlement in Baijanath Rural Municipality, Banke. The settlement is home to around 600 Dalit families. Most of the families are surviving on loans from local cooperatives and loan sharks. As unemployment is rife for a lack of income earning avenues, several women and girls find their way to Gulf nations through unreliable sources running illegal channels.These days, Pitmari is almost empty of womenfolk, says Prakash Bahadur Shahi, chairman of the local unit. “We are running awareness campaigns in settlements like Pitmari so they understand the risk of moving abroad through illegal channels,” said Shahi. “But as they go through illegal channels their families approach us only after the women reach the host countries and fall into an agent’s trap. It becomes very difficult to rescue them.”The rural municipality is currently collecting data on the exact number of women and girls who have left for Gulf countries and are being held captive. “We are also taking initiatives to bring this growing issue to the notice of the authorities concerned,” Shahi said.Following several cases of exploitation, the government had prohibited women from going abroad for domestic work in 2017. The ban has been lifted and reimposed multiple times.Currently, the government has restricted women domestic workers from going to work in nine Gulf countries—Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Bahrain, Iraq, Libya and Lebanon.Asha Pariyar, a 42-year-old woman from Pitmari, left for Kuwait two months ago and is currently being held captive by local agents, according to her family. Asha too had taken out a loan of Rs500,000 from a cooperative but had defaulted on her monthly instalments.Sapana Pariyar, Asha’s 20-year-old daughter, said her mother saw no recourse to paying the loan than to go to Kuwait. Asha applied for her passport and went to Kathmandu to collect it in August 2022. Asha’s husband works in India so she left her two children in Sapana’s care. She got a job as a domestic help in Kuwait but she was soon fired. “Since then she has been trying to return to Nepal,” Sapana says. “But the agent has kept her holed up in a room and refused to let her go until she pays for the expenses incurred so far and for her flight back home.”The family is in no condition to send any money to bring Asha back home from Kuwait, says Sapana. “We can’t even borrow as we already have so much debt to clear.”Sita BK also went to Kuwait a month ago and has been held captive there, according to Sita’s husband, Raju BK. A daily wage worker, Raju says it was getting difficult to put food on the table, especially after the birth of their son.“Financially, we were stretched thin,” Raju says. “We were struggling when an agent came to us and told us of the benefits of going abroad to earn money.” The agent told them they would be able to secure the future of the newborn, so Sita was tempted.Things haven’t gone as planned. While in Kuwait, Sita suffered from bouts of weakness which hampered her output at her job, prompting her employer to fire her. “She’s now being held in a room and the agent is putting pressure on us to send Rs250,000 if we want her to return home,” Raju says. “I don’t know what to do now.”Kamala Pant, a human rights activist, says that since there is no state mechanism to inform citizens of the pitfalls of using illegal channels to venture abroad, women from poor backgrounds in Banke, most of them Dalits, have been risking their lives to go to the Gulf nations.While some women have been able to inform their families back home about their predicament, most others have not. Those who do not know how to use or access technology are completely cut off from their families back home. Pant says that many women, especially those from poor and marginalised backgrounds, move abroad with little to no knowledge about the country they are going to or the jobs they will be assigned to. “Once they reach there, their fates are sealed,” she says. “Only very few lucky ones get to realise their dreams while the others get trapped.”To curb this phenomenon, the government should raise awareness on the perils of going abroad through illegal channels, bring the local agents to book, and create job opportunities for the poor and uneducated women in the country itself, Pant suggests.Top Bahadur KC, Banke’s assistant chief district officer, blames lack of proper policies and laws to help those who leave the country using illegal channels for the plight of women stranded abroad. Searching and rescuing Nepali women held captive in foreign countries is the responsibility of the federal government, KC says. “But the same service is not extended to those who leave through illegal channels,” he says. “It’s difficult to track those women as the government does not have any leads on them.”Today, Pramila’s husband, Resham, is scrambling to bring his wife back home. Seeking help, he has visited the Ministry of Labour, Department of Labour and Foreign Employment and Department of Immigration in Kathmandu and various social organisations.He has even filed a complaint with the Kohalpur Police Station after he got a call from Pramila. But the local agent, who goes by the name Rahul, is absconding and they have no other lead, Resham says, adding he is losing hope of seeing his wife again. “They [the police] said they will contact me if they make any progress but now it’s been more than three months,” he says. “I am extremely worried about my wife.”","Published at : March 2, 2023",Banke,Rupa Gahatraj

Healthy youth presence perks up Lumbini Provincial Assembly,"Anurag Khadka returned to Nepal from the United Kingdom after completing his Bachelor’s in Business Administration degree last year. He was 27.Unlike many of his contemporaries who stayed back in the UK or moved to another country, Khadka decided to return home in Dang with a single purpose. He wanted to enter politics. Khadka became a Mahasamiti member of the Nepali Congress upon his return and contested the provincial election held on November 20 last year.Khadka was elected to the Lumbini province assembly from Dang Constituency No 1 (b) at the age of 28, becoming the youngest member in the 87-strong assembly.The young provincial lawmaker wants to use his education and experience to focus on health, education, commercialisation of agriculture and infrastructure development.“When I went canvassing for votes, most people complained that people’s representatives forget about them after winning polls,” Khadka said. “So I’ve made it a point to meet people on a regular basis and listen to their grievances. I will take their issues to the government and work towards finding solutions.”Khadka is the son of the late Congress leader Khum Bahadur Khadka.Twenty-nine-year-old Ambika Kafle was elected to the provincial assembly under the proportional representation system. A permanent resident of Nepalgunj Sub-metropolis-13 in Banke district, she was elected a central member of Janata Samajbadi Party, its Lumbini provincial treasurer and Banke chief of the inter-party women’s network before becoming a provincial assembly member. Kafle says work in the social service sector gave her an insight into the importance of youth in politics. “I used to work with a cooperative. Then I joined Manabata Nepal, a social organisation that provides humanitarian assistance to the poor and helpless people,” said Kafle. “During my affiliation with the organisation, I realised that a lot of work remains to be done in the field of gender equality and youth empowerment. I joined politics with the hope of making significant changes in the system while being a part of it.”Lumbini Province is seeing a rise in the number of interested youths stepping into politics which has so far been the playground of the old gatekeepers. There are as many as 26 members below 40 years in the Lumbini assembly currently. Only nine youths from this age group were in the last provincial assembly. Congress leader Basiuddan Khan, 39, and Loktantrik Samajbadi Party’s Santosh Kumar Pandey, 39, have been re-elected to the assembly. Both of them served as ministers.The youths’ involvement in politics in increasing numbers comes as a breath of fresh air, says Dil Sahani, a writer and political analyst. He, however, cautions the young leaders about the challenges they will face in their journey. He suggests that young leaders should rise above the party limits and execute result-oriented work that stands to benefit society. “The government, provincial assembly and the parties are largely dominated by the senior people. It is not easy for the youths to work under their leadership,” said Sahani. “It will be a challenge to find common ground with established politicians but the youth representatives should find ways to work together with the older politicians to uplift the situation of the common people.”The elected youths are committed to working to address public aspirations, says 30-year-old Chandrakesh Gupta. He is a Janamat Party minister in Lumbini Province.Gupta, elected from Rupandehi Constituency No 5 (b), has been leading the Ministry of Social Development. “I strongly lobbied for the social development ministry to combat illiteracy, inequality, social evils, and class and caste discrimination prevalent in the Tarai region,” he said. “My core area of focus is transformation through social development.”Gupta says he has prioritised solving the fertiliser problem faced by the farmers; reducing the mortality rate in pregnant women due to the lack of specialist health services; and ensuring no child in rural areas drops out of school.“Development of society is directly related to the development experienced by the people at the grassroots level,” he said. “I will focus on development where it matters the most.”The young members of the Lumbini provincial assembly are committed to transforming the economic, social, cultural and political realities of the province. All of them have prioritised good governance, employment and practical education.Raj Kumar Chaudhary, aged 31, was elected from Bardiya 1 (b). He is the central member of Nagarik Unmukti Party and the party’s chief whip in the provincial assembly. Justice and identity are his main agendas.“Tharus are indigenous to Madhesh. But they are deprived of their rights and identity. They are landless despite living here for generations. Their identity and justice are my main agendas,” he said. “Youth unemployment gives rise to violence and crime. I will try my best to create jobs for them.” Nori Kumari Chaudhary, 32, and Dharma Bahadur Chaudhary, 36, are two other lawmakers from the Nagarik Unmukti Party.Some of those 26 assembly members below 40 years have worked with the sister organisations of their parties while a few others, mainly those elected under the proportional representation system, were actively involved in various social campaigns. Sayara Bano, 34, is the only woman representing the Muslim community in the Lumbini assembly. She was elected a CPN-UML member under the proportional representation system. Bano, who holds a Master’s in Sociology, was actively involved in social campaigns for the rights of Madheshis as well as Muslim communities with special focus on women.“I will raise my voice for the rights, education and overall change of the situation of those communities,” Sayara said. “Ending gender violence and bringing Madrassas into the mainstream of education is also my priority.”The increasing number of youths in the provincial assembly is taken as a positive sign in Nepali politics.“Youths have the power to change the country’s face through constructive works. Just being young does not mean you become a changemaker though,” said Lila Giri, the chief minister of Lumbini Province. “Their deeds should justify their energy and enthusiasm.”The participation of youth in politics has added vibrancy to the provincial assembly, according to Speaker Tularam Gharti Magar. “Their participation and concerns seen in the initial meetings of the assembly show they are assertive and result-oriented,” said Gharti Magar. “I hope to see their work next.”","Published at : February 20, 2023",Butwal,Amrita Anmol

Children with absent fathers struggle for citizenship,"Fifty-two-year old Kausalya Devi Budhathoki finds herself at a crossroads yet again. The challenges life has thrown at her have only gotten more difficult, she says. But never has she faced a greater challenge than trying to acquire citizenship for her two daughters with an absent father.When she was a young woman, 23 years ago, she married a man against the wishes of her family and that of her husband’s. Budhathoki, originally from Nepalgunj, set out to start a new life in Kathmandu with her husband, Lal Bahadur Shah. She opened a small eatery in Thankot, on the outskirts of Kathmandu, while Shah worked as a contractor on construction sites.The couple soon had a daughter.As the daughter grew up, Shah became more distant, recalls Budhathoki.Two years later, she moved to Surkhet as her business in Thankot was failing, and there, she gave birth to another daughter. She had expected the birth of a second child would keep her husband from wandering but that was not to be.“We had been living in Surkhet for about a year when my older daughter started having health issues,” said Budhathoki. “She had fractured her hand when she was little and now the old wound was giving her trouble. The doctors in Surkhet suggested we take her to Nepalgunj for surgery.”On the day of the surgery, her husband asked her to wait at the hospital in Nepalgunj while he made arrangements for money. “He left us there and went out,” Budhathoki said. “That was the last I saw of him. He never returned.”After her daughter’s surgery for which she managed to pay for herself, Budhathoki went around looking for her husband. She called her husband’s friends, family and relatives in the hopes of knowing his whereabouts. Failing to locate him after multiple tries, Budhathoki gave up. She could not file a missing person’s report with the police since she did not have any supporting documents or his photograph to show to the police.This incident happened 14 years ago. Since then, Budhathoki has been living in Nepalgunj with her daughters, who are now 21 and 19 years old. “My older daughter, Swechchha, was seven years old and my younger daughter Shreya was four-and-a-half when their father left us,” said Budhathoki. “Since then I have been fighting a lonely battle to raise my daughters and to get them recognised as Nepali citizens in the eyes of the law.”Swechchha, who is pursuing a BBS degree, is getting ready to step out into the world but the lack of her citizenship certificate has clipped her wings.“I raised my daughters as a single mother. I hope for a good life for them, different from the one I had myself,” said Budhathoki. “But when the district administration officials in Banke sent us away asking us to return to the office with their father’s documents, I lost all hope.”Budhathoki has not heard from her husband in more than 14 years and does not have any information on him to be able to track him. It has been five years since her first visit to the District Administration Office trying to acquire citizenship for her daughters through her name. “I acquired my citizenship certificate about six years ago through my parents. My citizenship is based on descent which should qualify my daughters to acquire their citizenship.”She has visited the District Administration Office and the district court several times but has been turned away every time.Nepalgunj Sub-metropolitan City had written a recommendation letter to the District Administration Office for Budhathoki during her first visit to the office. But the officials there did not think much of the recommendation.Budhathoki then went to the Banke District Court last year seeking citizenship status for her older daughter through her name. The court passed a verdict in her favour and directed the District Administration Office to issue Swechchha her citizenship.But the District Administration Office did not implement the court order.Budhathoki says she presented her documents to the District Administration Office, but was still refused.Budhathoki owns a small vegetable shop in Nepalgunj. Both her daughters help her run the shop which allows the family to meet their growing expenses. Swechchha is eager to work and support the family, but she hasn’t been able to land a job for lack of a citizenship certificate.She remembers very little of her absent father. He is but a name that she often forgets. “I remember only glimpses of my father. My mother is the one who gave birth to us and raised us. I have seen her work very hard my whole life to put food on the table and pay for our education,” said Swechchha. “All I want to do now is take care of her. Give her some rest, but I can’t do anything until I have my citizenship certificate.”Swechchha added, “Although the constitution guarantees that a child can acquire citizenship through their mother, the authorities are denying me my right.” Article 11 (2) (b) of the Constitution of Nepal states that if a person whose father or mother was a citizen of Nepal at his or her birth, the offspring will get Nepali citizenship on the basis of any of their descendants when they reach the legal age.Section 3 of the Nepali Citizenship Act, 2063, provides that when a person’s father or mother is a Nepali citizen, such a person will become a Nepali citizen by descent.A single mother can pass on citizenship by descent to her child, provided the father’s identity is unknown.The younger daughter, Shreya, who is about to finish high school, dreams of going abroad, but the lack of citizenship has compelled her to stay put.“The administration always makes us feel that there is no value to my mother,” she said. “Our mother did everything for us, from protecting us to educating us. But in the eyes of the law of this country, she is a non-entity.”Bishwajit Tiwari, a lawyer based in Nepalgunj, said that the constitution has the provision to grant citizenship to children in the mother’s name, but the decision has not come into effect. “The children whose father abandoned them or went missing face more difficulties than others,” he said.According to the District Administration Office, although there is a provision for children to acquire citizenship through their mother in the Constitution of Nepal, the office cannot issue citizenship because laws and policies in this regard are yet to be formulated.An amendment to the Citizenship Act 2006 has been deemed necessary to make it compatible with the constitution. However, due to differences among political parties, a planned amendment remains stalled since August 2018, when a bill to revise the Act was first registered in Parliament. As the then State Affairs Committee of the then House of Representatives couldn’t forge consensus among parties on the bill despite discussing it for over two years, the government on July 9, last year withdrew the bill and registered a new one, which was endorsed by the lower house on July 22 last year and subsequently by the upper house and was forwarded to the President.The President, however, returned the bill requesting Parliament to revise some of the provisions. But Parliament again sent the bill back to the President without any revision and she sat on the bill and allowed it to lapse. The bill, however, did not address the issue of the status of children with single mothers and absent fathers.When it comes to the provision for women to pass on citizenship by descent to their children in cases of absent fathers, the District Administration Office says its hands are tied. Budhathoki must be able to furnish proof of her children’s father being a Nepali citizen, according to Hari Prasad Sharma, assistant chief district officer and information officer for the District Administration Office, Banke. “Citizenship issued by the nation for the identification of its citizens is important. Citizenship can be obtained by descent through the mother’s identity but the current law requires the applicant to furnish proof of the father’s identity as a Nepali,” said Sharma. “Therefore, it is necessary to address this issue in the new law. Until then, there is not much we can do about Budhathoki’s case.”In the first week of February, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal held a meeting with chief whips of all major parties wherein they all are said to have agreed to move forward important bills including the citizenship bill.While seeking a vote of confidence on January 10 in Parliament, the prime minister had promised to endorse the citizenship bill within six months.“The government must do what’s necessary for people like us who are cornered from all sides,” Budhathoki said. “The unequal citizenship laws do not allow for the transfer of citizenship to children through their mothers alone. But how long do my daughters have to wait before the government deems it the right time to address our issues?”","Published at : February 15, 2023",Nepalgunj,Rupa Gahatraj

"In Jagadishpur, migratory birds decline for 3 consecutive years","Conservationists are worried about the continuous decline of aquatic bird population in Jagadishpur lake, a bird sanctuary which is a major habitat of winter migratory birds, for three consecutive years.The fresh bird count conducted last week showed that the population of both the migratory water birds and bird species have decreased in Jagadishpur, a Ramsar wetland site.“The decline in the migratory bird population in Jagadishpur is quite worrisome,” said Hem Sagar Baral, a senior ornithologist. “Obviously, there are problems behind the gradual decline of the bird population. Study is underway regarding the decreasing bird population in Jagadishpur.”According to ornithologists, around four percent of the bird population has decreased in Jagadishpur lake in 2023. A total of 9,487 birds were counted during the latest bird count. The population of migratory aquatic birds stood at 9,837 and 12,063 in 2022 and 2021, respectively.The number of migratory birds saw an increase to 20,807 in 2020 from 14,980 recorded in the previous year.A team of ornithologists including Baral, Tika Giri, DB Chaudhary and Dhiraj Chaudhary conducted the bird count in Jagadishpur lake on Monday. The count was held by a direct method of bird count by dividing the lake into various areas. According to the ornithologists, they use telescopes, binoculars, GPS, sound recorders and cameras to count the birds.Jagadishpur lake, which was constructed in 1972-1973 for the purpose of irrigation, has been a major destination for bird watching in the country. It is the biggest shelter, according to the conservationists, for migratory birds.According to Giri, a total of 49 species of aquatic birds were recorded in 2022. “Only 45 species of birds have been found in the lake this year,” he said.Despite the fall in bird population, ornithologists are elated to spot some rare bird species in good numbers. “We spotted two Falcated ducks, locally called Phurke Hans, during the count,” DB Chaudhary said. “It is a very rare bird species in Nepal. Both the Falcated ducks were male. So we believe that there could be other female birds of the same species.”According to him, around six or seven Falcated ducks migrate to Nepal from Siberia during winter. One Falcated duck was spotted in Barju lake of Sunsari district as well. Nearly 100 Common pochards, another globally endangered bird species, were also found in the lake.Jagadishpur has the highest number of Common coot with 4,095, followed by Red-crested pochard at 1,930. A total of 930 Common teal, 640 Lesser whistling duck, 446 Little cormorant and 300 Great cormorant were recorded in the fresh count of water birds in Jagadishpur.Jagadishpur lake, which was listed as a Ramsar wetland site in 2003, was declared a bird sanctuary, the country’s second, in July last year. The lake is spread over an area of 157 hectares across Kapilvastu Municipality’s wards 9 and 10, and is located some 11 kilometres north of Taulihawa, the district headquarters of Kapilvastu.Every winter, birds migrate to the lake from Siberia, China, Mongolia, Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan and stay until February. Gadwall, Lesser whistling duck, Tufted duck, Ferruginous duck, Northern pintail, Northern shoveler, Eurasian wigeon, Common Pochard and Cotton pygmy-goose are the major birds found in the lake.Jagadishpur lake is a major destination of birding in Nepal. Conservationists warn that the lake will soon lose its fame if the bird population continues decreasing every year. According to them, human encroachment is the main threat for bird conservation in the lake.“It is not good that human activities are increasing in the lake,” Baral said. “Jagadishpur lake has become unsafe for birds due to increasing human activities and encroachments in the lake.”Five boats are operated in the lake for the visitors. “The visitors tease and attempt to catch birds,” Baral added. “It is not good for bird conservation.”","Published at : February 3, 2023",Kapilvastu,Manoj Paudel

"Health workers visit new mothers, pregnant women at doorsteps with services","In an effort to reduce maternal and infant mortality rates in the local unit, Arghakhanchi’s Sitganga Municipality has initiated free door-to-door medical check-ups for pregnant women The programme kicked off on January 3 and aims to cover the nooks and crannies of one of the largest local units in the country in terms of area coverage.“Some of the wards of the municipality are located in geographically remote areas and not all wards are connected to road networks,” said Gita Bhat, deputy mayor of the municipality. “Most women are deprived of medical care because there are no proper health services in the villages.”One of the beneficiaries of the service, Saraswati Poudel of Suwarnakhal in ward 1, is eight months pregnant. Health workers accompanied by the people’s representatives of her ward showed up at her door last week.“I was surprised and very happy to see them. They ran tests and did an ultrasound,” said Poudel. “The doctor advised me on the importance of a balanced diet, safe pregnancy procedures, safe childbirth, and how to take care of the baby after delivery. This is my first experience receiving health services at home.”Earlier, she visited Butwal once and the local health post four times for a health check-up during pregnancy. According to her, most women from her village do not go to the hospital for health examinations due to poverty.“I have spent so much money on tests, checkups, and consultants so far,” she said. “So this service has come as a relief to me and other women in the village.”A health team from Thada Primary Health Centre in ward 3 of the municipality comprising Dr Suvekcha Sharma, nurse Sirjana Ghimire, and health workers Damodar Dhakal and Laxman Pandey have been visiting the villages gathering information on pregnant women and providing them with medical services.There are 14 wards in the municipality, and so far the team has examined 14 pregnant women in ward 1; 23 in ward 2; 11 in ward 4; 13 in ward 5; 27 in ward 6; 17 in ward 7; 13 in ward 8; 11 in ward 9; and 18 in ward 10.“We check the health of the pregnant women and the fetus, and give advice on nutrition and conduct a video x-ray,” said Ghimire. “We will follow up with them every three months. Before this programme was launched, pregnant women were obligated to go to Butwal for a health check-up from a specialist doctor.”According to Ghimire, the health team has also briefed pregnant women on the importance of physical exercise during and after pregnancy and has asked them to avoid junk food.“Women in poor financial condition cannot afford to visit the hospital for follow-up checkups, which increases the risk for both mother and child,” said Bhat, the deputy mayor. “The municipality has allocated a budget for this programme and plans to give continuity to it.”","Published at : January 16, 2023",Arghakhanchi,Birendra KC

Pyuthan villagers relieved as health post upgrades services,"After his eight-month-old daughter suddenly fell ill last week, Hari Prasad Paudel of Baireni in Pyuthan’s Airawati Rural Municipality-6 rushed to Puranthanti Health Post. Paudel did not hope that he would get quality service at the health post for his daughter, who suffered from high fever. After all, Paudel had often heard that patients were deprived of treatment due to the lack of doctors even in the district hospital. So, when he knew there was an MBBS doctor at Puranthanti, he was surprised.“At first, I did not believe that the rural health post had a MBBS doctor,” Paudel said. “I believed it only after the doctor treated my pneumonia-stricken daughter.” Now his daughter is gradually recovering from the illness as Dr Amit Pandey, posted at the health post, diagnosed the disease and provided treatment accordingly.If not for Pandey’s posting at the health post, Paudel—and many like him in Airawani—would be forced to travel to the district hospital in Bijuwar, which lies some 32 kilometres from Puranthanti, for quality health service. Ever since the health post recruited Dr Pandey, service seekers in this rustic local unit have been spared of all the hassle and desperation of having to travel such a long distance. The move might have even averted a tragedy or two.The local residents are obviously happy and relieved. “Gone are the days when the villagers had to die in need of treatment,” Muna Rawal, a local, said. “Pregnant women are hugely benefited as ultrasound facilities are available along with laboratory services. The villagers could save much of their time and money.”Some of the prominent new services available at the health post—supported by the rural municipality—now include X-ray, ultrasound, laboratory, and electrocardiogram.Moreover, the health post provides round the clock service, according to Dr Pandey. He added he and his team try their best to provide quality health services to the 50 to 60 patients who visit the post on average daily.The local people are thankful to the rural municipality for managing the MBBS post and enhancing health services at the health post. The villagers expect to get minor surgery facilities as well. “We don’t need to go to the district hospital or outside the district for minor health problems now which comes as such a relief but it’d be better if the health post also provides surgery facilities for safe delivery,” said Mankala Rana, a resident of Airawati-6.Meanwhile, Gaumukhi Rural Municipality has also managed an MBBS doctor at Puja Health Post. “We managed the MBBS doctor at the health post even before Covid-19 pandemic,” said Bishnu Kumar Giri, the local unit chair. “Also, we are currently constructing a 15-bed hospital, committed to expanding quality health services in the rural areas.”","Published at : January 10, 2023",Pyuthan,Shamsher Bikram GC
Nepal’s biodiversity attracts foreign research students,"Peter Newbery, a retired medical doctor from Australia, is an avid birding enthusiast. Pursuing his passion, the 65-year-old retired doctor enrolled at Charles Sturt University in New South Wales, Australia to study Environmental Science.What piqued Newbery’s interest most is the Oriental pratincole, a swallow species that migrates to the Indian subcontinent from Australia in the summer to breed. Newbery, accompanied by 11 Bachelor of Environmental Science students and Associate Professor Melanie Massero from the university, is now in Nepal to study the habitat of the Oriental pratincole alongside other aquatic bird species.They landed in Nepal some three weeks ago to study birds, wildlife and biodiversity the country is home to. The team visited Jagadishpur lake in Kapilvastu to learn about the habitat of the migratory aquatic birds including Oriental pratincoles.“I observed some wetlands near the Nepal-India border including Jagadishpur lake in Kapilvastu,” said Newbery. “Many of my queries about birds—mainly the habitats, foods and breeding environment—have been addressed after I visited various places in Nepal.”Jagadishpur lake was declared a bird sanctuary, the country’s second, in July last year. The division forest office in Kapilvastu had started the due process to make Jagadishpur lake a bird sanctuary after some forest, environment and eco-tourism experts recommended that the lake is ideal to be remodelled as one.According to conservationists, of the 891 species of birds found in Nepal, 167 species, including Oriental pratincole, grebes, cormorants, herons, egrets, stork, ducks and geese, terns and gulls, are found in the Jagadishpur lake. The lake provides shelter to 15,000 to 20,000 migratory birds that arrive from as far away as Siberia, China, Russia, Mongolia, Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan to spend the winter. The Australian team came to Jagadishpur lake to study aquatic birds.Jagadishpur Lake was listed as a Ramsar wetland site in August 2003. The lake is spread over 157 hectares across Kapilvastu Municipality’s wards 9 and 10, and is located some 11 kilometres north of Taulihawa, the district headquarters.According to senior ornithologist Hemsagar Baral, Oriental pratincoles are also found in Jagadishpur lake in summer but they do not breed in the lake area. Baral said that Oriental pratincoles breed in the Manohara river in Bhaktapur.As part of their research, the Australian team is also focussing on the roles the locals living in close proximity to wildlife and birds play in conservation efforts.The team visited Annapurna Conservation Area, Ghandruk, Lumbini and the wetlands in its vicinity before they reached Jagadishpur lake last week. “We are really impressed to see that the Nepali culture, ways of life and the religions practised here have kept the conservation and protection of wildlife as a cornerstone of worship,” said Helen Thompson, one of the university students. “Nepalis worship crows, dogs, snakes, tortoises and other birds and animals which creates a mechanism to protect them from harm. I feel like Nepal is a safe haven for wildlife and birds to thrive in.”The university team is currently in Chitwan National Park and its buffer zone areas conducting their research.The university administration says that it chose Nepal as its research focal centre for its varied biodiversity and natural beauty. “Nepal is truly an amazing nation. One can observe snow-clad mountain peaks of the Himalayas, green hills and southern plains. The entire country can successfully turn into a sanctuary for birds and wildlife given its biodiversity,” said Massero, who leads the research team.Ashlee Barker, another student, added, “The natural beauty, biodiversity, birds and wildlife lured us to Nepal. Various works carried out in the conservation sector in the mountain, hill and Tarai regions in Nepal are laudable.”Conservationists and tourism entrepreneurs say that the selection of Nepal for their studies and research by the students and researchers of reputed universities is very helpful in promoting ecotourism in the country. “After their thorough study, the visiting students will publish a research book and share their experience,” Baral said. “That research paper will provide useful information for Nepal to make conservation plans for the future. It will also be an effective publicity for Nepal to develop eco-tourism.”","Published at : January 9, 2023",Kapilvastu,Manoj Paudel
"Six killed, 18 injured in Palpa bus accident","At least six people died and 18 were injured when a bus fell off a cliff in Madhuban, Rainadevi Chahara Rural Municipality-8, in Palpa district on Thursday night.Most of the passengers were from different settlements of the Khursane village of Raina Devi Chehra Rural Municipality-8.According to the Palpa District Police Office, the accident that occurred near Khursane village under the Saljhandi-Dhorpatan road section was blamed on the driver.“When the police personnel were recording statements from the injured, all of them complained that the driver had been drinking alcohol. The doctor’s report confirmed that the driver was drunk,” Birendra Thapa, information officer at District Police Office Palpa, told the Post.According to Lila Gaha, one of the injured, the driver had parked the vehicle at a local restaurant in Tarifat for around two hours. “People got upset and started quarrelling with the driver. After the dispute, the driver started the vehicle and in under 15 minutes the bus fell off the cliff,” said Gaha.The bus from Saljhandi of Rupandehi district was headed for Khursane of Palpa. Six people died on the spot. Three of them are from one family. The injured are being treated at Lumbini Regional Hospital and Edmond City Hospital.Thapa said the deceased included five women and one 11-year-old girl. Devka Rana, who lost three members of his family including the child, says the villages are aggrieved by the tragedy.“Everyone goes to Saljhandi market for personal work. Only one bus runs daily from Saljhandi to Khursane, leaving in the morning and returning at around 8 pm,” said Rana.“I spoke to a few survivors. They told me the driver got into an argument with the passengers after he got drunk and delayed the bus,” said Rana.Rem Bahadur Rana, ward chairman of Raina Devi Chehra Rural Municipality-8, said that since the Saljhandi-Dhorpatan road section is not accident-prone, the driver was at fault.According to Thapa, the bus fell 70 metres below the road.

"One dead, 30 sick in measles outbreak","Measles, a viral respiratory disease, has killed one and infected over 30 children in Nepalgunj in the past week, indicating that an outbreak is afoot.A 31-month-old toddler died of the disease in Nepalgunj Sub-Metropolitan City-5 in Banke, a Tarai district in Lumbini Province, on Wednesday.More than 30 children have fallen sick from the disease in various wards of the same local unit.Measles is an extremely contagious infection, which spreads through respiratory droplets.According to the District Public Health Office (DPHO), Banke, the disease is turning into an epidemic as the guardians of the sick children failed to seek immediate treatment.The DPHO said it has taken initiatives to contain the outbreak by deploying health workers to the affected area.Following the toddler’s death, the DPHO held an emergency meeting on Thursday to control the spread of the disease and wrote to the local government [Nepalgunj Sub-metropolis] for assistance. According to the health office, the outbreak has spread to the sub-metropolis's wards 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15 and 20 as of Thursday.“We have started providing treatment to the infected children in their own homes,” said Sunita Paudel, chief at the DPHO. “A child died of measles before he came into contact with the health workers. We are searching for patients in every ward to control the disease from spreading further.”Preparations are on to soon launch a vaccination drive against measles in the affected area, she added. According to her, 4,500 doses of measles vaccines have arrived in Banke.On Saturday, samples of five children from the same family in Nepalgunj-5 were sent to Kathmandu for tests. Four of the children, including the deceased one, were diagnosed with measles infection during the laboratory tests.Health workers and technicians from the World Health Organisation, UNICEF, the District Public Health Office and the health unit of Nepalgunj Sub-Metropolitan City have been mobilised in the area following the outbreak.A health worker from the basic health centre at ward 5 who was deployed to monitor and track down measles patients has also fallen sick.According to the DPHO, children between the ages of nine months and 15 years have contracted the disease. The health office said it is collecting data on the infected people. According to Ram Bahadur Chand, the chief of the health unit of Nepalgunj Sub-Metropolitan City, almost all the infected children had not received a measles vaccination. “Health workers will administer vaccines against measles to the children between nine months to 15 years from Friday,” said Chand.A 2022 report by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and UNICEF warned that there could be a significant increase in the number of measles cases around the world. The report cites low global vaccination rates in the past few years as the main driver of this increase.Seven years ago, two children died of measles at ward 5 of the sub-metropolis. But the sub-metropolis has not launched any programme against measles citing a lack of budget. “We don’t have the budget to tackle this health issue. We don’t have the resources to launch an awareness campaign,” said Tej Oli, a health officer at the sub-metropolis’s health unit.Early symptoms, which usually appear 10-12 days after infection, include high fever, runny nose, bloodshot eyes and white tiny spots inside the mouth. Several days later, a rash develops on the face, upper neck and other parts of the body. It is one of the most easily spread viruses among humans and is particularly dangerous for children.Nepal had committed to eliminating measles and rubella viruses by 2019 but due to its inability to meet the target, the Health Ministry has extended the deadline to 2023. To meet the target, coverage of both regular immunisation and special campaigns should be at 95 percent, which seems impossible in the existing context.The Nepal government launched a routine measles vaccination programme in the late 1980s. However, measles continues to stalk many children across the country.","Published at : January 5, 2023",Nepalgunj,J Pandey

Women in Madhesh are being murdered over dowry,"Puja Loniya, a 23-year-old woman from Jaipur of Nepalgunj sub-metropolitan city, was found dead at her husband’s house on December 13.Puja, a mother of a son and a daughter, was married to Rajkumar Loniya of Janaki Rural Municipality-6 five years ago. Puja’s parents received the news of her death through a neighbour and have accused Rajkumar’s family of torturing and killing their daughter over dowry. They claim that their daughter committed suicide because of dowry-related physical and mental abuse. They have filed a complaint against her husband and father-in-law at the local police station in Kohalpur. Puja’s post-mortem report states that she died by consuming poison, police said.Puja went back to her husband’s house from her parents’ house just 20 days before the incident and would regularly inform her parents about the regular torture she was subjected to from Rajkumar’s family for dowry. She went back to her husband's house on the condition that she wouldn’t be tortured any more, and Rajkumar also agreed not to abuse her. “Her husband is under police custody now,"" said Motiram Chauhan, uncle of Puja.A few months ago, Godi Varma of Janaki Rural Municipality in Banke was also found dead. Police have said she committed suicide by hanging. The victim's parents, however, accused her husband's family of murdering her and filed a complaint of murder against the family. Her parents accused the family of torturing her reguraly for dowry.Similarly, Afsarul Khan of Rapti Sonari Rural Municipality-7 was found dead hanging in her room on November 2. Khan was the mother of a nine-month-old boy. Her medical report also said that she committed suicide. However, the victim’s parents said that it was a murder. On November 4, the police filed a case saying Khan was abetted for suicide. After the complaint, Khan’s husband and brother-in-law have been remanded into judicial custody.""The police did not file our complaint the first time but only after the fourth time when we put pressure on them and demanded justice,” said Wahab Khan, the father of the deceased. “My daughter and Meraj Shesh got married two years ago, and after some time, she was repeatedly tortured mentally and physically for dowry. My daughter did not commit suicide; she was murdered by Meraj’s family, and they made it look like it was suicide. No matter what happens, I will fight the legal battle to get justice for my daughter."" ""Look at the nine-month-old,” he added. “How are we going to tell him what happened to her mother when he grows up?""The police have been investigating Khan’s case by putting Meraj Shesh, her husband, and her brother-in-law Alamin Shesh in custody. However, the relatives and parents of Khan have demanded that all the family members should be investigated by putting them in custody. Relatives of the victims are still struggling to get justice from the police administration. They also complain that the government does not ensure justice to victims.Basanta Gautam, a human rights activist in Banke, said that there are several pending cases of suicide and murder set up like a suicide. This problem occurs when the police do not do their investigation properly, Gautam said. When the police themselves become the judge and pass judgement on homicide cases, confusion occurs, resulting in victims like Khan not getting justice immediately, he added. Domestic violence complaints are increasing by the year as criminals go unpunished.According to the data of the District Police Office, Banke, there were 518 complaints of domestic violence in fiscal year 2019-20; 738 in 2020-21; and 844 in 202-22. It has been found that all the complaints were about cases of violence against women. Apart from the registered cases, most of the complaints get settled in the presence of the police. In the last three years, 1,278 cases were settled, while 222 complaints reached the court.""Even though women are being killed in the name of dowry and other things, the police do not file their complaint; they only do so after putting pressure on them,” said Ruby Khan, another human rights activist in Banke. “When the accused gets away unpunished, other perpetrators also feel emboldened. In cases related to murder, it is filed as abetment of suicide, which has made the victims more vulnerable.""","Published at : December 29, 2022",Nepalgunj,Rupa Gahatraj

Kidney patients face long wait for dialysis at government hospitals,"Mina Tharu’s husband has been suffering from kidney disease for over a year now. He returned from foreign employment a year ago and needs regular dialysis to survive. But the couple, who live in Badhaiyatal Rural Municipality-4, Bardiya, are having a hard time managing medical costs.Mina takes her husband to Bheri Hospital in Nepalgunj where the dialysis is done free of cost but the cost of medication required for her husband is breaking her back, says Mina.“Only free dialysis is not helping kidney patients from poor families like us. The medicine is so expensive and even though the government provides some free medicines, they are hard to come by at hospital pharmacies,” said Mina. “We have been selling our belongings one by one to cover the medicine cost.”Medication for kidney patients on dialysis costs above Rs3,000 per visit.“My husband has to go through dialysis twice a week in order to live. I don’t think we can continue the treatment for a long time because we are running out of money and people to take loans from. In a few months, we may not have anything to eat. The government hospitals provide free dialysis service but we have to pay for the bed and medication,” said Mina. “Also, we have to wait for our turn for free dialysis service. Sometimes we are made to wait for months.”Rampyari Tharu of Rajapur Municipality whose husband also suffers from kidney disease and has been dependent on dialysis for several years is also facing financial problems.Rampyari’s husband also goes to the Bheri Hospital for dialysis. But the couple has been waiting for his turn for dialysis since September 7. “I take my husband to private hospitals from time to time for dialysis since it is difficult to get dates at the hospital,” she said.“We come from a working-class family and don’t have much. All our savings went into my husband’s treatment. Now we have been selling our valuables to continue his treatment,” said Rampyari. “We don’t even get the free medicines. There is always a shortage of free medicines in the hospital’s pharmacy. Every time we have to spend from Rs7,000 to Rs10,000 at private hospitals. One has to wait for months in order to get free dialysis service from the government hospital and my husband needs dialysis twice a week.”Like Rampiyari and Mina, families of kidney patients see no recourse but to take the patient to private hospitals and clinics for dialysis where they have to spend more than they would at government hospitals.Currently, 86 people are waiting for dialysis at Bheri Hospital. On average 27 people receive dialysis service from the hospital daily. Although there are 10 machines, only four machines are currently in use. It takes four hours for one person to complete dialysis, which is conducted in three stages in 24 hours. According to Ram Kothari Tharu, a paramedic employee of Bheri Hospital, the other six machines are not in operation due to technical reasons. The machines have been taken to Kathmandu for maintenance.Narayani Devi Shrestha, a 76-year-old woman from Khajura Rural Municipality-3, got her free dialysis after waiting for three months at Bheri Hospital.“Poor people have to suffer in silence. Those who have the money to go to private hospitals have a choice but poor people like us cannot even do that. The government should increase the capacity of the dialysis service according to the flow of the patients,” said Subadhra Shrestha, Narayani Devi’s son.Dr Parash Shrestha of Bheri Hospital said that patients suffering from kidney disease have to receive regular blood transfusions, and the possibility of hepatitis C infection during blood transfusions is very high. There is no dialysis service available for hepatitis C infected patients anywhere other than Kathmandu and Teaching Hospital in Kohalpur, Shrestha said, adding that several kidney disease patients have also died because of not receiving regular dialysis.Ram Kothari, the paramedic, said that there is no data on how many on the waitlist are still alive. “The situation is getting harder every day,” she said.Dialysis service in Nepalgunj Medical College Teaching Hospital, Kohalpur resumed after a gap of one week on December 10. The hospital had a contract with Birang Health Care, a private company, for conducting dialysis services for patients of the hospital for the past three years. The health care centre stopped the dialysis service when the hospital failed to pay its dues.Recently, the government decided to allow only public hospitals and medical colleges that have a contract with the government to run dialysis services. However, according to the hospital administration at the medical college, the government has not provided funds for dialysis to them since mid-June 2021.Dr Resham Bahadur Rana, director of the medical college, said that they had to stop the services temporarily when the contract with the private clinic was terminated. “Kidney patients suffered a lot and some patients even died,” Rana said. “Some patients were forced to go to India.”","Published at : December 16, 2022",Nepalgunj,Rupa Gahatraj

Faecal coliform confirmed in water used in Palpa wedding feast,"The cause of illness in more than 150 wedding attendees in Palpa was polluted water, according to the Palpa Health Office.The water used in the wedding feast at Chirtungdhara in Bagnaskali Rural Municipality-1, Palpa on Saturday was found to be contaminated, the health office said. Laboratory test results have confirmed the presence of faecal coliform bacteria in the water.Two drums of water were used during the wedding feast and faecal coliform bacteria was found in one of the drums, said Madhusudhan Bhattarai, lab technician at the health office.According to Bhattarai, the health office is yet to determine whether the contamination was limited to that one drum of water or if the water source itself is contaminated.Drinking water contaminated with faecal coliform could lead to water-borne diseases, including diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid, and hepatitis, among others.Dan Bahadur Gaha, a resident of Chirtungdhara, organised a party on the occasion of his daughter’s wedding for more than 150 villagers and relatives. Almost all the attendees started falling ill a day later.According to health workers deployed in the area, family members of over 100 families from Budhakhande, Bhanjeli, Amreli, Pipartung, and Dhatol localities in Churtungdhara and Ghorbanda villages were taken ill.The patients complained of having multiple symptoms including fever, diarrhoea, headache, nausea and vomiting.According to locals, some people pointed out that the water was murky but nobody paid attention to it.According to Saraswati Chidi, chair of Bagnaskali Rural Municipality, health workers were deployed in every house following the mass illness. According to Saroj Kafle, head of Pokharathok Health Post, reports of people falling ill in neighbouring villages are also coming in.“Most of the people who came to attend the wedding were sick,” Kafle said. “As waterborne diseases can infect others easily, everyone should follow safety standards and drink clean water.”","Published at : December 9, 2022",Palpa,Madhav Aryal
Lumbini chief minister’s office moved to Deukhuri overnight,"On Monday, Lumbini Province’s Office of Chief Minister and Council of Ministers was moved to Deukhuri in Dang from Butwal overnight.Tilakram Sharma, spokesperson for the Lumbini province government, said the office’s equipment were transported to the provincial capital on three trucks on Monday night. “Now the chief minister’s office will operate from Dang once the office is set up,” Sharma told the Post.Despite a call by political parties and civil servants to postpone the plan until the physical infrastructures are ready, Chief Minister Kul Prasad KC moved ahead with it anyway. The coalition partner Nepali Congress, main opposition party CPN-UML, government employees and newly elected provincial assembly members had protested against the move.The provincial assembly on October 6, 2020 decided to shift the provincial capital from Butwal in Rupandehi district to Deukhuri valley in Dang. The then chief minister Shankar Pokharel had announced that the provincial headquarters would be shifted only after construction of necessary infrastructures was complete. But two years after the decision, the construction remains incomplete.The provincial government plans to house its ministries on the premises of the Rapti Technical School in Deukhuri. A week ago, Chief Minister KC, a CPN (Maoist Centre) leader, instructed government employees and other stakeholders to shift his office. His instructions included making necessary arrangements to house the offices in Rapti Technical School within five days.The provincial government transported the goods with the help of the security personnel and the Maoist activists despite the noncooperation from the employees.Chief Minister KC has been performing his office work by setting up an office in a room of Rapti Rural Municipality in Dang since December 1. He visited Butwal whenever required. After knowing the possible noncooperation and even the protest of the employees, KC shifted the office goods during the night on his own initiative.The civil servants and some of the secretariat members came to know about the relocation only on Tuesday morning. According to an official at the chief minister’s office who refused to be named, there was no discussion or preparation done at the office to move it to the permanent capital. KC’s move to hastily shift the provincial capital to Deukhuri has drawn mixed reactions.The people’s representatives from Rupandehi and its surrounding districts, business communities, political parties and the locals are against the move while those in Dang and some other districts in the province have welcomed the move.Bhumishwar Dhakal, the former chief whip of the UML in the Lumbini provincial assembly, said that KC’s move was wrong. It could cause confrontation among the political parties and stakeholders, he said. “There are no problems to implement the decision made by the two-thirds majority of the provincial assembly but the capital was shifted without constructing the necessary infrastructures,” Dhakal said. “All the ministries cannot be operated from the building which was constructed for a technical school.”Government employees and various organisations they are affiliated to protested against the government’s decision, citing a lack of infrastructure to operate government offices there. On Wednesday, they submitted a joint memorandum to Deepak Kafle, the chief secretary of the Lumbini Province, urging the provincial government to postpone its decision until the physical infrastructures are readied in Deukhuri.A few months after Deukhuri was declared the provincial capital, the provincial government had shifted the Ministry of Tourism, Rural and Urban Development to the town. Minister Dilli Bahadur Chaudhary also moved to Deukhuri, but the minister soon returned to Butwal saying he could not work effectively due to the lack of infrastructure in the new location.

The provincial offices should be shifted to the new capital as per the mandate of the provincial assembly,” said Tilakram Sharma, provincial minister for Internal Affairs and Communications. “However, we need to first have proper infrastructure in place. The ministers will be shifted only after arranging a building and other necessary infrastructures in Deukhuri,” said Sharma, who is also the spokesperson of the Lumbini Provincial government. A source at the Office of the Chief Minister and the Council of Ministers said all provincial ministries would be accommodated on the premises of the Rapti Technical School, while the Office of the Chief Minister and the Council of Ministers would be set up in the building of the Rapti Rural Municipality. “Preparations are underway to shift the Office of the Chief Minister and Council of Ministers, and the Ministry of Finance and Cooperatives to Deukhuri in the first phase,” said the source.It is learnt that outgoing chief minister Kul Prasad KC; finance and cooperatives minister Krishna Dhwaj Khadka and outgoing speaker Purna Bahadur Gharti have pressured for moving the offices and ministries at the earliest. Chief Minister KC, a CPN (Maoist Centre) leader, has been criticised within his party allegedly for committing corruption while awarding a contract for the construction of a building for the provincial hospital. A party insider even claimed that KC was denied a ticket in the November 20 elections as a punishment for committing financial irregularities.Khadka’s wife Rekha Sharma, however, contested for parliament seat from Dang-2 and won. Also during her election campaign, she and her party leaders promised to voters to shift the ministries to Deukhuri. “The leaders are hastily moving the offices to Deukhuri for political gains,” said a government officer at the Office of Chief Minister and the Council of Ministers, requesting anonymity.","Published at : December 3, 2022",Rupandehi,Ghanshyam Gautam

Government inaction makes life miserable in two flood-prone Banke villages,"On October 7, Anita Kewat saw no escape and climbed onto the roof of her hut clutching her infant daughter. The floodwaters from the Rapti river had started entering her village Chaupheri in Duduwa Rural Municipality-2. The water was already waist-high and would soon sweep away her hut.“Soon after, the water reached the roof. I jumped into the water and swam to my neighbour’s roof with my daughter in tow. The next four days were miserable for us. We stayed put on our neighbour’s roof, hungry and scared,” said Kewat. “I saw my whole settlement getting swallowed that night.”The floodwaters from the river had completely submerged Chaupheri and its neighbouring villages in October. The villagers spent a week trying to find safe spaces, says Kewat. “Our houses were submerged in water. We had lost our livestock and every single grain in the house.”According to Nakke Chai, a local of Ramnagar, another village affected by the October floods, all the villagers climbed onto trees, roofs, or other high places in order to save their lives. “There was no food or clean drinking water for a week. It’s a wonder we all survived,” said Chai.According to the municipal office, around 500 households in the settlements of Chaupheri and Ramnagar, in ward 2 of Duduwa Rural Municipality were affected by the October floods. These two villages have been facing inundation and floods every year during the monsoon season for more than two decades now. “We have been living with the same problems since 1998-99. Inundation affects every aspect of our lives—from losing fertile fields to our livestock,” said Chai.The two villages suffer power cuts and a shortage of drinking water every monsoon. But even during the dry season, they don’t live comfortably, say locals. “Our children remain out of school as there is none nearby and we succumb to minor ailments and injuries without access to a hospital,” said Chai. “In the last 25 years, Chaupheri and Ramnagar have been inundated more than 55 times. Several people have also lost their loved ones,” said Aagyaram Godiya, a 55-year-old man from Ramnagar. “In the monsoon of 2014, I saved myself by climbing a tree. I stayed on that tree—hungry—for three days. But it wasn’t easy even after the water drained out because all our winter harvest was washed away.” Residents say the local authorities are aware of the difficulties faced by the two villages but they are yet to extend help. Sundarlal Loniya of Ramnagar says flooding is becoming worse every year with erratic monsoon. “Earlier we tackled flooding only during the monsoon season but in the last few years, even pre- and post-monsoon seasons have become dangerous for those living here,” said Loniya.An embankment built by India near Holiya town in Banke district controls the flow of Rapti River and most residents blame this embankment for the worsening flood situation in the area.According to the report of the World Commission on Dams, the Lakshmanpur dam was built in violation of international law. However, as the political parties and leadership are not committed to solving the problem, local people have had to suffer, says Loniya. Like Duduwa Rural Municipality, several other places and towns get inundated by floods in the Rapti river every year. Bethani, Holiya, Matehiya, Fatehpur, and Gangapur have been facing inundation every year for the past 29 years. India’s Department of Water Resources and River Development and Nepal’s Department of Water Resources and Irrigation signed an agreement for the construction of an embankment along the Rapti river last June. A concrete embankment 35 km long and a mud embankment 6 km long were to be built on both sides of the Rapti but work is yet to begin. According to Chief District Officer Surya Bahadur Karki, the agreement states that India would cover Rs10.44 billion of the total cost, including technical monitoring, and Nepal would bear Rs1 billion. “However, after four months of the deal, construction of the embankment is delayed in the absence of a final survey of the inundation situation,” said Khatri. “The dams in the Rapti river have become a geopolitical issue. It must be sorted at the highest level between the two countries. Until such a time, the sufferings of the locals will continue.”“There is no way for us to prevent such a disaster on our own. The higher authorities and related bodies have not paid enough attention to this issue,” said Narendra Chaudhary, chairman of Duduwa Rural Municipality.“Even the District Disaster Management Committee's assistance is not enough to prevent flooding in the area. The municipal office does everything within its power to mitigate the disasters every year but unless the higher authorities intervene, there is not much we can do.”","Published at : November 25, 2022",Banke,J Pandey

Authorities’ apathy affects conservation of fishing cats,"A fishing cat, locally known as Pani Biralo, was found critically injured on a road in Dayanagar village in Krishnanagar Municipality-8, Kapilvastu on October 28. The locals who had found the injured cat informed the division forest office in Chandrauta but the cat succumbed to its injuries before a rescue team could reach the site.Fishing cats have been enlisted as endangered mammal species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. It is estimated that there are around 150 to 200 fishing cats in Nepal. The medium-sized cat species are found in South and Southeast Asia. Conservationists have raised concerns about the increasing deaths of fishing cats in road accidents in Nepal.The adult fishing cat found in Dayanagar village last week had sustained injuries in its mouth, according to Rajat Pratap Sah, the mayor of Krishnanagar. “The injuries did not seem life-threatening and the cat could have been saved if it was discovered sooner,” he said. According to the forest officials, search is on for the hit-and-run culprit. Rama Mishra, a conservationist who is pursuing a doctoral degree in fishing cats, says another fishing cat had died in a similar road accident in Tribeni of Nawalparasi (West) last year. “The number of fishing cats is very low in Nepal and the world. Losing these cats to road accidents harms conservation efforts,” said Mishra who has been working towards the conservation of fishing cats for the past 10 years.Conservationists say indifference on the part of government authorities and their limited understanding of the need for the conservation of this endangered species is one of the reasons behind the failure to increase the population of these cats with road accidents, shrinking wetland areas and poaching being the other reasons.“These cats are elusive so when we spot one on camera traps set up in forests for monitoring, we feel exuberant. Although the government and several other organisations have been working for the conservation of wildlife, fishing cats are yet to make it to their priority list,” said Swechchha Shrestha, another conservationist studying the fishing cats. “There is a shortage of means and resources in its conservation.” Conservationists underscore the need for an immediate and effective rescue of the injured animals and stringent legal action against the guilty involved in injuring and killing the endangered and protected animals in the country. Hem Sagar Baral, a senior ornithologist, says that the incidents of injuries and death of these rare animals will continue to go unchecked unless effective implementation of conservation laws is ensured.According to the prevailing legal provisions, one will be fined Rs100,000 to Rs500,000 or jailed for one year to five years or both if one is found guilty of killing fishing cats.The fishing cat (Prionailurus viverrinus) is a feline with a powerful build and about twice the size of a house cat. The size of an adult ranges from 57-78 cm and weighs between 15-16 kg. The fishing cat is an adept swimmer and preys on fish frequently. Wetlands are the major habitats of fishing cats. In Nepal, these cats are mainly found in Chitwan, Bardiya, Nawalparasi, Kapilvastu, Bara, Parsa and near the river banks of the Karnali, Babai, Rapti, Narayani, and Koshi rivers.","Published at : November 6, 2022",Kapilvastu,Manoj Poudel
Victims of last month’s Pyuthan landslides languish in school buildings,"Uma Budhathoki Magar, a nursing mother in her mid-thirties, has been staying at a local school building in Airawati Rural Municipality-4 for the past month. After a landslide damaged her house on October 5, she had no alternative but to take shelter at the community school building. The landslide left the whole Tigrapatal village, Magar’s native, at high risk.While the local unit has managed food for Airawati’s displaced people, the condition of the makeshift habitat in the school is poor, more so for a new mother like Magar.“I have a small baby in my lap, and the temperature is gradually decreasing,” Magar said. “We don’t know when we will return home. Nobody has visited us to inquire about our plight except the rural municipal authority.”Landslides triggered by heavy rains in Tigrapatal last month displaced as many as 23 families, most of whom have been taking shelter at the school. Various social organisations and individuals have provided relief materials to the displaced through the local unit.With federal and provincial elections around the corner, political leaders, candidates and cadres have intensified their activities across the district. But they have totally ignored the plight of the displaced, residents say.“The candidates walk along the way distributing their publicity materials and election messages but they haven’t entered the school where we are taking shelter which is just below the main road,” Magar said.Another displaced victim, Sanu Budha Magar, said, “The party leaders used to visit our doorsteps in the previous elections canvassing votes. They assured us to construct roads, drinking water projects, electricity and airports. But they do not even visit us when we are in difficulties.”Moreover, the residents have a more immediate threat to worry about.A hill just above Tigrapatal village has developed huge cracks, leaving the whole settlement at high risk, residents say, adding that political parties and their leaders have remained tight-lipped about the situation of the flood and landslide victims.Like elsewhere in the country, last month’s heavy rains caused widespread damage in Pyuthan, a hill district in Lumbini Province. Alongside Tigrapatal’s 23 families, the landslides displaced 50 families of Markawang and Dhanchaur villages of Mandabi Rural Municipality. Many of them set up makeshift habitats in community buildings and schools.And with many schools resuming their classes on Monday after the festive vacations, the displaced inhabitants are now worried about finding another shelter.The authorities concerned, however, haven’t taken any initiatives for their rehabilitation, residents say.When Chief Minister of Lumbini Province Kul Prasad KC and other high level officials visited the landslide-affected villages of Tigrapatal, Markawang and Dhanchaur after the natural disasters, the residents were hopeful that they’d be resettled soon. The visiting group had promised that a technical team would study the risk of landslides in the villages and help the displaced resettle.But any move towards that is yet to be taken, with victims left frustrated.“I am fed up with the leaders’ assurances,” said Shivalal Pun Magar, a landslide victim from Mandabi-2. “I don’t like to hear the name of the parties and their leaders anymore.”","Published at : November 3, 2022",Pyuthan,Shamsher Bikram GC
"At least 5 dead, 30 injured in bus accident in Nawalparasi East","At least five people died and 30 others were injured, some critically, in a bus accident at Mathar of Bulingtar Rural Municipality in Nawalparasi (East) on Sunday.According to the Area Police Office in Dedhgaun, the bus was carrying devotees who were heading to Manakamana Temple in Gorkha district from Rambha Rural Municipality-1 in Palpa district. The vehicle swerved off the dirt road and plunged some 100 metres.The villagers of Hungi settlement of Rambha-1 had reserved two buses and set off for Manakamana at around 9pm through Kaligandaki corridor on Saturday. One of the vehicles met with an accident when it reached Bulingtar.Police identified the deceased as Tara BK, 41, Binaya BK, 17, Dhanisara BK, 62, Debi Gaha, 58, of Rambha-1 and Phulmaya Majhi, 45, of Galyang Municipality-9 in Syangja district. The bodies were taken to Rampur Hospital in Palpa for the postmortem. According to the police, there were 35 people on board when the accident occurred.Though the incident happened at around 3am, the security personnel knew about the tragedy very late. A pedestrian informed the police of the accident around two hours after it happened.The delay in rescue cost many lives.“We knew of the accident only in the morning. The bus fell into a ravine and got stuck on the cliff. We could not rescue the victims due to geographical difficulty,” said Tanka Rana, a resident of Bulingtar. He said some critically injured people died as they could not be rescued timely.The bus driver and his assistant also sustained injuries in the accident. The injured were rushed to Old Medical College in Chitwan for treatment.Deputy Superintendent of Police Santosh Pathak said he suspects the incident happened as the driver dozed off while driving the vehicle.","Published at : October 30, 2022",Nawalparasi/palpa,Madhav Aryal						 &
Manpower shortage affects health services in Lumbini,"Four years ago, the federal government introduced an ambitious plan to build one 15-bed hospital in every local unit across the country.Out of the 109 local units in Lumbini Province, 89 have not built hospitals yet. Only Mandabi Rural Municipality in Pyuthan started constructing a hospital building while 88 others have not even started the work. In some cases, there is a dispute between the people's representatives over where to build the hospital. As a result, the people in rural areas of the hill districts of the province, where hospitals are few and far between, have to go far even for the treatment of minor diseases and injuries.“I have heard several speeches that a hospital would be built in every local unit, but I don’t see anything happening about it,” said Sita Sunar of Bagdula in Pyuthan Municipality-9. “There is no hospital nearby, and people are deprived of health facilities in the rural areas. People have to travel 9 km to reach the district hospital in Pyuthan.”Recently, modern techniques of health treatment have been introduced to private health institutions in major towns and cities of the province. But the problem of the rural folks remains the same. They are forced to suffer as the government’s plan to operate a hospital in each local body is left in limbo.According to Bhoj Prasad Shrestha, former health minister of the Lumbini Province, the health sector did not grow mainly due to the lack of coordination among the three governments and their reluctance to give continuity to the plans initiated by the previous government.In Lumbini, there are 13 hospitals and 13 Ayurveda treatment facilities. For them, the provincial government has been allocating about Rs4 billion every year. Out of the 1,249 posts sanctioned for these health institutions, 676 remain vacant. Given the data, a specialist doctor looks after 104,709 patients, a nurse has 3,539 in her share and there is a medical officer for 54,625 people on average.Binodraj Giri, chief at the province health directorate, said posts in various public health institutions remained vacant as the provincial public service commission was yet to be established to select personnel.“The country moved to federalism, the number of health institutions increased and the doctors were divided between the federal and provincial governments,” Giri said. “But despite the rise in the number of health institutions and health services, the number of doctors and health workers remains the same. The shortage of human resources causes problems in delivering quality health services.”According to Giri, there are 1,530 beds in Lumbini including the federal and provincial hospitals. Due to lack of skilled manpower, some hospitals are unable to operate equipment for ICU and HDU services.Bheri Hospital, Rapti Academy of Health Science and Khajura Cancer Hospital are under the federal government. The federal government allocates around Rs1 billion to them annually. But the people are forced to visit private health institutions as they do not get good services at public hospitals, which reel under shortages of human resources and equipment.“Due to the lack of manpower, hospitals have to rely on helpers and junior health workers,” said Munshi Prasad Majhi, the health unit chief in Sammarimai Rural Municipality, Rupandehi. “Even though the scope of healthcare has widened in the hospital, we have not been able to provide the services due to lack of manpower.”Lately, the problem of non-communicable diseases is increasing in the province. The Lumbini provincial government has been providing Rs200,000 per person for heart valve replacement, kidney transplant and cancer treatment and Rs50,000 per person per year for asthma and bronchitis patients.From the financial year 2020-21, hundreds of patients have received financial support from the government, including 1,473 patients with asthma and bronchitis and 278 people with cancer, heart and kidney diseases.Provincial Health Minister Indrajit Tharu said that the provincial government prioritised improving physical infrastructures and upgrading the hospitals. “But we have not achieved our goal as expected due to the shortage of required human resources,” he added.According to the data of the provincial health directorate, out of the 12 districts of the province, except Rukum (East), 11 districts have operated maternity services with surgery. There are 91 percent of institutional deliveries and 87 percent of deliveries by skilled manpower. However, the infant mortality rate in Lumbini is higher than the number of the whole country. Neonatal mortality rate is 30 per thousand live births, infant mortality rate is 42 per thousand and 45 people under five years of age die per thousand.","Published at : October 25, 2022",Butwal,Amrita Anmol
Pyuthan faces water crisis as disasters damage project sites,"Sita Thapa of Punyakhola in Pyuthan Municipality-7 has had to deal with a water crisis for a week now. The water tap in her house has dried up. She and her villagers have no alternative but to drink murky water from the local stream. Heavy monsoon rains since October 4 triggered landslides that have damaged the local drinking water project and water springs in the area. “I am doubtful about finding out the water spring we used earlier,” Thapa said.The soils and stones that were dumped haphazardly while constructing Mallarani-Chuja-Salhalna road a few years ago were swept away by the recent rains and incurred damage at a water lifting project, a major project to supply water in Khalanga, the district headquarters.Basant Lal Shakya, the chairman of the water lifting project, said the landslides have damaged three tanks of the project and water supply will resume only after removing the debris and repairing the damaged tanks and pipelines.Landslides also damaged three other projects that supply water to Khalanga, according to Shakya. Water supply from the Bhulke, Kotapdhera and Torpekhark projects has completely stopped. “It seems that it will take more than a month to repair those damaged drinking water projects,” Shakya said.According to him, water from a local stream has been supplied to the district headquarters through the water lifting project. “The consumers in the headquarters have been urged to use the water for purposes other than drinking,” Shakya added.There are seven projects to supply drinking water to the district headquarters. Only two of them are in operation now. The floods and landslides damaged five other drinking water projects.The drinking water situation is also the same in other villages. Almost all the drinking water projects in Mallarani Rural Municipality have been damaged, said Kumar Shrestha, ward chairman of Mallarani-4. The floods and landslides buried the springs of some projects while the pipelines have been washed away in other projects.Phaltarukh settlement in Pyuthan Municipality-7 is also under the drinking water crisis after a landslide buried the intake of a local drinking water project. “The villagers are forced to use murky water from a local rivulet after boiling,” said Amar Bahadur Gharti of Phaltarukh. There are 30 households in the settlement. Netra Bahadur KC, ward chairman of Pyuthan Municipality-7, said that landslides have damaged the springs of a dozen drinking water projects in the ward alone. The water sources in the Darekhola and Phaltarukh streams have been damaged by the landslide, KC said, adding the reserve tanks of some projects were swept away. In Dhadamgra, more than 100 metres of pipes have been washed away by the landslide. “We have requested the municipal office for new pipes to repair,” KC said.According to Devendra Burma, deputy mayor of Pyuthan Municipality, landslides damaged more than 100 water sources in 10 wards of the municipality.“We have urged the concerned authorities for the immediate repair of the damaged water projects,” Burma said. “I have requested the chief district officer to take the initiative for the pipes from the Water Supply Division Office.”According to the District Administration Office in Pyuthan, the recent floods and landslides damaged more than 400 water projects across the district. “Efforts are underway to repair the damaged water projects and resume water supply in coordination with the water supply division office and the local units,” said Chief District Officer Sunita Nepal. “We have instructed the division office to make available the required water pipes.”","Published at : October 16, 2022",Pyuthan,Shamsher Bikram GC
"In rural Pyuthan, an uphill struggle to reach school","Rabin Roka, 16, walks around three hours to reach his school and as much time to return home. A six-hour walk daily has taken a toll on his studies, he says.“We are worn out completely by the time we reach school,” said Roka, a ninth grader from Chhepane in Pyuthan Municipality-1 who studies at Mahendra Secondary School in Khalanga. “I can neither study well at school nor be able to do homework at home.”The students who walk such a long way often carry torchlights to return home during the short days in winter. “I want to do homework and study at home,” Roka added. “My academic performance is not satisfactory as I cannot study because I am tired.”There are nearly 100 students like Roka who are compelled to walk for hours to and from school, according to Pitambar Paudel, the headmaster at Mahendra Secondary School.The reason behind this is that there is no secondary school nearby Chhepane and Bukeni of Pyuthan Municipality; Sarangkot, Ramche, Rithekharka, Rampani, Jorchaur and Girichaur of neighbouring Mallarani Rural Municipality; and Sinduredanda of Eirawati Rural Municipality. A group of schoolchildren takes rest under a tree at Pyuthan Municipality in Pyuthan in this recent photo.  Post PhotoMost of the students at Mahendra Secondary School are from rural areas and they cannot stay at Khalanga, the district headquarters, due to financial constraints.The school is also unable to provide any facilities to the children from the far-flung settlements, Paudel said. “We don’t have the required physical infrastructure to run a hostel,” he said. “Provision of school buses will resolve the problem but the school does not have resources for it.”Paudel added that even the students who are doing well in their studies are facing problems because they have to walk such a long distance. “Students cannot concentrate on their studies due to fatigue and tiredness,” Paudel said. “The students are facing problems due to the lack of a good road system in the scattered small settlements.”Milan Sunar, a student from Sarangkot in Mallarani Rural Municipality-5 who is studying in class 10, said that he starts walking from 7am to reach his school at 10am.“When I reach school, I fall asleep because of fatigue,” Sunar said. “I feel tired the whole day and cannot function well.”The challenges get much harder during the rainy season. The students have to risk their lives to wade across the flooded streams in monsoon since there is no bridge over the Jhakristhan stream. Many students cannot even go to school due to floods in the rainy season.The school administration complains that this is affecting the institution’s overall academic achievement. “The school dropout is also very high,” said Paudel, the headmaster.","Published at : September 29, 2022",Pyuthan,Shamsher Bikram GC
Dr Govinda KC refuses to fly to Kathmandu for treatment,"A Nepal Army helicopter that touched down at Dhangadhi Airport on Tuesday afternoon to airlift Dr Gobinda KC to Kathmandu for medical attention returned after the public health activist refused to move until his demands are addressed.KC has been on a fast-unto-death for the past nine days. The health crusader seeking reforms in the medical education sector refused to fly to Kathmandu, Dr Amrit Jaisi, who is supporting the doctor in the campaign, said.“The army helicopter has arrived in Dhangadhi, but Dr KC has said that under no circumstances will he go to Kathmandu today,” Jaisi said. “If he is forcefully taken, he will consider it a ‘kidnapping’.”KC’s health condition in the past few days has been deteriorating, according to Yagyaraj Joshi, assistant chief district officer and spokesperson at District Administration Office, Kailali. The government on Tuesday deployed a helicopter to bring KC to Kathmandu for further treatment on the recommendation of Seti Provincial Hospital.The hospital said that KC’s health may deteriorate further because of an imbalance of nutrients and water in his body. He may also be suffering from a stomach ulcer, the hospital administration said in a statement on Tuesday morning.KC was admitted to the ICU of the provincial hospital on the second day of his hunger strike.In its statement, the hospital asked the Sudurpaschim’s Ministry of Social Development, the National Human Rights Commission and the federal Ministry of Health and Population to admit KC to a hospital with advanced healthcare facilities citing the doctor’s worsening health condition. The provincial hospital said KC has been suffering from severe stomach ulcer, fluctuation of heartbeat, breathing difficulties, decreasing level of oxygen in body, and low blood pressure, among other health complications.Chief District Officer of Kailali Kiran Thapa said the helicopter returned after KC refused to go to Kathmandu. “Efforts are on to send him to Kathmandu as the doctors informed his treatment was not possible in the province,” Thapa said. “But we could not send him forcefully due to his refusal. The next move depends on the centre’s decision.”Meanwhile, Pritam Subedi, one of KC’s assistants, informed that KC’s team and the government are holding talks in Kathmandu on Tuesday. After inconclusive negotiations on Sunday, talks between the two parties resumed on Tuesday at the Office of the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers.KC has been championing health reform causes since his first protest in July 2012. He has currently put forth a seven-point demand which includes but is not limited to the formulation of an umbrella act regarding health science institutions; the introduction of legal provisions for the appointment of office bearers of universities and health institutions; and to turn medical teaching institutions into non-profit institutions by 2029.","Published at : September 20, 2022",Dhangadhi,Arjun Shah
Aviation fuel depot at Tarigaun Airport padlocked,"Representatives from Tulsipur Sub-Metropolitan City and Tulsipur-chapter of Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce & Industry on Sunday padlocked the aviation fuel depot at the Tarigaun Airport.Tulsipur Sub-Metropolitan City deputy mayor Syani Chaudhary and Tulsipur-chapter of Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce & Industry Chairman Ram Prasad Chalise jointly padlocked the depot gate after the government tried to take away a fuel bowser from the airport. The 11,000 litres capacity bowser, that was brought to the airport on May 26, remains unused.Chaudhary said that the depot was padlocked as the bowser was being taken in an effort to shut down the airport which has been conducting regular operations after years of effort.Chalise said that his office has also submitted a memorandum to the Nepal Oil Corporation office in Tulsipur urging them not to take away the fuel bowser. “We have, through the memorandum, asked the Nepal Oil Corporation not to remove the fuel bowser,” said Chalise. “We will launch stern protests if our demand is not met.”Chalise informed that letters have been sent to Nepal Oil Corporation Central Office in Kathmandu, Regional Office, Nepalgunj, District Administration Office, District Police Office, Dang, Tulsipur Sub-Metropolitan City and Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce & Industry, through the Tulsipur depot. Nepal Airlines is the only airline operator currently running flights from the Tarigaun Airport. Other airlines have not been able to operate from the airport due to the lack of a fuel depot. Meanwhile, Bipin Shrestha, chief at the Tulsipur office of Nepal Oil Corporation, said that the oil monopoly’s central office had assured to send another fuel bowser after removing the existing one from the airport. “We have notified the central office after the locals demanded that the fuel bowser remains at the depot,” said Shrestha.","Published at : July 31, 2022",Dang,Durgalal KC
"With patient numbers soaring, Bheri Hospital faces shortage of beds","Bir Bahadur Chaudhary, a 35-year-old man of the Mukta Kamaiya [freed bonded labourers] settlement in Badhaiyatal Rural Municipality, Bardiya, had been suffering from fever for a couple of days. He went to the Bheri Zonal Hospital, Nepalgunj, for treatment on July 28. But was asked to come back the next day because there were not enough beds. “Even on the second day, I had to wait for several hours for a bed. But at least I got the bed to myself, unlike other patients who had to share their beds,” he said. “The hospital is filled to the brim with patients and there are no beds available for new patients.”Chaudhary was diagnosed with typhoid.With the onset of the rainy season, patients with typhoid, common cold, diarrhoea, fever, and cough, among others, have increased at the Bheri Zonal Hospital, Nepalgunj resulting in a shortage of beds at the hospital. The increase in the inflow of patients coming for treatment has overwhelmed the hospital administration, says Dr Badri Chapagain, the hospital superintendent. “We have been treating at least 40 patients at the 16-bed emergency unit daily by adding extra beds,” he said. “Even the OPD ward is overwhelmed with one doctor having to treat more than a dozen patients daily.” Of late, more than 500 patients have been visiting the hospital for OPD services daily, according to the hospital.“The hospital staff is under tremendous pressure because of insufficient beds at the hospital,” said Chapagain. “We are managing so far but if the patient numbers continue to rise, it may not be possible to provide treatment to all of them. The number of patients at the emergency department has also increased and we are providing treatment by adding more beds there too.”Patients from other districts of the Lumbini Province, Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces also come for treatment at the 150-bed capacity hospital, which is staffed by 60 doctors and 150 health workers. According to the information officer, Dr Sanket Kumar Rijal, the hospital is providing services by adding extra beds but if the flow of patients continues to swell, the hospital will not be able to take them in. Those coming to the hospital for treatment from other districts have been facing twice the difficulties because of the extra expense they have to incur for renting a place to stay near the hospital. “I somehow managed to see a doctor but I have to stay another night in Nepalgunj because I couldn’t show my test reports to the doctor,” said Ramesh Khatri from Masine village in Bheriganga Municipality, Karnali.“People with low income have no other place to go to for treatment than a government hospital,” said Chaudhary from Bardiya. “For now, the hospital has added more beds but they will soon run out of beds again.”","Published at : July 30, 2022",Nepalgunj,Thakur Singh Tharu
Tilaurakot gets a facelift amid efforts to put it on UNESCO World Heritage Sites list,"Tilaurakot, an ancient Shakya capital city where Siddhartha Gautam spent his princely life before he became the Buddha, has got a facelift.The historic place was left unattended and neglected until a few years back. In a bid to beautify the revered pilgrimage site, the authorities have focussed on building support infrastructures inside the ancient site.A two-kilometre wooden walkway that winds through the open space inside the Tilaurakot premises has been constructed for visitors to get a better view of the ruins of Tilaurakot.“Tilaurakot area was in a sorry state, littered with papers and plastics,” said Keshav Bhattarai of Kathmandu, comparing his fresh visit with his Tilaurakot visit four years ago. “I am very happy to see clean and beautiful Tilaurakot now.” A six-feet wide wooden walkway, constructed last year at the cost of around Rs 40 million, has helped visitors reach almost all the historically and archaeologically important places in the area.  Manoj Paudel/TKPThe Lumbini Development Trust said it plans to make Tilaurakot visitor-friendly without harming its historical and archaeological significance.A six-feet wide wooden walkway, constructed last year at the cost of around Rs 40 million, has helped visitors reach almost all the historically and archaeologically important places in the area. The trail, which winds from the western gateway to the eastern gateway, was constructed on top of a 40 cm tall cemented block based on the design prepared by Ukio Nisimura of Tokyo University who was involved in the excavation of Tilaurakot.“The walkway was constructed in line with the archaeological norms and values of Tilaurakot,” Gyanin Rai, senior administrative officer at the Lumbini Development Trust, said, adding the trail was with permission from the Department of Archeology.Ram Bahadur Kunwar, chief archaeological officer at the Department of Archeology, said development activities should be conducted cautiously in archaeologically important places. “We conducted a heritage impact assessment to construct the walkway in Tilaurakot,” he said.The Department of Archaeology and Lumbini Development Trust started excavating and exploring Tilaurakot and its surrounding areas in 2012. A geophysical survey of the Tilaurakot premises conducted in 2014 showed a 30m long, 30m wide structure in the sunken land and a wall around it. The geophysical survey revealed an empty space in the middle which is believed to be a pond. Ruins of a wall built during the Mauryan empire were recovered during an excavation last month. Maurya era bricks measuring 47 cm long, 26 to 28 cm wide and 7 cm thick were used to build the wall.The authorities concerned have also improved the sanitation of the Tilaurakot area. The bushes have been cleared in around 10 bighas of land. Two gardeners have been appointed to maintain the garden and mow grasses in the area. Prayer flags installed by devotees have also been well managed.Five resting places have been built for those wishing to meditate. The historic walls, Samayamai temple and other structures have been renovated and preserved. The historically important structures and other findings recovered during the recent excavations are preserved in such a way that the visitors can easily observe them.“The significance of Tilaurakot has increased as visitors can easily see the structures that were recovered by the recent excavation and research,” said Madhav Acharya, chief of the Tilaurakot liaison office of the Lumbini Development Trust. “It helps to highlight Tilaurakot as an archaeologically and historically important venue.”Security has also been heightened in the Tilaurakot area, with the trust mobilising 11 security guards to maintain security. Two gardeners have been appointed to maintain the garden and mow grasses in the area.  Manoj Paudel/TKPThe government had handed over the responsibility to preserve and develop Tilaurakot and other six places related to Buddha to the Lumbini Development Trust 38 years ago.Since the trust started developing Tilaurakot and its vicinity, locals are excited about the area’s prospect as a major tourist destination.“People are hopeful of development as Tilaurakot, which was neglected for years, has been well preserved now,” said Ram Kumar Yadav, a local tourist guide.Meanwhile, the government has initiated fresh efforts to enlist Tilaurakot in UNESCO's list of World Heritage Sites.According to Sanuraja Shakya, member secretary of Lumbini Development Trust, the Department of Archaeology and the Lumbini Development Trust have already submitted a preliminary report to UNESCO urging to include Tilaurakot in the world heritage site. He said the final report would be submitted in January 2023.“Tilaurakot is not only Nepal’s asset,” said Abadhesh Kumar Tripathi, vice-chairman of Lumbini Development Trust. “It is important to the entire South Asia.”","Published at : July 29, 2022",Kapilvastu,Manoj Paudel

Two provincial hospitals in Lumbini offer free health services,"The Lumbini provincial government started free health checkups from last Sunday in two major hospitals in the province—Lumbini Provincial Hospital in Butwal and Rapti Provincial Hospital in Dang.Outpatient (OPD) services, emergency tickets and general beds will be free for all patients. Likewise, blood will be provided to patients for free in all government hospitals in the province, according to the Blood Transfusion Service Centre in Lumbini.Chief Minister Kul Prasad KC announced the launch of the free health service on Sunday. Inaugurating the service, KC said that the provincial government aims to make health services accessible to all.In the budget speech for the fiscal year 2022-23, the provincial government had announced that patients in the above-mentioned hospitals will receive some financial relief during the course of their treatment. Medical Superintendent of Lumbini Provincial Hospital, Butwal, Dr Indra Dhakal confirmed that the Emergency and OPD tickets and general bed charge at the hospitals will be free. Every day, around 800 to 1,000 patients from Syangja, Baglung, Parbat and other districts of Lumbini Province come to the 520-bed Lumbini Provincial Hospital for treatment. According to Medical Superintendent of Rapti Provincial Hospital Dr Binod Singh, the hospital receives 150 to 300 patients daily for OPD services. “The start of the free health service stands to benefit patients from all financial backgrounds,” he said. “In the past, one had to pay Rs 20 for hospital tickets and Rs 50 per night for general beds.” The provincial government has also allocated funds from the social service unit for the poor and senior citizens. According to Minister of Health, Population and Family Welfare Indrajit Tharu, it was time the provincial government started providing free health services since it is the fundamental right of the citizens to receive basic health services free of charge. “It is the government’s responsibility to ensure access to free health for all,” said Tharu. According to Tharu, Lumbini Provincial Hospital spends approximately Rs 11 million annually on general and OPD services, while Rapti Provincial Hospital spends up to Rs 6 million. “It is not difficult for the provincial government to cover the expenses incurred by the free services because the budget has already been allocated for this purpose,” he told the Post. Likewise, the Blood Transfusion Service Centre will also provide free blood to patients with a doctor’s recommendation. Earlier, although blood donors donated blood for free, blood users would have to pay Rs 800 for a pint of blood, which included the cost of a blood bag. Krishna Pangeni, general secretary at the Blood Transfusion Centre, Lumbini, said that Rs 30 million has been allocated in this year’s budget to provide free blood to patients. An agreement has been signed between the Lumbini Provincial Hospital and Blood Transfusion Service Centre to that effect.","Published at : July 19, 2022",Lumbini,Sanju Paudel
Villages in Tinau at high risk,"Indra Kumari Somai of Deule in Tinau Rural Municipality-2 has not been able to sleep in her house for a year. Somai’s house was partially damaged by a landslide that swept away the hill her house sat on. “We have been sleeping in a barn for a year now. When it is not raining, we sleep on the floor of the damaged house because the barn is quite small. But when it rains we don’t stay inside the house,” said Somai. “I reached out to the authorities seeking help to rebuild my house or to move us to a safer location but no one has listened so far.” The family does not have enough money to buy land elsewhere and build a house.According to Santosh Bahadur, Indra Kumari’s son, they sought help from the Division Forest Office, District Administration Office, Land and Water Resources Office, and the local level government but no help came. Last year’s landslide in Deule also destroyed Krishna Kumari Somai’s house and cultivable land. She has built a new house on a farm in Upper Suketal village but is afraid that her new house too will be swept away by landslides.“The landslide erupted only 10 metres away from my house and I know sooner or later it will sweep my house away,” said Krishna Kumari. “We don’t get any sleep during the rainy season. Eighty families in the villages of Suketal, Deule and Paskund are in danger of landslides.”The settlements in Upper Suketal and Lower Paskund are also at high risk after the middle Deule hill was washed away by the landslide, she said.According to Parshuram Lamsal, principal of Kalika Basic School, all three villages—Deula, Suketal and Paskund—are at risk of landslides after the hill in Suketal of Tinau Rural Municipality-2 got swept away. Due to the landslide, the foundation of the school has sunk and the landmass is beginning to form cracks. “Parents have stopped sending their children to school after the foundation of the school building weakened following the landslide. Of the 150 students enrolled this year, less than 20 are attending school at present,” he said.There are 80 to 90 households in the three villages and those with the resources have moved away. But the rest of the villagers have no option but to stay back in the landslide-prone settlement. “The disaster has severely affected our lives and the education of our children,” said Lamsal. “It seems like the authorities do not care about the villagers here. Sooner or later, another disaster will take place while the authorities do nothing.”The construction of a road leading to the limestone mining area of ​​Alpha Construction and Developers Company in Suketal has also left several cracks in the landmass and this has given way to landslides. Around 10 households in the lower Suketal region are at high risk of a disaster. According to Lamsal, Dobhan Kachal River has also started eroding the Paskunda village, putting the settlement at risk of floods and landslides. According to Bhog Bahadur Lamsal, a local resident, in the last few years, the Dobhan Kachal River has breached about 10 metres of land in the area. Three years ago, roads were washed away in many places but no measures have been taken to prevent river erosion. “The municipality is aware of the situation in the three villages. We will address the issue soon,” Sundar Prasad Shrestha, chief administrative officer of Tinau Municipality, told the Post.","Published at : July 13, 2022",Palpa,Madhav Aryal
Efforts underway to declare Jagadishpur lake  as country’s second bird sanctuary,"If everything goes as planned, the picturesque Jagadishpur lake, a Ramsar wetland site in Kapilvastu district, will soon be declared Nepal’s second bird sanctuary.Conservationists and authorities concerned have been lobbying to declare the wetland as a bird sanctuary to conserve rarefied birds and promote bird tourism in the country.The division forest office in Kapilvastu has started the due process to make Jagadishpur lake a bird sanctuary after some forest, environment and eco-tourism experts recommended that the lake is ideal to be remodelled as a bird sanctuary. A team of experts, including Bishwanath Oli and Ganeshraj Joshi, studied the lake recently and submitted a report.“Letters have been dispatched to get inter-ministerial consensus to declare Jagadishpur lake as a bird sanctuary,” said Narayan Dev Bhattarai, chief of the forest management, planning and monitoring division, under the Ministry of Forest, Environment and Soil Conservation of Lumbini Province. “The declaration will promote the conservation of birds and help develop the wetland for eco-tourism.”The provincial ministry has begun the process to declare the lake as a bird sanctuary based on the report by Oli and Joshi, according to Bhattarai.Chapter 11, clause 45 of Lumbini Province’s Forest Act 2021 has the provision to declare any habitat of indigenous and migratory birds as a bird sanctuary. It is based on this legal provision that the provincial government is preparing to declare the lake as a sanctuary.The division forest office has prepared a five-year plan to develop eco-tourism in Jagadishpur lake. The forest office has proposed a total budget of Rs 236 million to implement the plan.The provincial ministry of Forest, Environment and Soil Conservation allocated Rs2.5 million budget for the upcoming fiscal year of 2022-23 to promote eco-tourism in the lake. According to Bhattarai, the shortfall will be collected from various organisations working for nature and wildlife conservation as well as from stakeholders.With the declaration, Jagadishpur lake will be the second bird sanctuary in Nepal. On March 11, Ghodaghodi wetland area in Kailali, a Tarai district in Sudurpaschim Province, was declared the country’s first bird sanctuary.Jagadishpur lake was listed as a Ramsar wetland site in August 2003. The lake is spread over an area of 157 hectares across Kapilvastu Municipality’s wards 9 and 10, and is located some 11 kilometres north of Taulihawa, the district headquarters.The lake, which was constructed in 1972-73 for the purpose of irrigation, has been a major destination for bird watching in the country. According to conservationists, of the 888 species of birds found in Nepal, 167 bird species, including grebes, cormorants, herons, egrets, stork, ducks and geese, terns and gulls, are found in the Jagadishpur lake. The lake provides shelter to 15,000 to 20,000 migratory birds that arrive from as far away as Siberia, China, Russia, Mongolia, Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan to spend the winter.","Published at : July 12, 2022",Kapilvastu,Manoj Paudel
Farmers prosper after growing chillies to be free of marauding monkeys,"Devka Bashyal of Bagnaskali Rural Municipality-8, Barangdi gave up growing maize on her small farm as monkeys were raiding the crops all the time.The growing macaque population in the area was becoming a serious problem after the animals began entering homes in the village in search of food. Besides monkeys, porcupines have been invading the farmers' fields too.So the harassed villagers decided to grow something the marauding animals would not eat.For two years now, Bashyal has been growing a very potent variety of chilli known as habanero (akabare) and asparagus, which the crop raiders do not touch. “The wild animals don’t like these crops. They don’t eat them,” Bashyal said. A local cooperative named Bagnaskali Multipurpose introduced the chilli and asparagus farming programme in the village as a solution, which has brought peace of mind to the villagers.“I didn’t earn much in the first year, but this year, I made more than Rs250,000,” said Bashyal. “If I had planted maize and other crops, I could not have protected them from the wild animals.” Another farmer, Lal Prasad Bashyal, of Barangdi was surprised to see his neighbours planting asparagus and chilli instead of the usual maize and millet crops.Seeing the sense in their ways, he also switched to asparagus and chilli. “It’s easy to protect these crops from animals, and you can make good money from them too,” he said.Animals like monkeys, porcupines, deer and boars swoop down from the surrounding forests and spread out over the fields. They had been terrorising farmers for decades.Now more than 200 farmers in the rural municipality grow asparagus and chilli, which are in great demand in the cities. They expect to sell Rs9 million worth of pepper and the vegetable this year.The cooperative is helping them with market access too. The region is becoming known for its commercial chilli and asparagus farming. But it took some time to get there.“It was difficult to convince the traditional farmers in the beginning,” said Krishna Prasad Bhusal, chairman of Bagnaskali Multipurpose Cooperative. “Habanero or akabare used to be cultivated only in the eastern hill districts.” Now a majority of farmers in Palpa are attracted to commercial farming of these two high value crops. Each farmer has planted 6,000 to 15,000 chilli seedlings. Asparagus farming has also flourished, Bhusal said.The farmers have signed an agreement to supply chilli to a number of noodle companies in the southern Tarai. Lately, farmers around the country are growing akabare chilli peppers commercially for the crop’s growing demand in Nepal and beyond.  Post File Photo“But the market for asparagus is still small,” said Bhusal. “High production has led to a glut as the usual market in Tansen could not absorb the entire output. We are exploring markets for asparagus.”Bhusal said the cooperative had assured the farmers that their harvests wouldn’t go to waste and they wouldn’t have to sell them cheaply.Deepak Bhattarai, senior agriculture development officer at the Prime Minister’s Agriculture Modernization Project Implementation Unit Office in the district, said the farmers had benefited from the land pooling programme launched by Bagnaskali Multipurpose Cooperative.“Initially, we were worried that the farmers wouldn't agree,” Bhattarai said.Production is expected to be good this year due to timely rains. Last year, 3.9 million chilli saplings and 500,000 asparagus saplings were sold in Barangdi alone.“For the next crop cycle, we are planning to sell 9 million saplings,” Bhattarai said.Habanero sells for Rs300 per kg in the local market. Asparagus sprouts are being sold for Rs400 to Rs500 per kg.Bhattarai said they were getting orders from Tansen, Butwal and Bhairahawa.In the previous fiscal year, farmer Janak Acharya of Ribdikot Rural Municipality-7, Palung Mainadi, sold chillies worth Rs5 million.This year, Ribdikot Rural Municipality has provided a subsidy for distributing 1.25 million habanero saplings.“We have talked to some noodle companies for a supply contract,” said Narayan Bahadur Karki, chairman of Ribdikot Rural Municipality. “But I do not think the noodle companies would buy all the chillies. We are in talks with other traders as well to sell the red chilli.”According to Karki, the Ribdikot area alone produces 1,000 tonnes of red chilli during one crop cycle.Last year, farmers started planting habanero as a trial in Mainadi of Palung Mainadi, Rupse of Mathagadhi, Charchare of Tinau and Barangdi of Bagnaskali.More than 200 farmers have planted it.Ranjiv Kunwar, chief of the agriculture office of Ribdikot Rural Municipality in Lumbini Province, said that commercial farming flourished this year due to the good yield.Chilli has been cultivated on 400 ropanis in Mathagadhi Rural Municipality-2, Rupse, this year. One farmer in Palung Mainadi has planted chilli on 190 ropanis of land.The Prime Minister’s Agriculture Modernization Project Implementation Unit, Palpa, has encouraged farmers to plant chilli through a land pooling farming programme. “This has been attracting returnee labourers,” said Kunwar.Farmers say one plant produces at least 2 kg of chillies.Tulsiram Bhusal, chairman of Madi Multipurpose Agriculture Cooperative, said that 33 farmers of Rupse planted chilli in the first year. Another 30 joined chilli farming this year.Tara Pandey, who lost her job in India due to the coronavirus pandemic and was forced to return, is making a good income by cultivating chillies commercially.She earned around Rs600,000 by growing the pepper on 4 ropanis.Krishna Bhattarai, secretary of Madi Multipurpose Agriculture Cooperative, said that the programme was launched with an aim to develop Rupse as a chilli pocket area.According to the Prime Minister's Agriculture Modernization Project, land pooling has been done by farmers’ groups, cooperatives and private firms as well to produce chillies.Farmer Ram Chandra Nepal of Rupse said he faced no marketing problems. “We decided to cultivate chilli to be free from wild animals. We brought the plants from Ilam,” he said.Janak Acharya, director of Triput Livestock and Agriculture Multipurpose Farm in Ribdikot Rural Municipality-7, has leased land and planted red savina pepper.“I have cultivated chilli by leasing land from six households,” ​​Acharya said.","Published at : July 3, 2022",Palpa,Madhav Aryal
Soaring costs in tiger rehabilitation worry conservation authorities,"The high upkeep cost of controlled tigers in Bardiya National Park has conservation authorities worried about the long-term impact the burgeoning cost will have on their conservation efforts. It is expensive to keep rescued and controlled tigers fed and provide treatment and care during their lifetime, say park officials.According to Bardiya National Park, a major habitat of Royal Bengal tigers in Nepal, a controlled tiger needs around six kilograms of buffalo meat every day. Tigers in the national park prey on various deer species, blue bulls and other animals when they are in the forest but rescued and controlled tigers are kept in a concrete enclosure until they start exhibiting behavioural changes indicating they are ready for assimilation into the forests.The park administration generally takes tigers that trouble people into control and those that are injured or ailing. Tigers from the Bardiya National Park have killed as many as 22 people in the past three years. The park administration controlled five tigers in the same time period. One of them broke the cage and entered the Banke National Park forests while another was sent to the central zoo in Lalitpur. Three tigers are currently kept in closed enclosures in the Rammapur and Thakurdwar areas of the national park.“The annual expenditure to keep a tiger in a closed enclosure is more than Rs 6 million,” said Bishnu Prasad Shrestha, the chief conservation officer at the Bardiya National Park. “An additional Rs 1 million needs to be spent on caretakers.”According to him, the national park has mobilised two assistant employees, one veterinary doctor and some wildlife technicians for the care of three tigers that are kept in the closed enclosures. “Treatment of tigers is also expensive. When they have minor ailments, we mix medicines in their food and give it to them orally,” said Shrestha. “But in some cases, darting them is the only option.” Controlling tigers that are either injured, diseased or violent is also not easy. “A lot goes into controlling such a tiger. We first need to identify them and then mobilise elephants, technicians, veterinary doctors and security personnel to bring them under control,” said Rabin Kadariya, Bardiya chief of the National Trust for Nature Conservation.The Bardiya National Park has three closed enclosures—two in Rammapur and one in Thakurdwar—to keep rescued or controlled tigers. An employee at the park said that the national park could not rescue or control more tigers as all three enclosures are now occupied.According to the Bardiya National Park administration, it costs approximately Rs 10 million to construct an enclosure for keeping tigers.Conservationists, however, argue that it is not good to keep tigers, which roam around the forest, in concrete enclosures. With an objective to address the issue, the Bardiya National Park has recently proposed a plan to launch an open zoo safari.The park administration recently submitted a proposal to the Ministry of Forest and Environment as well as the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation with a plan of keeping tigers, especially those brought under control for their troublesome activities and moved to the national park, in the open zoo safari. In its proposal, the national park says it plans to install iron fencing around 25 hectares of land in the park forests to keep the controlled tigers. The park administration believes this new approach will help conserve the tiger population in the country.The proposal asks for around Rs40 million budget to set up the open zoo safari, which would be the first of its kind in the country. But the proposal is yet to be approved.","Published at : July 2, 2022",Bardiya,Kamal Panthi
Khado river starts eroding embankment leaving settlements at risk of flooding,"The Khado river in Saptari district has started eroding its eastern embankment at Tilathi Koiladi Rural Municipality-1. The river breaches its embankments every monsoon, exposing several settlements to floods and inundation. According to Rajesh Jha, the disaster management officer of Tilathi Koiladi Rural Municipality, the flooded river is eroding the eastern embankment between Belhi and Sakarpura settlements in Tilathi Koiladi-1. “The river has already eroded around a metre of the embankment,” he said. The embankment that lies in ward 1 of the rural municipality is five metres wide and 50 metres long.The local residents are living in terror of the river breaching its embankment in case of heavy rainfall in the catchment area. According to Arun Kumar Mandal, chairman of Tilathi Koiladi Rural Municipality, the contractor working on the embankment’s fortification a few months ago did a shoddy job. “The contractor dug up pits to pile up boulders while constructing the embankment a few months ago. They did not fill up the pits with boulders which have left the embankment weak and exposed to breaching,” he said.Likewise, the river is also eroding the western embankment near Tilathi. Arun Kumar Mandal, the chairman of Tilathi Koiladi Rural Municipality, informed that the Kando river has started eroding its embankment in the Tilathi area as well, leaving several settlements at risk of flooding.Mandal said that the local unit has urged the Rajbiraj-based Khado River Management Project—a government agency responsible for controlling floods and carrying out flood emergency preparedness—to immediately repair the embankment but the project office has not taken the issue seriously. “The rural municipality and the ward office have initiated the repair work but our efforts are not enough to completely repair the embankment,” said Mandal. Hundreds of people from various settlements in Saptari are affected by floods in the Khado river every year during the monsoon season. But the authorities concerned do not take concrete initiatives to control such disasters in the Khado river and other water bodies in the district to protect lives and properties.According to the locals, Tilathi and Sakarpura settlements of Tilathi Koiladi Rural Municipality and Malhaniya of Kankalini Municipality will be inundated if the Kando river breaches the embankment where it has started eroding this season.The government had established the Khado River Management Project in the fiscal year 2015-16 to manage the river and protect lives and properties. However, the project has failed to take concrete initiatives to control the river, citing a lack of budget. Ekaraj Bhattarai, chief at the project office in Saptari, admitted that the recent erosion has left the embankment at risk. “But the project office is unable to immediately repair the eroded embankment due to a lack of budget,” said Bhattarai. He said the federal government has not issued a budget under emergency river control in the past two fiscal years.Hundreds of people, if not thousands, are affected by floods in several rivers and streams in Saptari district every year.

Holidays at whim: That’s the way for local governments,"When it comes to declaring public holidays, Nepal’s federal government’s frivolity was evident from its recent decision to announce and then roll back the two-day weekend.After announcing Sundays as public holiday, besides the Saturdays, on April 26, in an apparent bid to reduce the consumption of petroleum products in the wake of rapidly depleting foreign exchange reserves, the government on June 6 rolled back the decision. It faced criticism from various quarters for its flippant decision-making with many saying government officials tend to impose ideas without proper study.But such haphazard public holiday decisions are not limited to the federal government alone. Municipalities and rural municipalities over the years have come up with their own ways of declaring public holidays, at times with such reasons that defy logic, observers say.On Sunday, a rural municipality in Raipur of Rupandehi of Lumbini province declared a public holiday after a relative of its vice-chairperson died.Issuing a notice, Marchawari Rural Municipality chair Gaya Prasad Barai said that all government offices, schools and other organisations would remain closed to mourn the death of a brother-in-law of the rural municipality’s vice-chair Asha Singh.Singh’s “brother-in-law” died in a road accident on Sunday, says the notice.Expressing condolences to the family of the deceased, the rural municipality has said all schools, government offices and other organisations would remain closed on Sunday.Marchawari Rural Municipality is one of the 10 rural municipalities in Rupandehi district in Lumbini.According to its website, it is one of the most under-developed rural municipalities, with a population of 38,776 as per the national census 2011.“Since everyone from the rural municipality is going to attend the funeral, we decided to close the offices,” said Barai.On November 17 last year, Ramgopalpur Municipality in Mahottari of Madhesh Province decided to close all government offices and schools for a day because CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal was to inaugurate a function in the municipality as chief guest on that day. Issuing a notice a day before, then Mayor Ashok Kumar Mandal said since the Maoist chair and former prime minister Dahal would be inaugurating primary health centres in Wards 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9, a public holiday had been declared for November 17.In August last year, Menchhayayem Rural Municipality in Tehrathum district declared closure of ward offices and schools for a day after the vice-chair's father-in-law died.According to onlinekhabar.com, the holiday was declared after Krishna Prasad Gautam, the father-in-law of vice-chair Gita Devi Timsina, died.Upon inquiry, the rural municipality’s chair Yadav Bahadur Khapung said he decided to announce the holiday as authorised by the Local Government Operation Act, the news website reported. “It is the vice-chairperson’s father-in-law whose house is close to the rural municipality office. Hence, the municipal officials will join the funeral procession,” he told onlinekhabar. “Hence, we announced a holiday.”When Rupani Rural Municipality in Saptari district declared a public holiday on May 22, it was not to mourn anyone’s death or welcome any politician from Kathmandu.It was to celebrate the victory of new office bearers of the municipality in the May 13 local elections.A notice issued by chief administrative officer Aravind Kumar Chaudhary said all government offices, schools, public institutions and health facilities “will remain closed, as per the order of the newly elected chair Dinesh Kumar Yadav, on May 22, to celebrate the victory of new office bearers in the May 13 elections”. Some local governments, however, have come under public scrutiny for various other outlandish reasons. Even though the federal government had announced a two-day holiday by publishing a notice in the Nepal Gazette, Gorkha’s Barpak Sulikot Rural Municipality decided not to follow the decision. Bishnu Bhatta, the rural municipality chair, said that a meeting decided to continue with public holidays on Saturdays only.According to the rural municipality, since schools had just resumed in-person classes after two years due to Covid-19, the decision to implement the two-day holiday was not justified.And there was yet another notice by a ward office in Khotang recently that caught people’s attention. The office of Ward 10 of Halesi Tuwachung Municipality sought to replace the female ward secretary with a male one.In a letter undersigned by Ward 10 Chairman Arjun Kumar Puri, it called for replacing Sushila Dahal, who had been working as ward secretary at Arkhaule ward office, with a male official citing “difficulties in providing services.” Dahal was appointed ward secretary after her predecessor was transferred to another office.The ward office, citing the decision of a ward committee meeting, said that since the ward is the biggest in the municipality in terms of area and population and has to deal with a massive workload following the election of new people’s representatives, including providing additional services including vital registration, and online distribution of social security allowance from Nawalpur once a week, “a female ward secretary cannot effectively deliver the services”.“As per the decision of the ward committee meeting held on June 14, we urge [the municipality] to make arrangements for a male ward secretary,” the letter reads. Although Nepal is among a few countries with a higher number of public holidays per year, some communities are still calling for adding a few more holidays for various occasions, including local festivals. Though local government representatives say they declare public holidays as authorised by Local Level Operations Act, there is no such provision per se, while it does authorise many decisions on its own. Khim Lal Devkota, a National Assembly member and expert on federalism, says he is not aware of any legal provision allowing local governments to announce holidays for any specific event.“Such authority should not be given to local governments as it would promote the culture of declaring holidays in a haphazard manner while people may be deprived of urgent and essential services,” Devkota told the Post.“I think provinces have been given certain rights to announce province-centric holidays considering the culture and tradition of particular communities in the province which is necessary too. Essentially, national standards should be followed on holidays.”The Local Government Operation Act-2017 does not specifically speak about the authority to declare holidays.According to Devkota, the trend of announcing holidays on the death of someone close to a local official or the arrival of a senior leader of a party would set a bad precedent. “It has not been many years since local governments came into being under the federal set-up,” said Devkota. “It is time to strengthen local governments and promote good governance practices.”Nepal became a federal republic through the 2015 constitution. The 2017 elections elected three tiers of government—federal, provincial and local. After completing the first cycle, local elections were held on May 13 to elect a new set of representatives.

"Tired of waiting, farmers start planting paddy without chemical fertilisers","Sunil Ali, a farmer from Khajani, Rupandehi, has started paddy transplantation a few weeks before the normal planting season—because there was abundant water. This year, the monsoon arrived eight days earlier, on June 5, than normal, bringing cheers to farmers.Nepal’s economic wellbeing is intimately linked with the monsoon. Rainwater is the lifeblood of Nepal's Rs4.85 trillion economy which is farm-dependent, as nearly two thirds of the farmlands have no better source of irrigation.But Ali has no chemical fertiliser, a vital farm input.Fertiliser contains nutrients that plants need, such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, to boost their growth.“I need 12 sacks [1 sack is 50 kg] of chemical fertiliser for my 5 bigha [3.35 hectares] of farmland,” Ali said. The state-subsidised fertiliser was not available.“I could not bring them from India,” he said. “So I transplanted paddy without applying them.”Usually, when a fertiliser crisis grips Nepal, farmers in the country’s southern belt hop across the border to smuggle in the plant nutrients. This year, borders are regulated and police have punished many farmers for smuggling in fertiliser. “I knew that my neighbours were fined and the fertiliser they brought from India was seized,” he said. “So I gave up the idea.”On Saturday, frantic farmers of Dharke in Dhading looted two trucks loaded with chemical fertiliser as they were being escorted to Kathmandu.Video clips circulating on social media showed farmers grabbing sacks of fertilisers and running away. The incident shows the urgency of the farm inputs in the key crop transplanting season and desperation of farmers.Security personnel failed to control the frenzied crowd of farmers. Around 400 of the 500 sacks the two trucks were ferrying vanished in less than half-an-hour.The Dharke incident is an example of how desperate farmers across the country are for fertilisers.Dhiraj Yadav of Khajani, Rupandehi has 7 bigha [4.69 hectares] of farmland.He is in immediate need of 20 sacks of fertiliser but has not gotten even a grain yet.Yadav was informed by cooperatives, which distribute the state-subsidised chemical fertiliser, that it would arrive in a week. He went to ask if it had arrived. “The answer was obvious,"" he said. “Next week.”Yadav is not convinced though. But he can barely do anything. “There is no certainty when the fertiliser will come. We can't miss the good time to transplant the paddy. I did it without chemical fertiliser,” he said.Yadav is encouraged by the abundant rainfall but worried about poor harvest. Over the coming months, a major challenge for farmers will be accessing fertiliser, which may impact food production across many crops in different regions, according to the World Bank’s May report on food security.Agro experts say urea needs to be applied during the transplantation and then first top dressing—two to three weeks after transplantation.Paddy saplings have grown green in the nursery of Ashok Kurmi in Palhinandan of West Nawalparasi.Despite not having an irrigation system, he is not much concerned, as he can use water pumps to irrigate his farm. His main worry is fertiliser.The Agricultural Inputs Company, the government’s supply body, does not have enough fertiliser, he said.“If I fail to transplant the seedlings within the next few days, they will turn yellow,” Kurmi told the Post.Many farmers in India are paying huge amounts, four to five times the normal rates, according to farmers. But it’s not easy to bring them to Nepal. Some farmers have applied the di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) by purchasing it from India at Rs2,500 per sack.Ramakanta Kafle of Sunwal 7 said that local representatives have been passing the buck to the federal government.""The local representatives had committed in their election manifestos to prioritising agriculture. They had made promises that there won’t be a shortage of fertiliser,” he said. “Now it has become clear that they all lied.”Kafle says local representatives cannot shirk their responsibilities.“We voted them to serve us. Now they are blaming the federal government,” Kafle said. “They need to distribute the fertiliser even by bringing it from India. We need it now.” Local representatives say they cannot manage the fertiliser immediately as it is the federal government’s responsibility to procure and distribute them.“We are not authorised to buy chemical fertilisers,” said Shambhu Lal Shrestha, mayor of Bardaghat Municipality in Nawalparasi. “We had demanded fertilisers from the federal government but it looks like it is not immediately available. We understand preparations to acquire fertiliser for summer crops needs to be done as early as the winter.”The warehouse of Bhairahawa branch of the Agricultural Inputs Company, which is responsible for distributing fertilisers in three provinces in western Nepal, is currently empty. The company distributes fertilisers in Lumbini, Karnali, and Sudhurpaschim provinces as well as in Syangja and Nawalpur of the Gandaki Province.There is an acute shortage of farm nutrients in Lumbini, Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces at the peak paddy transplantation time. The Bhairahawa-based regional office of the Agriculture Inputs Company has received only 24,007 tonnes of urea and 16,074 tonnes of DAP since mid-July last year. Urea has yet to arrive since they ran out of it in mid-January, according to company officials.At present, the company has about 1,338 tonnes of DAP in stock. The rest has been distributed. “We have few quantities of potash and DAP in stock. This stock has been allotted for the crop pocket areas of the Prime Minister Agriculture Modernisation Project,"" said Narayan Prasad Sharma, chief of the Agricultural Input Company regional office in Bhairahawa. “We are not sure when the fertiliser will come.”Various humanitarian agencies have warned that higher fertiliser prices and a global shortage of supply due to the Russia-Ukraine war may impact food prices and production for low income countries like Nepal.Nepal’s bid to procure fertiliser from India under a government-to-government agreement has yet to yield results. Earlier this month, Agriculture Minister Mahendra Raya Yadav was in New Delhi to follow up on fertiliser procurement from India.India itself is one of the worst affected by the worldwide fertiliser crisis. India imports up to a third of its fertiliser and is the world’s biggest buyer of urea and di-ammonium phosphate.To fast-track the supply, Nepal also cleared legal hurdles. But farmers are still waiting to get the farm nutrients.Last week, the Parliament told the government to ensure chemical fertiliser by any means necessary even as countries around the globe are scrambling to avert a seemingly inevitable drop in crop yields due to a worldwide shortage of nutrients.“This is not the first time that there has been a shortage of fertiliser during the transplantion season,” said Ali, the farmer from Khajani. “This is a recurring problem every year. It’s us farmers who have been bearing the brunt of the state’s failure.”","Published at : June 20, 2022","Bhairahawa, Lumbini & Parasi","Madhav Dhungana						,"

Service seekers reluctant to renew government health policy,"Dil Prasad Sunar of Golkhada in Puthauttarganga Rural Municipality-12 got a health insurance policy of Rs 2,900 in 2018 under the government’s ‘swastha beema’ scheme for his family of six. However, he did not renew his policy this year because he could not make use of the policy when he needed it for a lack of designated healthcare facilities where the policy is accepted.“I visited the Primary Health Centre close to my house but when I reached there, I was sorely disappointed,” he said. “Not only did my insurance policy not work but even the medicines at the health post had expired.”Prem Kumari Budha of Bhume Rural Municipality-7 has also decided not to renew his family’s insurance policy this year as none of the local and district hospitals accepted the policy.Other families who had got the insurance are also reluctant to renew their policies. The majority of people from all three rural municipalities—Bhume, Sisne and Puthauttarganga—in Rukum East have decided not to renew their health insurance policy this year as neither the local health posts nor the district hospital has the provision to cover the health expenses of service seekers under the policy.The health insurance scheme was launched in the district in March 2018.According to Ganesh Oli, chairman of the district hospital management committee, the district hospital and the insurance board have only recently reached an agreement in regards to the ‘swastha beema’ scheme. “An agreement between the hospital and the insurance board has just been put in place but the insured are not getting the service. The pharmacy at the hospital is not fully operational. That is why the service seekers have not been able to avail of the health policy,” he said. Sapna Bista, registration officer of the Health Insurance Board, said that the health policy was not being put to use because the board failed to designate health institutions where the policy could be accepted. “But we have now reached an agreement with the district hospital so the service seekers can make use of the policy,” she said. In Rukum (East), around 2,373 households have signed up for the government health policy covering a total of 6,609 individuals. The highest number, 2,451 people, is from Bhume Rural Municipality, 2,178 from Sisne Rural Municipality and 1,978 from Puthauttarganga Rural Municipality.Although the local government has formulated policies, programmes and budgets prioritising the health insurance policy, not many people have signed up for it. Chairman of Bhume Rural Municipality Homprakash Shrestha said that the local unit will put more focus on health insurance in the next five years. “Our aim is to make affordable treatment accessible to the majority of the population,” he said. “The rural municipality authorities have decided to formulate policies, programmes and budget accordingly.”","Published at : June 19, 2022",Rukum (east),Hari Gautam
Lumbini Province Health Minister Bimala Oli Khatri in police custody on charge of assault,"An indecent behaviour complaint has been filed against Lumbini Province Health Minister Bimala Khatri Oli.Mina Bhandari Basnet, 27, of Tulsipur Sub-Metropolitan City in Dang, took the complaint to Area Police Office, Tulsipur alleging misbehaviour at the hands of the minister. As per the complaint, minister Khatri entered Basnet’s home and allegedly hurled verbal abuses, assaulted and misbehaved with the latter and her infant daughter.Even though the complaint has been presented at the Area Police Office, it has not been registered. According to Inspector Ranjit Swar, acting Chief at the Area Police Office, since the accused has been kept under the custody of District Police Office, Ghorahi, the complaint will also be sent to the district for registration.A police team from the Area Police Office had taken Khatri into custody after locals complained of her presence at Basnet’s home. The locals had even protested outside the police office demanding action against the minister.District Police Office Chief SP Suresh Kafle informed that Khatri is being detained at the police office and investigation is underway regarding the incident. “We are further investigating the details,” said Kafle. As per the complaint, Khatri had reached Ekraj Basnet’s house in Tulsipur Sub-metropolitan-5, Dang, when he was not at home. After Mina opened the door, Khatri burst in and asked for Ekraj claiming that he was her husband.According to Mina, her husband Ekraj has not been in the house for the past four days and is out of contact. Meanwhile, reports of an affair between Ekraj and minister Khatri had surfaced in August-September, 2021 after a photo of the duo was made public in a Facebook post. Both of them had denied being in a relationship during that time. Oli was elected as a provincial assembly member from the then Nepal Communist Party (NCP) on November 30, 2019, during a by-election after she was given the party ticket following the demise of her husband Uttar Kumar Oli.

"Ruins of Maurya-era wall unearthed in Tilaurakot, Kapilvastu","Ruins of a wall built during the Mauryan empire have been recovered during an excavation in Tilaurakot, Kapilvastu. Maurya era bricks measuring 47 cm long, 26 to 28 cm wide and 7 cm thick were used to build the wall.According to archeologists involved in the excavation, the findings of the wall ruins have archaeological significance. “The wall with nine-ten layers of bricks has been recovered in the middle of Tilaurakot. Additional information will certainly be discovered when it is unearthed to the natural soil level,” said Himal Uprety, archaeological officer of Lumbini Development Trust.The Department of Archaeology and Lumbini Development Trust started excavating and exploring Tilaurakot, an ancient Shakya capital city where Siddhartha Gautam spent his princely life before he became the Buddha, and its surrounding areas in 2012.A geophysical survey of the Tilaurakot premises conducted in 2014 showed a 30m long, 30m wide structure in the sunken land and a wall around it. The geophysical survey revealed an empty space in the middle which is believed to be a pond. The fresh excavation found the walls encircling the pond.During an excavation in 2016/17, archaeologists had discovered the south-west and the south-east corners of the pond. The fresh finding of the wall ruins has been linked to those two corners, said archeologists involved in the excavation.A group of archaeologists from the Department of Archaeology and the Lumbini Development Trust unearthed the area for about a month by using modern technology. A one metre wide, one-and-a-half metres deep and 24 metres long trench was dug during the excavation. Some earthen pots, copper coins and statues of animals were found during the excavation.Various structures and goods from around 2,400 years ago, which was confirmed by carbon dating, were recovered at different times during the excavations. “Such findings justify the historical evidence of Tilaurakot. The fresh excavation was conducted as per the geophysical survey,” said Bhaskar Gyawali, an officer at the Department of Archaeology.The recent excavations, according to archaeologists, have been very crucial as they are helpful in the process of enlisting Tilaurakot in UNESCO’s world heritage list. The government plans to include Tilaurakot in the world heritage list.","Published at : June 13, 2022",Kapilvastu,Manoj Paudel
Deforestation for development leading to environmental degradation,"Deforestation has increased exponentially in the name of development in the last few years. The construction of roads, transmission lines and other physical infrastructures cutting through forest areas has destroyed the forest cover across the country. Mushrooming human settlements around big infrastructure projects compounded by lax monitoring on the part of the local, provincial and federal governments to control the encroachment of wide open spaces have led to massive environmental degradation, especially in the Chure and Mahabharata regions. “Trees are being felled to make way for transmission lines. Community and national forests are being cleared for the expansion of power transmission lines. Deforestation is taking place on a massive scale in five community forests of Hattilung in Mathagadhi Rural Municipality-5,” said Dhanisara Somai of Hattilung in Mathagadhi Rural Municipality, Palpa.The 220 KV Kaligandaki Corridor Transmission Line Project that spans across Parbat, Syangja, Palpa, Rupandehi and Nawalparasi West covers a distance of 86 km and requires clearance of at least 25 hectares of forest cover, according to the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA).Conducting Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) is mandatory under Environment Protection Act 2076/2077 when clearing more than five hectares of forest area. The EIA is the calculation of the environmental consequences (positive and negative) of a development project done prior to the implementation of any project; whereas, the IEE describes the environmental condition of a project, its impacts and its mitigation measures.However, in the power line transmission project in Mathagadhi, Palpa, only the preliminary environmental test, IEE, has been conducted so far. According to Sanyog Basnet, information officer of the Division One Office, Palpa, the NEA’s Kaligandaki Corridor Transmission Line Project office has taken permission to cut down trees for the transmission line project. But trees have been cut down indiscriminately in Malouta Chowpari, Toklakdi, Matha, Bhavana and Goredada community forests under Mathagadhi Rural Municipality-5, Hattilung. A total of 1,697 trees have been cut down in Matha forest in Mathagadhi Rural Municipality alone for the transmission line. According to the division forest office, the project has permission from the Department of Forest to cut 4,785 trees in Palpa district for the project.According to the Division Forest Office, permission has been granted to cut down trees additionally in Kuber, Chilangdi and Kalika community forests in Tansen Municipality and Pushpaka Community Forest in Bagnaskali Rural Municipality. The Division Forest Office and Sub-Division Office should be present to oversee the felling of trees for infrastructural projects and to regulate and mark the area where the trees have been cut down. However, none of the forest officials is present when trees are being felled for the power transmission project in Mathagadhi, say locals.“The number of trees cut down in the forests is unknown. Only inspection and monitoring reports by the Sub-Divisional Forest Office, Mathagadhi will determine the exact number of trees felled,” said Basnet. “Without proper reports, we cannot take any action.”In the forests, contractors have cut down trees indiscriminately and heavy machinery like bulldozers has been put to use, but the sub-division office has not taken any action against the contractors. Gun Bahadur Saru, a resident of Mathagadhi, says the local community was taken by surprise when the contractors started felling trees in the forests. “We came to know about the project only when we saw trees being cut down,” said Saru. “The contractors are cutting down trees using heavy machinery. If this continues, it will take a long time for the forest to recover from such massive destruction.” Chiranjeevi Chaulagain, an environment officer of the project, says the authorities granted permission to cut down trees for the project without seeking an EIA. “The government must have granted permission to cut down trees on the basis of the IEE,” said Chaulagain. According to the locals, the lack of detailed environmental study has led to the drying up of water sources and an increase in episodes of floods and landslides in the lower regions. The local residents have been lodging complaints almost every year with the Division Forest Offices against deforestation in the name of the transmission line project and road construction in different places of Rainadevi Chhahra Rural Municipality and Tinau Rural Municipality in Palpa. But the authorities have not responded to the complaints, say locals.In Dang, more than 20 hectares of national forest have been cleared in Bhalubang Bazaar of Rapti Rural Municipality with around 1,200 households settled inside the forest area in the past few years. Several buildings have been built and buying and selling of property without legal documents have become the norm. Jagat Pokhrel of Bhalubang, former president of Rapti Chamber of Commerce and Industry, says the real estate market has taken off in the area with no consideration for the protection of the forest cover.The Division Forest officials in Dang say they are obligated to work alongside authorities in the electricity, telecom and roads sectors in the name of development. “Of late, the conflict between saving the environment and making headway with development for the country has been increasing,” said Chief of the Division forest Office, Dang, Mohan Shrestha. “The local units are chopping down trees to construct roads and playgrounds and dig ponds all in the name of infrastructure development. We have stopped some people from working against the Environment Act and regulations but it is happening at such a large scale that our intervention is proving futile.”Deforestation in the name of development is a serious issue in Dang. Chief of the District Coordination Committee in Dang Jitendra Man Nepali said that the situation has not come under control even after increasing the monitoring mechanism.In Arghakhanchi, forest cover has been cleared to reach the settlements of Sitganga Municipality, which has one of the largest forest areas in the district. Large trees have been cut down in the name of road expansion. According to the locals, the forest was cleared to take the road to the village with the connivance of the contractor company and the officials of the Forest Users Committee. “The trend of cutting down big trees and selling timber from the road construction site is increasing. Two to three roads have been constructed here just to connect one village to the road network,” said Pharsa Bahadur Khatri, a local.According to Khatri, the local residents have filed several complaints with the authorities regarding the haphazard and excessive deforestation in the forest areas.Chumkala Bhat of Simalpani village says deforestation in the Chure area has led to floods, landslides, destruction of irrigation canals and inundation of paddy fields every year. According to the Division Forest Officer Madan Dhungana, they have expressed their concerns to the local units time and again about the indiscriminate felling of trees and use of heavy machinery. “But the people’s representatives themselves shut us out. Development is necessary but development is also possible without destroying the environment,” said Dhungana.","Published at : June 11, 2022","Palpa, Dang & Arghakhanchi","Madhav Aryal						,"
Bardiya residents are paying the brutal price of tiger conservation,"On the evening of February 22, Lily Chaudhary was feeding her pigs near her house in Sainabagar, Thakurbaba Municipality in Bardiya. It was around half-past eight. She was oblivious to the fact that a tiger was on the prowl. And suddenly, the royal Bengal tiger pounced upon her and started dragging her towards the forest. She shouted for help. Neighbours sprung into action. Distracted by the noise, the tiger retreated, leaving Lily. But she had already been mauled to death. Lily was a single mother for the last 10 years, raising her two children alone—son Aakash and daughter Nisha. Aakash had just taken the tenth grade exam. Nisha had joined the Nepal Army. “We lost our mother. A few days back the tiger came back and took a pig from the barn,” said Aakash. “Now I feel scared to step out of the house in the evening. I cannot even go to the toilet.” Aakash and Nisha  Tufan Neupane/TKPTheir house is about 100 metres north of the East-West Highway. Since Lily’s death, her sister Asmita has been taking care of Aakash.On August 25, 2019, Pahariya Tharu of Sri Ramnagar of the same municipality was attacked by a tiger while tending to his pigs. Neighbours chased the tiger away by shouting but Tharu was seriously injured in the attack and died before he could be taken to the hospital.His daughter-in-law Santrani said they stopped rearing pigs after the incident.Those who do not have their own land have no other source of income except animal husbandry.“We were making a living by raising pigs but now we have stopped doing that. No one in the village does that anymore. For us it has become very difficult to survive,” she said. “Pigs were a good source of income, but we cannot take the risk of losing family members. Life is hard here, but we have nowhere else to go.”Bardiya in recent years has become a success story in tiger conservation. The Bardia National Park (BNP) is set to receive the International Award TX2 in Russia this year for making significant strides in tiger conservation.The BNP will share the award with India's Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve during the second Global Tiger Summit this year.According to the 2009 census, 18 tigers were found in the BNP and the buffer zone, but in 2018, the number had reached 87, an almost fivefold increase.While the number of tigers has risen, so has the number of people who have lost their lives.Since 2019, as many as 23 people have died in tiger attacks in Bardiya alone, according to the National Trust for Nature Conservation. Six people have been killed in Banke.The BNP is one of the five protected areas in Nepal that harbour tiger population. The other tiger sanctuaries are Parsa National Park, Chitwan National Park, Banke National Park and Shuklaphanta National Park. The BNP is the largest national park spread across 968 square kilometres in the lowland plains.Nepal’s tiger conservation has earned global recognition with the number of wild cats recorded at 235 in the 2018 census, up from 121 in 2009, taking the country close to doubling the tiger population, a commitment adopted at the St Petersburg Global Tiger Summit in 2010.  Tufan Neupane/TKPWhile Nepal’s anti-poaching efforts have led to significant gains and earned international praise, the human cost at which these results have been obtained has often been ignored, both by the government and conservation organisations, experts say.Bharati Pathak, president of the Federation of Community Forestry Users Nepal, finds fault with the conservation model the country has adopted that only aims to protect the wildlife while completely overlooking the need to make programmes for human-wildlife coexistence.“Our concept of conservation overlooks the livelihood issues of the people. This method of just protecting the wildlife while leaving the people to die is not sustainable,” she said. “Tharus of Bardiya harvesting snails and Chepangs of Chitwan going to pluck fiddlehead ferns are being killed by tigers. What is the capacity of the national parks? How many tigers can a park sustain? Should conservation come at human costs?”According to her, the government agencies appear to be completely apathetic towards the families of those killed in wildlife attacks.“The celebrations over increase in the numbers are a disrespect to the families of those killed in wildlife attacks,” she said.According to officials, the government provides Rs1 million to a family if a member is killed in a tiger attack. Besides this, there is no other kind of support.Asmita, Lily’s sister, says she is struggling hard to finance her nephew Aakash’s education.“We are told there is no other scheme for people like us whose family members die in tiger attacks,” said Asmita. “Locals have repeatedly requested the authorities to put up a wall between the park area and the residential areas but all they have done is circle the park with a thin wire which tigers easily breach.”According to Bishnu Prasad Shrestha, chief conservation officer of Bardia National Park, ever since the rise in the number of tiger attacks was reported, they have been trying to address the problem.“We have developed a five-year strategy in association with the federal, provincial and local governments as well as the Federation of Community Forestry Users Nepal and those working in the field of conservation, to minimise human-wildlife conflict,” said Shrestha. “Most of the incidents have occurred in the forest areas. So we have been trying to provide alternative ways of livelihoods to those impoverished families that depend on the forests.”According to him, in the last five years, at least five man-eater tigers have been taken into control.“We have installed a satellite collar on at least one tiger and we are planning to do the same for three more tigers,” he said.As the BNP is set to receive the International Award TX2, a second award for Tiger Conservation Excellence will be presented to the Khata Forest Conservation Area, also known as the Khata corridor. A desolate area for grazing cows until a decade and a half ago, the 38-square-kilometre corridor is now a forest full of trees, shrubs and grasslands and which serves as transboundary connectivity for elephants, rhinos and tigers between Nepal’s BNP and India’s Katarniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary. Established in 2010, the corridor has earned a fair share of accolades for its contributions in the field of conservation.  Tufan Neupane/TKPBut the more the movements of wildlife through the corridor, the more risks for humans.Kaushika Pal, 49, of Kothiya village in Madhuwan Municipality, lost her life in a tiger attack on May 24.According to District Forest Officer Pravin Bidari of the Division Forest Office, Pal was attacked by a tiger in Janajagriti Community Forest which is near the Khata corridor.Earlier this week, Asmita Tharu from the same locality was attacked by a tiger. She survived. But local residents launched a protest demanding protection from wildlife. In the name of diffusing the protest, police opened fire, resulting in the death of Navina Tharu, 18, of Madhuwan.The locals stopped the protest from Thursday after an eight-point agreement.On March 10, 2021, Renuka Sunar of Kothiaghat, Madhuwan, was killed by a tiger while she was cutting grass for goats inside the Kothiaghat Community Forest.“I too had gone to the forest with my daughter-in-law to collect fodder that day. However, after the incident I have stopped visiting the forest again,” said Kaushila Sunar.Kaushila, 61, who has lived in the area for 43 years, said she had never heard of such regular tiger attacks in the past.“It killed my daughter-in-law. Now such tiger attacks are not limited to forests, as incidents of tigers killing baby goats from sheds near houses have become common,” she said. “We live in constant fear.”On October 27, 2020, four months before Renuka was killed by a tiger, Dinesh Tharu of Dhanaura in Madhuwan was mauled to death by a tiger in the forest, where he had gone to search for mushrooms in the forest.Ramesh, the brother-in-law, who had gone in search of Dinesh also did not return.Ramita Chaudhary lost her brother (Ramesh) and husband (Dinesh) in tiger attacks on the same day.“Raising two daughters alone is difficult. The tiger destroyed my family,” she said.Dinesh and Ramesh were married to each other's sisters. Just like Ramita lost her husband and brother, Pooja also lost her brother (Dinesh) and husband (Ramesh).“When we learned that my brother Dinesh was attacked by a tiger, we all went to see if he could be found alive,” said Pooja, 25. “But suddenly the tiger leapt out of nowhere and pounced upon my husband (Ramesh). We could not save him.”She has two daughters—one is a third grader and another first grader. Ramesh used to work as a mason.“With the sole breadwinner of the family gone, it has become extremely difficult to raise my children as I don’t have any other source of income,” she said.Locals say they are extremely concerned about their safety in the wake of the rising number of wildlife attacks, particularly tiger.Rabin Kadaria, head of the National Trust for Nature Conservation in Bardiya, says wildlife and the safety of the community should go hand in hand.“The locals are dependent on the forest, so we cannot ask them to stop visiting the forest. On the other hand, regular attacks are being reported in the area,” said Kadaria. “All levels of government and other organisations need to work together. If measures are taken to reduce community dependence on forests then such attacks can be reduced.”Nepal’s tiger conservation efforts would not have been successful without partnerships with and support from local communities. But the increasing number of attacks now has put a spotlight on the conservation model. Experts say the time has come to assess the campaign to save tigers if it is ignoring the human cost of conservation.“Until recently, our focus was on mitigating the risks faced by the endangered wildlife,” said Kumar Poudel, who works in the field of wildlife conservation. “But its cost is getting higher. People are dying. There is a need to put the community’s interest at the centre while running any conservation campaign.”According to Poudel, people-centred approaches are a must.“How many tigers or other endangered animals do we need… or how many of them can we protect? Which are the best habitats to protect them? After figuring these out, we need to take into consideration how can we take the communities into confidence in the conservation efforts?” he said. “How to protect the communities? Or else, we may be able to protect the wildlife but at the cost of human lives. That’s the brutal price for conservation.”Kamal Panthi contributed reporting.","Published at : June 11, 2022",Bardiya,Tufan Neupane
Butwal-Narayanghat road nowhere near complete,"As per the project agreement, road widening work of the Butwal-Narayanghat section of the East-West Highway should be completed by August 8 this year. However, the road work is nowhere near completion.According to the Butwal-Narayanghat Road Expansion project office, only around 17 percent of the road widening work has been completed as of mid-May.“The road expansion work is going on at a snail’s pace. The project deadline is two months away but only about 17 percent of the work has been completed. At this rate, it will take more than nine years for the project to complete,” said Ramesh Kumar Disti, the eastern section chief of the Butwal-Narayanghat road project.The Department of Roads signed an agreement with China State Construction Engineering Corporation to implement the road project in February 2019. As per the plan, the existing two-lane road has to be widened to six lanes within four years. The project office had divided the Butwal-Narayanghat road into two sections—48km Daunne-Gaidakot section in the east and 66-km Daunne-Butwal section in the west.Road widening work along the 114km Butwal-Narayanghat section, one of the busiest road stretches along the East-West Highway, was initiated with Rs 17 billion loan assistance from the Asian Development Bank.According to the road project, work has been delayed mainly due to the issue of felling trees along the road, shifting electricity poles from the roadside and due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Forty-four kilometres of the 114km long Butwal-Narayanghat road section pass through forests. “Forty-four kilometres of the 114km long Butwal-Narayanghat road section pass through forest areas so several trees along the road have to be cut for the road widening project. This has caused some delays,” said an engineer of the road project preferring anonymity. “Work has also been disrupted in some places due to the issue of shifting utility poles.” He said that the project cost would increase due to the delay in project completion.The China State Construction Engineering Corporation recently wrote an application to the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport urging them to extend the project deadline by two years. Rakesh Jha, an engineer of the Chinese construction company, admitted the project delay. He said that the Covid-19 pandemic, issues of tree felling on the roadside and shifting of electricity poles are the leading causes behind the project delay.“We have focused on bridge construction rather than road widening works,” said Jha. “Especially with the onset of monsoon, we are unable to continue road leveling works as the rainwater sweeps away the soil.”A total of 222 bridges have to be constructed along the 114 km long Butwal-Narayanghat road. However, only 115 bridges have been constructed so far.The delay in the expansion work of the Butwal-Narayanghat road has put it in a sorry state. The road is full of potholes, making the busy stretch of the East-West Highway prone to accidents. The road project has also diverted the roads in various places for the construction of bridges and expansion works, causing hours-long traffic jams.“The road is full of potholes. Travelling along the road, mainly in the rainy season, is risky here,” said Remesh Khanal, a truck driver who often uses the road section. He complained that the travel time has more than doubled since the road expansion project began. “The road would be safer and easier to use if those potholes were buried and the road was levelled.”The local people blame both the government and the contractor for the poor condition of the existing road and the delay in the road widening project. “There are big potholes along the diversion road. The drivers cannot see them well during the night, which often leads to accidents. Neither the government authorities nor the contractor are concerned with burying such potholes along the road,” said Ramchandra Sapkota, a resident of Gaindakot.Meanwhile, Suman Ghimire, the chief district officer of Nawalparasi (East), claims that he has repeatedly instructed the Chinese company and the Department of Roads to bury the potholes and improve the road condition but to no avail.","Published at : June 9, 2022",Nawalparasi (east),Narayan Sharma
Bardiya residents continue protest following death of teenager in clash with police,"Residents of Madhuban Municipality in Bardiya continued their protest for the second consecutive day on Tuesday after an 18-year-old girl died of bullet wounds during Monday’s clash with the police.On Monday, Madhuban locals obstructed the Gulariya-Rajapur road section of the Postal Highway demanding protection from wild animals after Asmita Tharu, 41, of Sonaha in Madhuwan-2 of the district got injured in a tiger attack while collecting firewood the same day.During their protest on Monday, the locals demanded commitment from the forest chief and the chief district officer to control wildlife menace in the area. A clash occurred between security personnel and the local residents during the protest, following which police personnel lobbed tear gas shells and opened fire. Nabina Tharu, 18, of Madhuwan-2 got hit by a bullet and died during the course of treatment at a hospital.As many as 20 security personnel and one civilian, Rakesh Chaudhary, were also injured in the clash. The injured are currently receiving treatment at Nepalgunj Nursing Home. On Tuesday, scores of people from different villages arrived at Orali Bazaar in Madhuban Municipality to protest the teenager’s death and underscore their demand for protection from wild animal attacks. Bastola informed that security personnel were not present in the protest site on Tuesday to avoid untoward incidents. “We, however, deployed police personnel in the neighbouring areas to maintain peace and security,” said Bastola.  Post PhotoFollowing the incident, the Home Ministry on Tuesday formed a committee to probe into the teenager’s death. According to a statement from the ministry, the committee is headed by Joint Secretary Hari Prasad Ghimire.The Ghimire-led committee has been asked to submit its report within seven days.Incidents of wildlife attacks along the Khata Bio-Corridor in Madhuban Municipality have been on a rise for the past few years. Tiger attacks alone have claimed the lives of nine people along the bio-corridor in the last three years.According to local residents, 13 days prior to the attack on Asmita Tharu, Kaushika Pal, another local woman, had also sustained injuries in a tiger attack in the bio-corridor. The 49-year-old woman was grazing her goats in the Janajagriti Community Forest when the tiger attacked her.An all-party meeting held at Madhuban Municipality on Tuesday concluded serious negligence on the part of the police administration in dealing with Monday’s protest. Participants in the meeting accused the police of blindly firing at the protesters.CPN (Maoist Centre) leader Suresh Panth, who was at the meeting, said that action will be taken against those who gave orders to open fire at the protesters.“We have urged the government to compensate the family of Nabina Tharu, who was killed during the protest,” said Panth, “Likewise, the government will bear all treatment costs of Chaudhary, the civilian who sustained bullet injuries in Monday’s protest.”The meeting also decided that the government will bear the treatment cost of Asmita Tharu, who was injured in the tiger attack on Monday.Likewise, the meeting has decided to manage the human-wildlife conflict, monitor tiger movements and secure human settlements, among other long term solutions to the crisis, by coordinating with the province, centre, national park and forest division office, among other stakeholders.","Published at : June 7, 2022",Bardiya,Kamal Panthi

Nine dead in early morning bus accident,"Nine people died while more than 23 were injured in a bus accident near Bhairahawa early Sunday morning.The passenger bus en route to Bhairahawa from Janakpur swerved off the bridge over Rohini River along the Bhairahawa-Parasi section of the Postal Highway at around 4:30am. The bus plunged some 25 feet below. The incident site is about four km east of Bhairahawa in Rupandehi district.According to the District Police Office in Rupandehi, there were 32 people on board when the incident occurred. Police identified eight of the deceased while the identity of one is yet to be ascertained.The security personnel of Nepal Police and Armed Police Force reached the incident site after 10 minutes and rescued the victims with the help of the local people. The rescuers used three excavators to retrieve the passengers trapped under the bus.The rescued passengers were rushed to Bhim Hospital and Universal Teaching Hospital in Bhairahawa. Four people died while receiving treatment at Bhim Hospital while the other five died at Universal Teaching Hospital, said police.Twenty one people injured in the accident are receiving treatment at Universal Medical College while two others returned home after treatment. The hospital source said the injured are not in a critical condition.It is suspected that the fatal accident might have taken place because the driver dozed off while driving the vehicle. Preliminary police investigation also shows overspeeding to be another cause.“I was asleep when the incident occurred. Almost all the passengers were sleeping. I came to know of the accident only after the bus plunged into the river. I smashed a window pane and came out. The security personnel took me to the hospital later,” said Wakil Das, 19, of Rautahat who sustained injuries in the incident.“Detailed investigation into the incident is underway,” said Deputy Superintendent of Police Nabaratna Paudel.However, bus driver Suman Aryal, who was also injured in the crash, claimed that the incident occurred as he was attempting to save a vehicle coming from the opposite direction. “The vehicle did not dim its headlight. I lost control of the bus as I tried not to crash into it,” said Aryal from the hospital bed.","Published at : June 5, 2022",Bhairahawa,Madhav Dhungana
No escape from poverty for marginalised Chidimars,"On May 29, the day the budget was made public in the federal parliament, Gita Chidimar, from the marginalised Tarai Dalit community, was worried about drinking water. The Chidimar settlement in Hawaldarpur, Kohalpur Municipality-14, does not have a single source of safe drinking water. “There is no drinking water, no food grains, no land for farming,” says Gita. “When we work we get food to eat, when we don’t we starve.”While Finance Minister Janardan Sharma was unveiling a budget of Rs. 1.793 trillion in the joint sitting of the Federal Parliament, the people of the Chidimar community were struggling for their basic needs. When asked what the budget announcement means to Gita, she says she doesn’t understand.Koili Chidimar, another local of Kohalpur, says she has been travelling far from her settlement every day to look for cow dung, which she uses instead of costly firewood to cook food. “But these days no one gives away dung for free,” she said. “We have to travel far to find cow dung. There are many more problems we have been facing here.” Koili also lamented the budget. “I heard the government did not bring any plans or policies for Chidimars this year,” she said. “I don’t know how that will affect us since we have never felt the presence of the government in our lives.”This year’s budget has not touched on the economic plight of the endangered Chidimars, who have spent three generations in search of food, shelter and clothes. The federal government plans to roll out the ‘One House, One Stream’ campaign in coordination with the state and local governments but the Chidamar community is not included on the list of beneficiaries.As in the previous year, this year's budget has also stated that 100,000 houses will be constructed and distributed for the marginalised and endangered castes under the public housing programme. But Ramlakhan Chidimar from Hawaldarpur says three generations of his family have waited for a house they were supposed to receive. “When we ask the authorities to build a house for us in accordance with the government plan, they tell us those who don’t have their own land do not get a house,” said Ramlakhan. “But if we had land and property, we wouldn’t have to beg with the government to build us a house.” Different governments have come into power since the country adopted federalism in 2017, but the situation of the extremely poor and endangered people like Chidimar has not changed. So far, the government’s plans and policies have not been able to address the grievances and struggles of marginalised and endangered Chidimar. The Chidimar community traditionally made a living by bird hunting. With changing times, their profession has disappeared but has not been replaced with any other income-generating means. Years of poverty have led to the lack of education, skills and therefore income in the community. Children hardly attend school and without the government’s intervention find themselves without an education.“We never got the opportunity to learn new things that could help us make a living,” said Hamesh Chidimar of Belaspur, another Chidimar settlement in Nepalgunj sub-metropolitan-14. “The people in the government never take us into consideration when making plans and policies for the poorer marginalised communities.”There are around 3,000 Chidimars living in different places in Banke district such as Nepalgunj, Shamshergunj, Indrapur, Holiya, Betahani and Kohalpur. The newly-elected ward chairman of Kohalpur-14, Namba Bahadur Ale Magar, says he will include the Chidimar community in all development plans he plans to initiate. “We hope to improve the condition of the Chidimar community in the next year with targeted programmes for the community members,” said Magar. “We will focus on providing health, education, shelter and food.”","Published at : June 4, 2022",Kohalpur,J Pandey
Bardiya National Park proposes setting up open zoo,"Bardiya National Park, a major habitat of Royal Bengal tigers in Nepal, proposes a plan to launch an open zoo safari.The park administration has recently submitted a proposal to the Ministry of Forest and Environment as well as the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation with a plan of keeping tigers, especially those brought under control for their troublesome activities and moved to the national park, in the open zoo safari. “The establishment of an open zoo safari will conserve the rescued tigers and promote tourism in the national park. There will be no need to confine the troublesome tigers in a narrow enclosure,” said Bishnu Prasad Shrestha, chief conservation officer at the Bardiya National Park. According to him, the national park designed the proposal to let the tigers that are rescued or controlled for their injuries or troublesome activities roam in an open and natural place.In its proposal, the national park says it plans to install an iron fencing around 25 hectares of land in the park forests to keep the controlled tigers. The park administration believes this new approach will help tiger conservation in the country.The proposal asks for around Rs40 million budget to set up the open zoo safari, which would be the first of its kind in the country. The national park is hopeful that the ministry will accept its proposal and release the budget in the upcoming fiscal year of 2022-23.The national park is all set to commence construction of the open zoo safari immediately after the ministry approves the budget. The park employees claim that the national park will generate revenue by selling tickets to the visitors at the open zoo safari.The national park plans to build view towers with telescopes in the open zoo area and construct sky bridges linking such towers. The tourists, according to the park administration, can observe the tigers from the view towers and sky bridges.Technicians have suggested establishing the open zoo in the forests that lie near the Karnali River, according to Shrestha.The rescued or controlled tigers which roam around the forest have to be kept in the concrete enclosure due to the lack of open spaces in national parks. Conservationists are upbeat about the concept of open zoo safari.“The proposal of establishing the open zoo in 25 hectares of land with enough natural space for the tigers to roam is praiseworthy,” said Ramesh Kumar Thapa, the former chief conservation officer of the Bardiya National Park. “The open zoo should have bushes where the tigers can take rest and natural flowing water.” Thapa added the act of confining wild beasts like tigers in a concrete cage is very unscientific and inhumane.Tigers from the Bardiya National Park have killed as many as 22 people in the past three years. The park administration controlled four tigers. One among them broke the cage and entered the Banke National Park forests while another was sent to the central zoo in Lalitpur. Two tigers are kept in closed enclosures in Rammapur and Thakurdwar areas of the national park. Bardiya National Park and India’s Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve jointly won this year’s TX2 Award for doubling their tiger populations since 2010. TX2 is one of the most ambitious conservation goals ever set for a single species.The Bardiya National Park, which covers an area of 968 sq km, earned accolades for posting an impressive growth in tiger population by almost five-fold—from less than 20 tigers in 2009 to 87 in 2018.","Published at : May 27, 2022",Bardiya,Kamal Panthi
Students in Rolpa apply theoretical knowledge in farming,"Sugam Roka Magar studies at Rangkot-based Nepal Rastriya Secondary School, Rolpa. Alongside his studies, Sugam also takes out his time to work in his family’s vegetable fields.A student of grade nine, Sugam says working in the fields gives him a deeper insight into what he learns in the classroom. “I am learning by doing. I apply what I learn at school in the fields and experiment with different techniques to see what works,” said Sugam. Nepal Rastriya Secondary School runs classes on agriculture as a technical subject from grade nine to twelve. Sugam is one of the students who have enrolled for the course. Sugam’s classmate Pratap Gharti Magar is also happy to be able to apply his theoretical knowledge in the fields and see his hard work come to fruition. “I put whatever I learn in class to practice. My parents grow vegetables like potatoes, onions and cauliflowers and I help them get a better yield by adopting the lessons I learn in the classroom,” he said.Like Nepal Rastriya Secondary School, Thawang-based Balabhadra Secondary School and Siddhartha Model Secondary School in Jinbang have also been running classes on agriculture as a technical subject for the past six years. Hundreds of students from Thawang, Jinabang and Rangkot have signed up for the lesson at these educational institutions.  Post PhotoBoth the students and teachers think teaching-learning activities have proven effective as students get the opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge in real life. Surendra Kumar Chaudhary, a teacher at Nepal Rastriya Secondary, said that the school administration and the teachers have emphasised imparting practical skills along with theoretical knowledge. “The main objective of technical education is to be able to implement theoretical knowledge in practical terms,” said Chaudhary.According to Gopal KC, the headmaster at Nepal Rastriya Secondary School, two different programmes—students and guardians programme at home and teachers and students programme at school—have been launched for practical education.“Students of the agriculture course have been providing help to their guardians in identifying diseases, controlling insects and diseases as well as spraying insecticides/pesticides in the farms,” said KC.There are altogether 850 students in Nepal Rastriya Secondary School. Among them, 190 have enrolled in agricultural studies as a technical subject this academic year.The students and teachers of Birbalabhadra Secondary School in Thawang produce lemon, kiwi, mushrooms and other green vegetables. According to Amar Shrestha, coordinator of crop science at the school, the teachers and students have planted crops in around 15 ropanies of land. “We work for two hours in the field twice a week. We practice what we learn in the class,” said Aayush CN, a 10th grader at the school.  Post PhotoIn recognition of their exemplary work, the federal government decided to provide assistance to Nepal Rastriya Secondary School in Rangkot; Balabhadra Secondary School in Thawang and Siddhartha Model Secondary School in Jinbang under the President Educational Reform Programme this year. The Ministry of Education, Science and Technology will provide Rs 1 million each to the schools annually under the programme. The amount under the programme is to be used to increase students’ involvement in agricultural productions and livestock farming.“We are happy to be selected for the President Educational Reform Programme. Our school has become a model school in the district with the support provided by the government at different times,” said Ajaya Gharti Magar, the school management committee chairman of Balabhadra Secondary School in Thawang. “The school will fully utilise the amount provided under the programme for the practical education of the students.”","Published at : May 23, 2022",Rolpa,Kashiram Dangi
Marginal rise in blackbuck population in conservation area worries experts,"The recent blackbuck count showed a small increase in the population of blackbucks (Antilope cervicapra), locally called Krishnasar, in Khairapura-based blackbuck conservation area in Gulariya Municipality-2 raising questions about the effectiveness of conservation efforts.The blackbuck population has not increased as expected mainly due to attacks by leopards, hyenas and stray dogs, say conservationists. The fresh blackbuck count conducted during the national wildlife week, which is celebrated in the first week of the Nepali New Year, found 190 blackbucks in the conservation area. According to conservation officer Binaya Jha, there are 114 female blackbucks, 40 male blackbucks and 36 fawns.Last year’s count had put the blackbuck population at 177 in the conservation area. “There is only a slight increase in blackbuck population. The result of the count is not satisfactory. It goes to show that we have to resolve various challenges afflicting blackbuck conservation,” said Dipendra Yadav, chairman of the Blackbuck Conservation Committee.In 2014, the blackbuck population in the conservation area stood at 300. The blackbuck number has declined over the years due to various challenges. Frequent attacks by leopards and striped hyenas is the main challenge in the conservation of blackbucks. According to the conservation authority, leopards and hyenas from various forests in Tulsipur and Bechaipur visit the conservation area in search of prey and kill blackbucks.The data available at the blackbuck conservation area shows a total of 85 blackbucks were either killed or died of natural causes in the past year. Among them, 65 were killed by leopards while others were killed by hyenas, jackals, stray dogs or died due to natural causes.The monsoons also bring about a challenge in the conservation of the blackbucks in the area that has several streams passing through it. Floods in the local streams and rivers have also added to the death toll of the blackbucks. As many as 40 blackbucks were swept away by the floods in local streams in 2014 while the floods in 2018 killed 19 blackbucks.Blackbuck, which is listed as near-threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, is an antelope species native to Nepal and India. A female blackbuck generally gives birth to two fawns each year.Efforts for blackbuck conservation began in the country in 1975 when a small herd was spotted in Khairapura in Bardiya district. On March 16, 2009, the government officially declared the area as ‘Khairapura Blackbuck Conservation Area’ spreading over 708 bighas [474 hectares] of land.The presence of human settlement in the conservation area has also posed a threat to the survival of blackbucks, say conservationists. The government acquired around 350 bighas [234.5 hectares] of land in the Khairapura area for blackbuck conservation around 10 years ago. “Fifty-one families have yet to move out of the area even after receiving compensation for their land, which was acquisitioned by the government,” said Yadav.","Published at : April 22, 2022",Bardiya,Kamal Panthi
"Wildfires rage in Palpa forests, leaving human settlements at high risk","The forest fires that broke out at Dandadum Newargaun and Aryaltol in Tansen Municipality-9 a week ago are yet to be contained. A bushfire at Pospakha Community Forest in Tansen has been inching closer to human settlements in the past few days.Security personnel and local residents, with the help of a fire engine, have doused the fire near a human settlement. “But the fire is still raging in the community forest,” said Rima Somai, a local woman.A wildfire broke out in the Somadi area of Rainadebi Chhahara Rural Municipality-2 six days ago. The fire—which is raging in the forests at Tallapani, Daha and Tare hill areas of Somadi—is yet to be controlled. The villagers prevented the fire from entering the settlements but they are unable to control the fires in the forests.Forest fires are breaking out in Deurali Community Forest of Tansen-5 almost every day. According to the Division Forest Office in Palpa, fires have already damaged around 30 hectares of forestland in Deurali Community Forest this year. The forest office says that a fire often starts from solid wastes disposed near Bandebi along the Tansen-Tamghas road section and spreads to Deurali Community Forest. The security personnel of Nepal Army, Nepal Police and Armed Police Force as well as forest employees are mobilised almost every day to contain the fires in Deurali.“The forest office has sent a letter to Tansen Municipality requesting not to burn garbage in its dumping site near Bandebi until mid-May as it leads to forest fires,” said Samyog Basnet, the information officer at the Division Forest Office in Palpa.Several forests in the Chure and Mahabharat regions of Palpa are also experiencing fires. According to the Division Forest Office, forest fires are currently active at 17 places in the district. The forest office has enlisted 27 out of 81 wards of the district’s 10 local units as areas at ‘high risk’ of forest fire.Wildfire incidents recur in the district every year but the authorities concerned and the local units are not well prepared to mitigate the disaster.The Division Forest Office in Palpa, however, claims to have launched various preparedness programmes in coordination with the local units to mitigate the risk of forest fires. “A meeting regarding the control and management of forest fires was recently held. All 10 local units have been urged to broadcast or telecast fire-related information. We have been launching various awareness programmes on ways to prevent and control such fires as well,” said Dipak Gyawali, chief at the forest office. According to him, all educational institutions in the district have been instructed to raise awareness on the issue.The Division Forest Office has also formed a rapid response team under the coordination of Upendra Aryal, the chief at Ribdikot Sub-Division Forest Office, to contain forest fires immediately. The team includes representatives from the District Administration Office, Nepal Army battalion, District Police Office, Armed Police Force, Tansen Municipality, community forest users’ group Nepal and the Palpa branch of Nepal Red Cross Society.Wildfires damage hectares of forestland and affect wildlife and birds in Nepal every year. The wildfire season generally starts in November/December and continues until the onset of monsoon, which usually arrives in the country on June 10.","Published at : April 20, 2022",Palpa,Madhab Aryal
Health insurance policyholders bear the brunt of payment arrears by authority,"United Mission Hospital Tansen, a major health institution in Palpa district, issued a public notice on April 1 stating that it would charge patients an additional amount that exceeds the coverage of the health insurance board from April 4. The hospital claims that the decision was taken to keep the expense of the health institution in check in order to provide quality health services to all service seekers.The hospital administration further warned through the notice that it will close all health insurance facilities from April 19 if the unpaid due amount is not cleared by the insurance board within two weeks and health insurance coverage is adjusted on the basis of total health expenses. “The hospital is yet to receive a huge sum of money for the health expenses of the insured people despite our repeated requests. Although health service expenses at our hospital do not run very high, the gap between our health expenses and the amount provided by the health insurance board is only widening,” reads the notice issued by Dr Rachel Karakh, the director at United Mission Hospital. She claimed the hospital was under financial stress as the health insurance board failed to release the health expenses of the insured people on time. “The hospital has problems releasing monthly salaries, purchasing medicines and managing administrative expenses as the government delayed providing the amount under the health insurance expenses,” said Karakh.According to the hospital administration, the health insurance board has to pay Rs 120.7 million to the hospital for providing health services under the health insurance policy. The United Mission Hospital claimed that the hospital had to take the harsh step as the authorities concerned paid no heed to the problems it faced despite repeated requests.“The government and the health insurance board have ignored our problems time and again. We have been compelled to take the unpleasant decision that stands to affect not just the hospital but also the service seekers,” said Jiban Bhattarai, the manager at United Mission Hospital.Besides United Mission Hospital, several health institutions in Palpa providing services under the health insurance package have also complained of not receiving the due amount from the health insurance board. According to Palpa Hospital, Lumbini Medical College and Palpa Lions Lacoul Eye Hospital, the insurance board has yet to clear Rs 384.3 million since July last year.Owing to the delay in receiving health insurance expenses, Lumbini Medical College has cut off the number of patients receiving health services under the insurance policy by half in the past one and a half months. According to Krishna Prasad Parajuli, the information officer at the medical college, Lumbini Medical College used to provide health services to 500 patients on a daily basis under the health insurance policy.“The number has decreased to 250 now as the health insurance board did not provide the amount on time,” said Parajuli, adding that the medical college has not received Rs 209 million in arrears.The hospitals’ move to decline patients with insurance coverage or decrease the number of such patients by half has led to inconveniences for service seekers. Service seekers complain of having to wait for up to three days to get their turn to avail of health services under the insurance policy due to the medical institutions’ decision.Sita Karki of Tansen Municipality, who went to Lumbini Medical College for medical concerns, says she had to wait in line from midnight to get a chance to see a doctor in the morning.“If we don’t join the queue, we will not get treatment under our insurance policy,” said Karki.However, it’s not only the service seekers who are facing hardships due to non-payment from the insurance board; the operation of the hospitals has also become a challenge, says Parajuli, the information officer at Lumbini Medical College.“The medical college has been struggling to provide regular salaries to its staff, purchase medicines, repair medical tools and manage administrative expenses as it has not received health expenses from the board. The medical college purchases medicines and provides them to policy holders but we haven’t been able to do so since the health insurance board has not released the arrears,” said Parajuli.United Mission Hospital, Palpa Hospital, Lumbini Medical College, Rampur Hospital, Tahun Primary Health Centre, Khasauli Primary Health Centre, Palpa Lions Lacoul Eye Hospital and Kaligandaki Eye Treatment Centre provide health services under the health insurance package.Damodar Basaula, the executive director of the health insurance board, admits delays in issuing the budget under the health insurance policy but vows to release the amount by fulfilling due process. According to him, the board provided Rs 250 million to United Mission Hospital in the current fiscal year.“The payment is released only after thoroughly checking the medical bills provided by the hospitals. Some hospitals did not submit all the necessary documents and are now blaming the board for the payment delay,” said Basaula. “The health institutions do not have the authority to not implement the health insurance programme launched by the government.”As many as 215,000 people in Palpa are covered by health insurance. Some local units in the district have insured the Dalit and impoverished families as well. The federal government launched the health insurance plan in 2016-17. Under this plan, a family of up to five members must pay a premium of Rs 3,500 annually to avail of health services up to Rs 100,000. A family comprising more than five members must pay Rs 700 for each additional member.","Published at : April 10, 2022",Palpa,Madhab Aryal
Conservationists urge residents to help in red panda protection,"Conservationists working towards the preservation of red panda, known as Habre in Nepali, have sought the support of local residents in the eastern and northern hills of Rolpa to protect the endangered animal species. Stakeholders demand the government to do more to conserve the endangered animals and protect them from poachers and smugglers.At a recent programme on Red Panda Conservation in Libang, Chairman of Sunchahari Rural Municipality-1 Mahavir Rana Magar said there has been an increase in smuggler activities in the region and urged local residents to be involved in protecting red pandas. “Three men from Rolpa were arrested with five red panda hides from Bhaluwang Bazaar of Dang on February 25,” said Magar. “The smugglers have been killing red pandas and selling their hides so we seek the locals’ involvement in helping us in the conservation efforts.” “The locals can help in the conservation efforts by planting Himalayan bamboo, the staple food of red pandas, and maintaining natural water sources in the forest,” said Magar. “They can also inform the authorities if they come across suspicious activities of smugglers and poachers.” According to Chief District Officer Nawaraj Sapkota, smugglers have been arrested with red panda hides in Dang, Nepalgunj and other market areas in recent times. “All these red pandas were killed or stolen from Rolpa,” he said. To raise awareness about the important role locals can play to alert authorities of illegal activities concerning red pandas, the Red Panda Conservation Programme is being implemented at five local units in the upper region of the district in coordination with the local government. The programme has been underway since the past year in Rolpa Municipality, Thabang Municipality, Sunchahari Municipality, Gangadev Municipality and Parivartan Rural Municipalities. The Red Panda Conservation Project is also being implemented in Dolpa, Rukum East and Rukum West with the support of Red Panda Network and other organisations.Navin KC, coordinator of the project in Rolpa, said a search is being carried out to discover the habitat of red pandas in the district.“We plan to conserve the red pandas by raising public awareness and involving the local community,” he said. Man Bahadur Budha, 61, and his wife Lahari Budha, 52, of Sunchahari Rural Municipality found a pair of red pandas while they were collecting firewood in a nearby forest three years ago. The red pandas weighed 2kg each. The pair of red pandas are currently at the central zoo at Jawalakhel in Kathmandu. “But these days, no red pandas are seen in the area,” said Chairman of Sunchahari Rural Municipality Aash Bahadur Pun. Red pandas live in temperate forests with an abundance of bamboo in Nepal, India, Bhutan, northern Myanmar and southwestern China. They are categorised as a protected species of Nepal by the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act, 1973, The estimated number of red pandas is less than 10,000 in the world, with around 1,000 of them found in Nepal.","Published at : March 27, 2022",Rolpa,Kashiram Dangi
Eighteen-year-old twin sisters take on the cricket field,"As one enters the door of Bajgai home, an extensive wooden wall decor captivates the eyes of the beholder. But it isn’t the flat TV screen or the local architectural design of the wall decor that grabs the attention. It is the golden hue of the wall that weaves a story through the certificates and medals that captivate.Cricket. Champions. Tournaments. Best. Batswoman. Bowler. A quick skim through the awards and one can see these words come to life as the award recipients – Swastika Bajgai and Sushmita Bajgai – share their cricket journey. Born eighty-five minutes apart in Bheri Hospital, the twin sisters are cricket players. Their cricket journey began in a 7-foot alley right beside their house. In the sweltering heat of the Tarai, they began playing cricket as seven-year-olds with their elder cousins every evening.Recalling the days when they first befriended the cricket ball, Sushmita says that they were always the fielders since no one wanted to run around catching the ball. “They would only allow us to field. If we ever got to hold the bat – wooooaahhh – that would be such a huge thing for us!” says Sushmita, the elder twin.Gradually as they made their way to the bat and ball, echoes of their skills made rounds among their friends and school administrators. Within the culture of prioritising sports as an integral part of education in Nepalgunj, the entire system – including their parents, neighbours, friends and school administrations – collectively supported and encouraged the Bajgai sisters. “Schools in Nepalgunj prioritise cricket. We don’t just focus on bookish education here, and that creates an environment where we can pursue our interests and get the mentorship we need,” shares Swastika, the younger twin. Their official cricket journey began in grade nine, when they were recruited to represent Nepalgunj Model Academy, a secondary school where they appeared for their SEE examinations, in a local-level tournament.The tournament they debuted for was the Deputy Mayor Cup Inter-School Girls Cricket Tournament 2018/19, where they played against other schools and colleges and led their team to victory.“We became the first champions of our school! It was our first match and we won; that was so exciting,” excitedly the sisters share in unison. Sushmita was awarded the ‘Best Batswoman’ award in the Deputy Mayor Cup. Pointing towards a laminated rectangular frame that reads ‘Best Batswoman’ in bold letters on a golden background, Sushmita says, “I think out of all the awards that I have received thus far, I am very happy about that award. I would call it my biggest achievement.”Their first victory became a tale of other victories to follow. A year later, in grade ten, they led their school to another win in the Hissan Cup in 2019/20. Post their SEE examinations, their remarkable sportsmanship was acknowledged and further encouraged by various colleges in Nepalgunj. The sisters were offered sports scholarships, promising them further athletic training and opportunities to participate in tournaments. A year on, the Bajgai sisters took part in the Deputy Mayor Cup Inter-School Girls Cricket Tournament 2020/21 representing Holyland College and claimed the title of the champions, again. Until then, the eighteen-year-old duo had always claimed their victories together – at both school and district level matches – ever since they began playing. However, an accident on the field caused their paths to be separated and pushed them to take on their journeys individually.A year ago, during practice sessions, as Sushmita leapt forward to catch the ball during fielding, she fractured her little finger. This accident took place right before the selection matches for the Prime Minister Cup 2020/21, because of which she had to forgo the opportunity.From then on, Sushmita and Swastika had to take on their individual cricket journeys. Swastika gave her best performance in the selection process in the PM Cup, paving her path as a province-level cricket player at the age of seventeen. “The performance I gave in the PM Cup selection is perhaps my best one. I took five wickets from Dang, the opponent team, and that five-wicket haul is what I think made the selectors pick me for the tournament,” says Swastika. Sushmita cheered on for her twin sister who represented Lumbini Province and made it to Kathmandu to compete in the PM Cup. The twins are each others’ pillars, supporting one another through thick and thin. In the absence of the other, they didn’t enjoy their matches as much but ensured that they motivated one another, though virtually.“We would always be on call and share what happened the entire day during our training if we were apart. We always talk about our gaming strategies and how we can perform better,” says Sushmita. “And that’s such a relief because we can rely on one another completely.”The Bajgai twins, who are one another’s biggest confidantes, however, aren’t always the most compatible sisters. They laugh and share an instance when Sushmita had to consult a doctor after Swastika hit her. “We were a little young back then. We were just sitting on the sofa and our younger brother asked me to get something, and I asked Sushmita to get it instead. We had a little argument back and forth, and suddenly hands were involved,” shares Swastika as she peeks at Sushmita and gives a sly smile. A playful banter among the sisters became serious when Sushmita fell sick with fever after the incident and had a bruise on the bone of her neck. Despite such occasional quarrels – some verbal, some physical – the twin sisters come together in their aspirations with cricket. While age restrictions kept them from taking part in the Under-19 National Cricket Tournament, they aren’t deterred from pursuing further opportunities in the future.Regardless, the humility and enthusiasm of the Bajgai sisters are an inspiration as they now actively share their skills with girls younger than them who are currently undergoing training for the U-19 cricket team. Sushmita and Swastika carried the winning streak with them, but their victories aren’t solely theirs. Their victory belongs to their family, friends, coaches, school and college administrations and the Banke Cricket Association. The support and encouragement they received from their school administration were crucial to their journey in cricket. Swastika says, “Our principal Bigyan Shah at Nepalgunj Model Academy wouldn’t care as much if it was boys’ matches, but he always made sure that he was present in the girls’ matches.” To encourage young girls’ involvement in cricket, Shah also recruited a cricket coach for the school. The Bajgai sisters speak very highly of their coach Irfan Hussein who contributed significantly to their cricket journey. Additionally, they also acknowledge the role that Banke Cricket Association has played in their exposure and access to opportunities in cricket. “If the Banke Cricket Association doesn’t create tournaments, we won’t have places to demonstrate and sharpen our skills. If there were no opportunities for us to compete, we wouldn’t have been encouraged to play,” says Sushmita who is a district-level cricket player representing Banke district. They also share that the association has been crucial for aspiring female players with financial difficulties as they are provided with material support – kits – to play. “They support girls, and they understand our hardships. Many girls can’t afford to buy kits – such as helmets, batting gloves, batting leg pads – and the association allows them to borrow kits,” elaborates Swastika. “They uplift girls who can’t take part in games due to financial limitations.”Amidst all the substructures provided by their society, the Bajgai sisters are extremely grateful to their parents for the foundation they have built for the girls. “Daddy supports us a lot. As a sports enthusiast himself, he tries his best to reach every single location of our tournament – be it in Nepalgunj, Dhangadhi or Dang,” says Swastika, a province-level cricket player representing Lumbini Province. “During the lockdown, Daddy trained us in the empty plot behind us and Mummy would look at us from the terrace and cheer us on.”“Daddy supports us physically and Mummy supports us emotionally,” added Sushmita.However, they also share their mother’s worry for a future they seek in cricket. There are times when their mother gets frustrated with them and says, “yo dallo falera k huncha” (what’s going to happen if you throw this spherical mass), implying that there’s no future in the game.Given the low pay and wanting opportunities, their mother sometimes wishes they didn’t seek a journey that doesn’t guarantee a stable and secure lifestyle. Regardless, the Bajgai sisters humbly acknowledge that they have been privileged to have such understanding parents who support their dreams. “We have seen our friends’ parents who are so hesitant to let their children go anywhere outside Nepalgunj and play. When we see the restrictions they face, we realise how fortunate we are,” says Sushmita.The sisters hold ambitions as high as to enrol in Nepal Army as a second lieutenant after their grade twelve examinations. They aspire to be on the national team and represent Nepal internationally. In this adrenaline-filled journey of theirs, they wish their friends could join them. They wish other young girls received the supportive environment they received in pursuing their aspirations.“We wish all parents actually tried to understand their children’s desires,” says Sushmita. “Maybe then we would have many young girls as cricket players.”","Published at : March 27, 2022",Nepalgunj,Aakriti Ghimire
"Archaeologists begin excavation, exploration of historic Chetradeikot","A team of archaeologists has begun excavation and exploration works at Chetradeikot in Buddhabhoomi Municipality-10, Kapilvastu this week.The archaeologists from the Department of Archaeology, the Lumbini Development Trust and Durham University in the UK have commenced the excavation work at Chetradeikot, a historically and archaeologically important fort, by using modern technological tools. Trenches have been dug in three different places on the premises of the fort as per a geophysical survey conducted in the area in 2020. The geophysical survey had revealed the existence of walls and ruins of temples or buildings.Chetradeikot lies around one kilometre west of Tilaurakot, an ancient Shakya capital city where Siddhartha Gautam spent his princely life before he became the Buddha. It spreads in five bighas of land which is under the Department of Archaeology.A 5m long and 1.5m wide trench has been dug at the premises of Chetradeikot for exploration. According to Himal Uprety, chief archaeological officer at the Lumbini Development Trust, Indian archaeologist PC Mukherjee had unearthed the same place in 1899 and recovered walls dating back to the 7th Century. “The place where Mukherjee excavated is also included in the project,” said Uprety. According to him, various goods like coals, bricks, metals and soil recovered during the excavation have been collected for carbon dating. It is expected that the fresh excavation will be helpful in determining the time period and structures of ancient Chetradeikot. “Chetradeikot is near the Shakya capital Tilaurakot. It can be a temple of the Shakya dynasty,” said senior archaeologist Basanta Bidari. According to him, Mukherjee’s report states that the ruins of two temples and three wells were recovered from Chetradeikot during his excavation in 1899.“Several historic pieces of evidence have been recovered while excavating Tilaurakot and its surrounding areas. Evidence is being collected from Chetradeikot as well that confirms its link with the historic Tilaurakot. The excavation and exploration work of Chetradeikot will be helpful to enlist Tilaurakot in UNESCO's world heritage list,” said archaeologist Ram Bahadur Kunwar, who is also the planning unit chief at the Department of Archaeology.The Department of Archaeology and Lumbini Development Trust started excavating and exploring Tilaurakot and its surrounding areas in 2012.The archaeologists believe that the excavation and exploration at Chetradeikot will be helpful for the conservation and management of places related to Budhha. According to Kunwar, the goods recovered during the fresh excavation at Chetradeikot will be properly studied. A team of 28 people, including six archaeologists and students of Durham University, four archaeologists of the Department of Archaeology, two archaeologists from the Lumbini Development Trust, one Nepali consultant and students of Lumbini Buddhist University, is involved in the month-long excavation work.","Published at : March 26, 2022",Kapilvastu,Manoj Paudel
Palpa’s Amar Narayan Temple in disrepair,"The roof of Amar Narayan Temple at Narayansthan in Tansen Municipality-2, Palpa collapsed last Wednesday. The three-storied temple had undergone repair works only four years ago.“The extended roof of the first floor on the south and east side of the pagoda-styled temple collapsed with a loud noise,” said Uma Shankar Pokharel, the priest of the temple. The Amar Narayan Temple was built by Kaji Amar Singh Thapa about two centuries ago during the Nepal-British War in 1806. Thapa had brought craftsmen from Kathmandu to build the temple.“The Amar Narayan Temple was renovated by the Department of Archeology from 2015 to 2018 under the supervision of Tansen Municipality. During the renovation, the uppermost roof was covered in brass and the Gajur in gold. The old worn out woods were replaced while the damaged ones were repaired,” said Pokhrel.According to locals, the temple, which survived the earthquake of 1934, has wooden carvings of archaeological significance. Since the collapse of a part of the structure on Wednesday, the temple has been closed to the public. “The western and northern side of the temple are also at risk of collapsing. We can’t allow the public to enter the temple premises since it is risky,” said Pokharel.Chief District Officer Jagannath Pant and Tansen Mayor Ashok Kumar Shahi visited the temple to inspect the damage. The Department of Archaeology was also informed about the collapse and two engineers from Kapilvastu, Lumbini carried out the survey on Thursday morning.According to Bishnu Pathak, an engineer at the Department of Archeology, the records of the wreckage have been kept in a safe place. “The temple contains valuable wooden materials and ancient carvings,” he said. Meanwhile, the locals allege that the temple’s roof collapsed as the repair work done four years ago was not up to the standards. “A complaint has been lodged with the concerned authority against the construction company for carrying out substandard work,” said Varun Regmi, ward chairman of Tansen Municipality-2.“At the time of the reconstruction, the locals had complained to the stakeholders about the poor quality of work being done by the contractor,” said Narayan Prasad Koirala, chairman of the temple management committee. “The municipality, Department of Archeology, and the consultant engineer had ignored us back then. There was sheer negligence and ignorance on the part of the authorities.”Maheshwar Shrestha, a local resident, said, “The temple has historical and archaeological significance and it is important to take the local people’s input but the concerned authorities did not listen to us.”The renovation work of the temple was done at a cost of Rs.30 million with loan assistance from the World Bank. The maintenance work was contracted to Prakritik Construction Private Limited, Rupandehi.","Published at : March 18, 2022",Palpa,Madhav Aryal
Bardiya park sees increase in tourist numbers,"Naresh Shrestha of Tripureshwor in Kathmandu visited Bardiya National Park last week with his friends for a tiger watching safari. His happiness knew no bounds when he spotted a tiger in the park on the second day of his visit. Gyanendra Joshi from Doti too visited Bardiya that week to watch tigers. “I saw a female tiger with her cubs at the Baghaura Phant area and a male tiger at Balkune. I am elated,” said Joshi.Like Shrestha and Joshi, many nature lovers—both domestic and foreign—are thronging to Bardiya National Park, a major tiger habitat in the country, in hopes of seeing the big cat. According to conservationists and nature guides, tigers are generally spotted in the national park’s forest during the onset of summer.Bardiya National Park is seeing an increase in tourist numbers as it is a high season for jungle safaris and the country is witnessing a decline in Covid-19 cases, according to tourism entrepreneurs.“Tourists visiting the national park return home happily as most of them have been able to spot tigers in the park forests in the past 10 days,” said Ramji Babu Thapa, a tourism entrepreneur in Bardiya.According to Anuram Chaudhary, a nature guide, with the rise in temperature in the Tarai region, tigers frequently come to the stream in the Tinkune area to quench their thirst. “Around 80 percent of all visitors have been able to see tigers during jeep safaris in the past week or so,” Chaudhary said. He added that tigers are often spotted at Tinkune, Geruwa, Kingfisher, Bagudaphanta, Babai Valley and Chure areas of the national park and in the Khata biological corridor just outside the park.As per the tiger census 2018, the country has a total 235 tigers. The Bardiya National Park, covering an area of 968 square kilometres, is home to 87 endangered Royal Bengal tigers. Bardiya National Park and India’s Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve jointly won this year’s TX2 Award for doubling their tiger populations since 2010.Bardiya National Park, which remained closed for months due to the Covid-19 pandemic, reopened to visitors on October 18, 2021. “Domestic tourists from across the country are visiting the national park to see tigers. The number of foreign tourists is also on the rise,” said Ram Bahadur Shahi, a tourism entrepreneur.The increase in tourist flow comes as a relief to local tourism entrepreneurs and business operators, who had to close their businesses for months due to the pandemic.“Nature lovers, mainly from Kathmandu, Pokhara, Butwal, Dang and Dhangadhi, among other places, have booked rooms in our resort. They prefer to visit Bardiya as they can easily see tigers here,” said Dharmaraj Ghimire, a resort owner in the park area.According to the national park administration, around 16,000 tourists—both domestic and foreign—visited the Bardiya National Park in the last fiscal year of 2020/21. More than 10,000 people visited the park by February in the current fiscal year.","Published at : March 13, 2022",Bardiya,Kamal Panthi
Noise pollution affecting children in Palpa schools,"On Monday, Sal Bahadur Saru-Magar, a grade eight student in Janapriya Secondary School in Jyamire of Nisdi Rural Municipality-7 in Palpa, was trying his best to concentrate on his lessons. But a long queue of trucks carrying limestones had formed on the road outside his classroom distracting him with loud horns.Saru-Magar says the commotion outside his classroom is a daily occurrence and it is hard to be able to focus on his lessons. “I haven’t been able to concentrate in the classroom,” he said. “This has affected my performance in school.” It has been four years since the school authorities have been complaining about the noise pollution caused by heavy traffic outside the school but their voices have gone unheard, says Yama Bahadur Ale, assistant principal of Janapriya Secondary School.“Hundreds of trucks carrying limestones pass by this road every day. The noise caused by heavy traffic along this road is deafening,” said Ale. “We have repeatedly requested the ward office and the District Administration Office to look into our problems but nothing has been done yet,” he said. The Palpa-Nawalpur road stretch outside Janpriya Secondary School passes through Pragati Basic School in Chhetri Kharka and Serodevi Primary School in Mathekhark. The students of these two schools have also been facing the same issues. The school buildings of Janpriye Secondary School and Serodevi Secondary School are 50 metres from the road while four classrooms of Pragati Basic School abut the road. Approximately the Palpa-Nawalpur road stretch is used by 2,000 tippers, according to the data of Nisdi Rural Municipality.The constant movement of heavy vehicles close to the school premises has not only resulted in noise pollution but has also made students’ commute to and from the schools risky. Gunisara BK from Jyamire, whose ward attends Janpriye Secondary School, says his child’s safety worries him every day. “The truck drivers do not abide by the speed limit in school areas. They drive recklessly and I’m constantly worried about my child’s safety,” said BK.“Our children have started refusing to go to school because the environment is not conducive for a healthy learning experience. At first, we all thought that the mining industry would be good for the area economically but its mismanagement puts our children’s lives at risk every day.” According to Krishna Bahadur Rana, a local of Rollagah village—a four-hour walk from Jyamire—he is compelled to send his children to Janapriya Secondary School since it is the only secondary school in the area.“We have no choice but to send our children to the school in Jyamire because that is the closest one to our village,” said Rana. “But now I am scared to send my wards to school because it’s risky. The mining industry only brought trouble to the area. The noise and dust pollution in the school area, coupled with the risk of being run over by speeding vehicles, is discouraging for parents and students alike,” he said. The dust pollution in the area has also added to the expenses of parents while sending their children to school. “My children now need several sets of clothes to stay clean and dust-free and not all families can afford to buy them new clothes every other day,” he said.Hem Bahadur Thapa, principal of Pragati Basic School, says the guardians of students at his school are constantly in a state of panic concerned about the safety of their children when in school.“Parents themselves have difficulty manoeuvring their way to the school through this road section. Most parents come to drop off their children at school but several children make their way home on their own after school. The parents worry and some choose to not send their children to school,” said Thapa. “There has been an uptick in absenteeism of late.” According to Thapa, crossing the road to get to school is risky for children with the constant movement of heavy vehicles. “The operation of heavy vehicles on this road stretch has affected the overall output of the students and teachers alike,” he said. “It’s getting difficult to run the school. This is a very stressful environment for students and they can’t be expected to do well academically.”The road is steep in the section where it passes Serodevi Primary School, resulting in a higher decibel noise in the area, says Santosh Bhattarai, principal of Serodevi Primary School. “Heavy vehicles are loud when in operation in steep areas and since the drivers don’t follow the restriction signs and use horns unnecessarily, the noise becomes unbearable,” said Bhattarai. Cement factories, mine operators, transporters and locals have discussed the issue several times to reduce the speed of the tippers near the school areas but despite many discussions, the problem has not been resolved yet, said Gagan Singh Soti, ward chairman of Nisdi Rural Municipality-7.“Road accidents are bound to occur if this continues but no matter how many times we complain to the concerned bodies, no steps have been taken to control the movement of heavy vehicles in school areas,” said Soti.Niraj Neupane, a teacher at Janapriya Secondary School, says the noise and environmental pollution caused by the unabated movement of heavy vehicles in school areas has led to anxiety and respiratory issues in children.“The students don’t feel safe when they come to school and become highly anxious. The dusty road and the fumes from the vehicles are the leading cause of children falling ill with respiratory problems,” said Neupane. Dr Baburam Marasini, a retired director of Epidemiology and Disease Control Division under the Department of Health Services, says noise pollution can cause various health issues, especially in children.“Sudden loud noises can affect children’s ability to concentrate. Air pollution, especially dust and smoke from vehicles, can trigger long-term respiratory diseases, eye problems and heart diseases,” Marasini told the Post. “Children should be kept away from loud persistent noises because the repercussions on health could be lasting.”There are about 10 limestone mining industries in Rainadevi Chahara, Mathagadhi, Tinau, Nisdi and Rainadevi Chhahra rural municipalities in Palpa. The district is known to host the country’s largest limestone mine. Limestone is being extracted in different places of Palpa by Satyawati Cement, BS Cement, Hongshi Shivam Cement, Palpa Cement, Siddhartha Minerals, Kanchan Quarries, Sarbottam Cement and Alpha Cement.The limestones are transported from the mining industry in the Mahabharat region to the cement industries in Rupandehi, Nawalparasi and Kapilvastu.  Aakash Chaudhary contributed reporting.","Published at : March 12, 2022",Palpa,Madhab Aryal
Child marriage still rampant in Rolpa,"Child marriage is still rampant in several villages of Rolpa, a hill district of Lumbini Province.Recent data reveals that as many as 31 underage couples tied the knot in a dozen settlements at Rolpa Municipality Ward No 2 alone in the past two years. Last week, the women and mothers groups of different villages of the ward organised an interaction programme to discuss the issue of child marriage. They informed the people’s representatives about the situation of child marriage in the ward and urged them to take necessary initiatives to control the practice. “I was shocked upon knowing the situation of child marriage in the ward. Neither the ward office nor the municipal office was aware of the high prevalence of child marriage,” said Khati Gharti Magar, a ward member of Rolpa-2. According to child rights activists and local women’s groups, child marriage goes unchecked in several settlements, including Khabang, Thalabang, Sibang, Khangbang, Kavrekharka, Pachhabang, Dhanmuda, Upallo Gaun, Tallo Gaun and Thalibang, in Rolpa Municipality-2.The civil code 2017 states that the minimum age for marriage for both women and men in Nepal is 20. Though the country abolished child marriage in 1963, the social practice is still rampant in rural areas despite various attempts of the government authorities and social organisations to end the practice.“Most of the teenagers in such underage marriages elope if their guardians, with the support of social organisations, attempt to stop them from marrying. Despite various efforts from the government authorities, local women’s groups and social organisations, child marriage is still rampant in the muncipalty,” said Prajita Gharti Magar, a woman leader of Rolpa Municipality.According to Gokarna Pun, an assistant professor at Jaljala Multiple Campus and a researcher on child marriage, around 30 percent of the total marriages in Rolpa Municipality is of underage couples while the figure of child marriage in the entire district of Rolpa is around 39 percent. Gender discrimination, lack of opportunity for education and job, dowry system, lack of awareness among the guardians, lack of effective implementation of laws and ineffective monitoring by the concerned authorities, among others, are the main reasons behind the high number of child marriage cases in the district. “All three levels of the government and social organisations should work hand in hand to come up with effective plans and policies to end child marriage,” Pun said.Keeping in view the high rate of child marriage, Rolpa Municipality in the fiscal year 2017-18 prepared a five-year plan to end the practice. The local unit also formulated working guidelines but the plan has yet to be implemented effectively. “The plan could not be implemented as expected due to a lack of budget and awareness among the people,” said Man Kumari Gharti Magar, the deputy mayor of Rolpa Municipality. The municipality had planned to reduce the rate of child marriage to five percent by 2022.As per the record of the District Police Office in Rolpa, the police stopped the marriages of 43 underage couples in the last fiscal year. “We have been launching awareness campaigns against child marriage along with taking legal action against those involved in such practice,” said Deputy Superintendent of Police Binod Ghimire.","Published at : March 6, 2022",Rolpa,Kashiram Dangi
Unplanned infrastructure development in Gulmi takes toll on environment,"Unplanned development activities and road connectivity projects initiated by the local governments in Gulmi, a hill district of Lumbini Province, have led to environmental degradation.After the local level elections in 2017, all 12 local units in Gulmi prioritised road construction in their annual budgets. Thousands of trees were cut down to build roads using heavy machinery. According to the data available at the local units, a total of 28,518 trees were felled while constructing roads in the district in the past five years. Most of the rural roads funded by the local government were constructed without conducting environmental impact assessments. Deforestation for road projects has resulted in landslides and the drying up of natural sources of water in the district. Resunga Municipality, where the district headquarters of Gulmi is located, constructed several road stretches including Tamghas-Palalmi, Tamghas-Resunga, Garjura-Bhadgaun, Pandehelpokhara-Banjhapokhari and a ring road around the municipality in the past five years. Correspondingly, the water sources in the area have been drying up at a fast pace in the last couple of years. According to the municipal office, the natural water sources at Kholtepani, Pandherathari, Chhaharakhola, Rolkhola, Changkhola, Balkate, Upallopani and Attarkanda, among other places, have dried up in recent years due to haphazard road construction and excessive use of heavy machinery in the fragile topography. “Residents of Bhadgaun settlement at Resunga-3 and Attarkanda and Balkate settlements are reeling under acute shortage of drinking water as all water sources have dried up due to the unplanned road construction projects. The villagers, especially women, are hardest hit by the water crisis,” said Laxmi Kunwar of Resunga-3. Women are traditionally responsible for managing water for the household in rural areas. “The women in the affected villages have to walk for miles to fetch water after natural water springs in their settlement dried up. They are also struggling to collect firewood and fodder due to rampant deforestation in the area,” said Batukrishna Uprety, an advocate specialising in environmental law. “The government has failed to implement laws effectively to conserve the environment.” As per the data made available to the Post, around 200 natural water sources dried up in the district in the past few years.Padam Prasad Aryal, the spokesperson of Resunga Municipality, admitted that the municipality cut down thousands of trees while constructing around a dozen roads without carrying out an environmental impact assessment. A recent study by the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development and Nepal Water Conservation Foundation shows that natural water sources are drying up and shifting in various places of Nepal due to the unplanned construction of roads and buildings. While studying the water sources in 300 local units of hill and mountain regions of Nepal, the study found that water sources dried up in around 74 percent of local bodies and water sources shifted to other places in around 58 percent of the local units.The use of dozers and excavators while constructing roads has also led to frequent landslides in the district. The haphazard dumping of soil and stones during road construction has further exposed the settlements to flooding and landslides.According to the District Police Office in Gulmi, a total of 2,968 landslides occurred, mainly due to haphazard road construction, across the district in the past four years, destroying 247 houses and 165 animal sheds. As many as 36 people and 210 domesticated animals were killed by landslides during the same time period.The landslides have also swept away hectares of cultivable land in the district. Around 20 ropanis of land belonging to seven households at Bhadgaun in Resunga-3 were buried as rainwater swept away soil and stones dumped while constructing roads in the area. “We used to grow paddy, wheat, maize and other legumes and rear animals in our four ropanis of land. Now we have to work in other people’s fields after the mudslides buried our land,” said Krishna Kumari Kunwar of Resunga-3.As many as 9,249 trees were cut down while constructing roads in Dhurkot Rural Municipality in the past five years. The rural municipal office, however, claims that it tried its best to minimise environmental degradation while constructing roads and other development infrastructure in the local unit. “Roads are an important infrastructure of development. It is essential for the economic development of rural areas and transportation of local products to the markets. That is why we have prioritised road construction projects,” said Bhupal Pokharel, the chairman of the municipality. “The municipality has focused on minimising the impact of development projects on the environment and controlling soil erosion while constructing roads.”","Published at : March 6, 2022",Gulmi,Gaganshila Khadka
"With more tigers, attacks are also up","Wakil Gaddi, a resident of Raptisonari Rural Municipality-7 in Banke district, survived an attack by a tiger a few days ago. The critically injured Gaddi, who is in his early thirties, is recuperating at Bheri Hospital, Nepalgunj.“The tiger pounced and caught me by my neck. It pierced my nape with its teeth. I did not struggle instead lied prostrate pretending to be dead,” said the traumatised Gaddi. “I could feel the tiger sucking my blood. Soon I could hear some people shouting and trying to chase the tiger away. The big cat left me and went into the forest. And I ran to save my life.”The big cat attacked Gaddi on February 20 when he had gone to the local forest to collect Babiyo (Eulaliopsis binata) to make ropes. The deep wounds in his neck are yet to heal and he needs support to get up from the bed. “I did not think I would survive when the tiger attacked me. I feel very lucky,” he said. A day before the attack on Gaddi, Dhan Bahadur Chalaune was also attacked by a tiger in a similar fashion at Phattepur in Raptisonari-7. Chalaune did not survive the attack. The tiger emerging from the Banke National Park had mauled the eldest among 23 people who had gone to collect fodder and firewood to the community forest. Chalaune was 60.The incidents of tigers entering the community forests near human settlements are on the rise lately. As many as five people were killed in separate attacks by tigers in Banke district in the past seven months. Several injuries have been reported along with loss of domesticated animals.The situation is exactly the same in the neighbouring Bardiya district as well. Five people were killed by tigers in the current fiscal year. Twelve people lost their lives in the last fiscal year.According to conservationists, almost all the incidents of tiger attacks happened either on busy roads that pass through the national park forests or near the human settlements. They suspect that the tigers are entering the settlements due to changes in their genetic behaviour.“The tigers find domestic animals brought to forest areas to graze to be easy prey. And humans who go into forests for fodder and firewood are also easy to kill. Tigers may have been entering the area near the settlements for easy prey,” said Shyam Kumar Shah, the chief conservation officer at the Banke National Park. There are several human settlements in the buffer zone area of the Banke and Bardiya national parks. The tigers have easy access to domestic animals and people in the areas. The tigers generally prefer to live in isolated forests far from human crowds and hunt prey by chasing them. “But of late, tigers have been entering human settlements to prey on the grazing animals. The tigers are getting used to preying on domestic animals since they are easy targets,” said Shah, who closely observes tiger behaviour in the national park areas.The other reason for an increase in tiger attacks on people and domestic animals in recent years could be infighting between male tigers, according to conservationists. The male tigers often fight territorial battles and the defeated ones roam around in search of a new habitat. While the tiger population is showing an uptick, their habitat is shrinking. The number of tigers in the abutting Banke and Bardiya national parks is estimated to be 108. “The habitats have been shrinking with the increasing population of tigers. Many male tigers do not stay in the same area. Enraged at the territorial battle, the tigers leave their old habitat and move around in search of new places,” said Bishnu Prasad Shrestha, the chief conservation officer at the Bardiya National Park. According to conservationists, tigers attack people when the latter disturb them during mating. Tigresses sometimes enter community forests near human settlements to protect their cubs from the attack by the males. Hunger could lead to these tigresses preying on human beings and domestic animals. The old, diseased and injured tigers also often enter the settlements and attack human beings and prey on domesticated animals.Tigers are generally fond of preying on various deer species like spotted deer, barking deer and sambar deer. They move towards the forests near human settlements to prey on the domesticated animals if they do not find deer in their habitats.Conservationists say tigers roam around 40 to 50 square kilometres in their habitat with the availability of enough prey animals. If there is a shortage of prey animals, they move around 100 square kilometres. “Lack of enough prey animals in the forests can be another cause behind the tigers entering human settlements in search of food,” said Shrestha.","Published at : March 2, 2022",Nepalgunj,J Pandey
Limestone extraction drying up water sources in Lumbini,"Most hill districts of Lumbini Province are gradually losing natural springs due to the haphazard extraction of limestone. While the local residents have been hugely affected by the drying up of natural water sources in the catchment area, the authorities remain indifferent to the environmental impacts caused by limestone exploitation in Palpa, Arghakhanchi, Rolpa and Pyuthan districts.Residue substances from the excavation sites are carried downhill during the rainy season, blocking, burying and destroying natural springs and damaging drinking water supply lines snaking through the hillsides. The haphazard mining has directly affected the settlements below the limestone mines, exposing them to the risk of landslides and floods during the rainy season.Kim Bahadur Ale Magar, a resident of Mathekharka settlement in Nisdi Rural Municipality-7, Palpa, says 34 households in his settlement are at risk of being buried by landslides. “The haphazard mining of limestones in the area has put us all at risk of landslides and floods during the rainy season,” said Magar. “There is no respite for us during the dry season too as residue substances from the mining site have damaged our water supply lines.” Hongshi Shivam Cement has been extracting limestone from a quarry at Jyamire, which is just above Mathekharka settlement. “Water supplied by the drinking water project gets murky if it rains in the area. We have been facing drinking water problems ever since the limestone mine came into operation a few years ago,” said Magar. Limestone is being extracted in 10 different places of Palpa by Satyawati Cement, BS Cement, Hongshi Shivam Cement, Palpa Cement, Siddhartha Minerals, Kanchan Quarries, Sarbottam Cement and Alpha Cement.Residents of Shreedanda in Tinau Rural Municipality-3 have also been living with the repercussions of haphazard mining in the area. The limestone mine above the settlement has caused damages to the drinking water project and irrigation canal.“The residue from mining over the years has damaged the drinking water project. The water we get is undrinkable. The concerned authorities and stakeholders remain indifferent to the problem,” said Bishnumaya Somai of Shreedanda.According to the local people, drinking water sources have dried up at Adhamara while the reservoir, pipeline and intake in Jyamire have been damaged by the mine residue substances. In Siddheshwar of Rainadevi Chhahara-1, a drinking water project has been left incomplete mainly due to the limestone mining by Sarbottam Cement. The construction work of Marshyangdi-Chisapani Drinking Water Project was initiated in the fiscal year 2015-16 at the cost of Rs 49.8 million. The project aimed to supply drinking water to 462 households in the area. “But the drinking water project has been left in limbo as an intake tank had to be shifted to another place and the alignment of the pipeline had to be changed due to the limestone mine,” said Gyan Bahadur BK, the chairman of the drinking water project.Sarbottam Cement has been excavating limestone from just above the water source of the drinking water project for the past four years. “The drinking water project has been affected due to the mining. The limestone mining has left the pipeline at risk, forcing us to change the pipeline alignment,” said Romakanta Neupane, a technician at the Water Supply and Sanitation Division Office in Palpa.The Marshyangdi-Chisapani Drinking Water Project was supposed to be completed within two years of its initiation. But the project is still incomplete even after six years of its commencement due to the limestone mine. The residents of Tallo Asarre, Mathillo Asare, Bhutukdi and Manabha, among other settlements in Siddeshwar, have been facing water shortage problems owing to the delay in completing the drinking water project.Similarly, water sources in Rolpa district are drying up due to the unchecked limestone mining at Goderiche in Runtigadhi Rural Municipality-6.“Water sources are gradually drying up in the area due to the rampant extraction of limestone near water sources and haphazard construction of roads. If the mining goes unchecked, people in the area will be facing a water crisis soon,” said Janak Pun of Holeri.According to Pun, several water springs were buried while constructing the access road to the limestone mine in Goderiche. Drinking water projects, irrigation projects and other infrastructures have also sustained damages due to the floods that bring limestone residues while several human settlements below the mine are at risk of floods and landslides.The local people have started protesting against the haphazard extraction of limestone, stating that the mines are drying up water sources, destroying forests and polluting the environment. The residents of Budhagaun in Tribeni Rural Municipality-4 started protesting after Rolpa Limestone Pvt Ltd got permission to extract stones in the area. They claim that the operation of the limestone mine will leave the settlements at risk of floods and landslides and degrade the environment. Similarly, the local people of Holeri formed a struggle committee to ‘save’ Murulelek from being spoiled by limestone extraction.The Federal Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies issued a license to operate mines on the recommendation of the local unit. The local people complained that the local unit did not hold discussions with them before making the recommendation.“We got to know about the operation of the mine only after the businesspersons came to the area with the license issued by the federal government. The local unit did not hold talks with the local people about the mine operation. It seems that the local unit does not take the sentiments of the local people into consideration,” said Keshav Chand of Murele in Rolpa.The residents of Arghakhanchi are also living with similar problems caused by limestone operation. Several water springs have dried up in the area after a limestone mine came into operation in Narpani hill a few years ago. “The water springs dried up two years after Arghakhanchi Cement started extracting limestones from the area. We took to the street demanding that the mine be closed,” said Padam KC of Narpani.After a series of protests from the local residents, authorities finally closed the mine at Narpani.“It’s been 10 years since the mine’s closure and water levels in the springs are slowly increasing now,” said KC.(Kashiram Dangi in Rolpa and Birendra KC in Arghakhanchi contributed reporting.)","Published at : February 20, 2022",Palpa,Madhav Aryal
Health workers concerned over high maternal mortality rate in Banke,"When Sannu Devi Yadav was taken to Laxmanpur Health Post on December 16 last year for safe delivery, she had already lost consciousness. The 20-year-old from Narainapur Rural Municipality-7 was immediately referred to Bheri Hospital in Nepalgunj, as her condition was critical. She was admitted to the Intensive Care unit of the hospital but passed away a few days later.“Yadav was suffering from anemia. We could not save both the mother and child,” said Kashiram, the victim's maternal uncle.According to Yadav's relatives, she did not visit a health institution even once for a regular test during pregnancy. Her health condition was not known as she never went to get her health checked, they say.In September last year, Sapana Ale, 22, from Surkhet too lost her life at Bheri Hospital. She fell unconscious after suffering from excessive bleeding while giving birth to a baby. A month after that, 20-year-old Sita Harijan of Janaki Rural Municipality-5 in Banke district too died of pregnancy-related complications at Bheri Hospital. Both the women had never visited a health institution for regular checkups during their pregnancies.“Many women in rural areas don’t visit health facilities during their pregnancies. This has led to a high maternal mortality rate in the district,"" said Jayanti Shrestha, a senior nursing officer at Bheri Hospital.Banke, a Tarai district in Lumbini Province, has hundreds of health institutions that provide maternity health checkups. But the maternal maternity rate is still alarmingly high in the district. According to the District Health Office in Banke, as many as 83 women in the district died of pregnancy-related complications in the last three fiscal years. Among them, 35 died in the fiscal year 2019-20, 41 in 2020-21 and seven women have died in the current fiscal year. Most of the women died as they were brought to the health institution only after their condition had worsened, health workers say.There are many pregnant women and postpartum mothers near the Nepal-India border who visit the health institutions in India and die there. The health office does not include the data of those women who die in India.The high maternal mortality rate in Banke has been a cause for concern for many health officials and workers. “All the relevant authorities should take the issue of maternal mortality seriously. The government authorities, health workers and the families of pregnant women should work hand-in-hand to address the issue,” said Shrestha. “Maternal mortality rate cannot be decreased until and unless the family members of pregnant women and postpartum mothers are aware about the importance of safe pregnancies and motherhood.” According to her, government authorities should raise awareness on the importance of safe motherhood, regular health checkups during pregnancy and timely treatment of women with critical health conditions.Health workers say that the relevant authorities did not pay much attention to safe motherhood during the first and second waves of Covid-19. “The lives of many pregnant women and postpartum mothers could have been saved if the authorities had launched an effective awareness programme during the Covid-19 pandemic. During that time, many women opted for home births fearing Covid-19 infection at the hospital and died for want of timely treatment,” said Basundhara Gyawali, a health worker at Bheri Hospital. Teenage pregnancies and a lack of regular health checkups, nutritious food and awareness among family members are the leading causes behind the high maternal mortality rate in Banke, according to health workers. Besides the high maternal mortality rate, the infant mortality rate is also high in Banke. According to the District Health Office, 111 infants died in the fiscal year 2020-21 while the figure was 197 in the fiscal year 2019-20.","Published at : February 14, 2022",Nepalgunj,Rupa Gahatraj
Five dead in a fire in Tulsipur,"Five people died after a four-storey building caught fire at Tulsi Boarding Chok in Tulsipur Sub-Metropolitan City on Friday. According to the police, five people from two families living in the building died when it caught fire. Two brothers, aged 14 and 16, and their 40-year-old neighbour Nazaruddin Ali and his two children—a five-year-old son and 13-year-old daughter— lost their lives in the incident.According to family members, the 16-year-old boy, son of Hussain Baksh, rescued his mother and sister from the fourth floor of the building where the family was sleeping. He went back to the living quarters to rescue his younger brother. Both of them were found dead by the police at 7am. Their father, Hussain Baksh, who was in Surkhet at the time of the incident, ran a footwear shop and a warehouse in the four-storey rented building. According to police, an electrical short circuit on the ground floor of the building ignited the fire.The second floor of the building was used as a warehouse for footwear while the two top floors were used for residential purposes. Ali, whom the Baksh family had sublet the third floor to, rescued his wife and father by taking them out through the neighbour’s terrace. He then went back up to save his children but none of them survived. All three of them were found dead in the morning, said police. According to the Tulsipur Area Police Office Chief DSP Shyamu Aryal, all the victims died due to suffocation. “The top two floors of the building did not catch fire. The bodies of the deceased do not have burn marks. They all seem to have died of suffocation caused by smoke and heat,” said Aryal “They couldn’t escape since the exit was blocked by fire.”A fire engine of Tulsipur Sub-Metropolitan City reached the incident site soon after the fire broke out but ran out of water before it could completely douse the inferno. About an hour later, another fire engine from Ghorahi Sub-Metropolitan City reached the site but the fire had gone out of control by then. The delay in arranging for fire engines greatly affected the rescue operation, according to Aryal. “There weren’t enough fire engines so the fire could not be brought under control immediately,” he said. “We couldn’t reach the victims on time. By the time a water tanker arrived to assist in dousing the fire, it was already morning.”Personnel from Nepal Army and Armed Police Force along with the locals worked together to bring the fire under control and rescue the victims. Chief District Officer of Dang Harilal Regmi, who had reached the incident site in the morning, said it was difficult to douse the fire since the warehouse was filled with plastic products that caught fire easily. “Almost every room and staircase were filled with highly flammable materials, which led to the rapid spread of fire,” he said. The Tulsipur-chapter of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry decided to close Tulsipur market on Friday to mourn the deceased. “We are collecting funds for the bereaved families. We request the business community to come forward and help,” said Binil KC, the secretary-general of the Tulsipur chapter of the federation.","Published at : February 11, 2022",Dang,Durga Lal KC
Families of thalassemia patients under financial strain to afford treatment,"Eleven-year-old Heena Chaudhary, a resident of Madhuwan Municipality-3 in Bardiya district, has been suffering from beta thalassemia for the past two years. Beta thalassemia is an inherited blood disorder in which the body does not produce hemoglobin normally.Heena’s family takes her to Bheri Hospital in Nepalgunj every month for blood transfusions. Her health condition has not only taken an emotional toll on the family but also drained them financially, says Heena’s mother Roshani. “We have to take her to the hospital two to three times a month. We spend at least Rs 5,000 on every visit. We have spent thousands of rupees on her treatment in the past few years and we don’t know how long we will be able to afford it,” said Roshani. “She needs at least 3-4 pints of blood every month. We struggle to manage that.”The Chaudhary couple, who eke out a living as daily wage earners, have two daughters. Heena is the younger one. They say they have spent all their income and savings on the treatment of their daughter and are now financially stretched thin. Diksha Raule, aged eight, of Babai Rural Municipality-6 in Dang district has also been suffering from beta thalassemia for the past few years. She needs to visit Nepalgunj every month for her treatment, and this has put a tremendous financial strain on the Raule family.Heena and Diksha are not isolated cases. The families of many beta thalassemia patients, mainly from impoverished families, are suffering from a huge financial burden to afford regular treatment for their loved ones. The patients of beta thalassemia, according to doctors, need lifelong care that includes regular blood transfusions and medicines. The disease is quite common, like sickle cell anemia, among the Tharu community.According to Bheri Hospital in Nepalgunj, where laboratory tests to diagnose thalassemia and its treatment are available, around a dozen patients suffering from beta thalassemia visit the hospital for treatment on a daily basis. Beta thalassemia patients from several districts of Lumbini, Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces visit Bheri Hospital for treatment.“The families of thalassemia patients have to bear huge costs for treatment and it’s especially difficult for those in the lower income bracket,” said Dr Rajan Pandey, a consultant physician and medical department chief at Bheri Hospital. “Like with sickle cell anemia patients, the government should provide free treatment to beta thalassemia patients as well.”According to Pandey, beta thalassemia patients need blood transfusion frequently and must take medicines lifelong. “While a sickle cell anemia patient needs to visit the hospital once every three or four months, a thalassemia patient needs to visit the hospital every month. Some patients of beta thalassemia need blood transfusion twice or thrice in a month,” he said.Patients of beta thalassemia and their families have been demanding that the government provide them free treatment to ease their financial burden. “We have to sell our land to treat our daughter. Even that won’t be enough because she needs treatment and medicine throughout her life,” said Roshani. “It will be of great help to families like ours if the government provides free treatment to beta thalassemia patients.” The federal government had decided to provide free treatment to patients of sickle cell anemia a few years ago after a large number of people from the Tharu community in western Tarai districts were found suffering from the disease. According to the Bheri Hospital administration, around 4,000 sickle cell anemia patients have received free-of-cost treatment at the hospital so far.Health workers are also of the opinion that the government should manage free-of-cost treatment for thalassemia patients. According to doctors, some patients even need bone marrow transplantation techniques to treat thalassemia but Bheri Hospital does not have this service. “The patient has to go to Kathmandu for this service, which costs around Rs 1 million,” said Pandey. “Not everybody can afford it, that’s why the government must intervene.”","Published at : February 11, 2022",Nepalgunj/kathmandu,Thakur Singh Tharu

"Vaccination drive snags in Lumbini due to shortage of syringes, vaccines","The vaccination drive against Covid-19, which was launched amid a spike in Covid-19 cases, has been hugely affected in Lumbini Province due to a shortage of syringes and vaccines.The vaccination drive has come to a complete halt in some districts while it has failed to gain traction in others. According to the provincial health directorate in Butwal, out of 12 districts of the province, Rupandehi, Palpa and Kapilvastu have reported a shortage of syringes and vaccines.In Kapilvastu, the shortage of both vaccines and syringes brought the vaccination campaign to a complete halt. “The vaccines provided to us lasted only till Saturday. We have informed the provincial health directorate about the matter,” said Hemraj Pandey, chief at the district health office. “The directorate assured us that the vaccines and syringes will be made available in a couple of days.” According to Pandey, Kapilvastu needs around 100,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccines immediately. “Around 60 percent of the eligible population has received both doses of the vaccine while approximately 80 percent people have taken the first dose,” he said. Kapilvastu has so far received Covishield, Vero cell, and Moderna vaccines for specific age groups.In Rupandehi, the vaccination campaign is underway but it is hugely affected and sluggish owing to the short supply of syringes. According to Gaurav Dhakal, the chief at the district health office in Rupandehi, local units have been able to carry out the vaccination drive for only two or three days a week due to the shortage of syringes. “The authorities should provide an equal number of vaccines and syringes. We have sufficient vaccines but no syringes,” said Dhakal. According to him, the district is yet to initiate inoculation of children between 12 and 17 years since they are yet to receive vaccines for the specified age group. There are around 122,000 children in the said age group in Rupandehi.According to Dhakal, 579,303 individuals above the age of 18 have been fully vaccinated while 675,864 individuals have taken the first dose. “We are facing a shortage of syringes. That’s why we haven’t been able to administer the second dose to the remaining population. Only about five percent of eligible people in the district are yet to take a single dose of the vaccine,” he said.Palpa, a hill district of Lumbini Province, has also reported a shortage of syringes. According to the district health office, almost every local unit has been facing a shortage of syringes. All vaccination centres, except for Palpa Hospital, Rampur Hospital and Khasyauli Primary Health Centre, have stopped inoculation. “We have had to stop the vaccination campaign due to the short supply of syringes. We have been administering the vaccines with the remaining syringes only to priority groups such as those leaving for abroad,” said Jhabindra Neupane, chief at the health unit of Tansen Municipality in Palpa.According to the provincial health directorate, it has already informed the federal government about the short supply of syringes. “Kapilvastu and some other districts have also reported to us about vaccine shortages. We have vaccines so we have asked the federal authorities to supply syringes. We haven’t been able to dispatch the vaccines since some employees at the directorate’s vaccine storage facility have been infected with Covid-19,” said Kaushal Bhandari, the Covid-19 focal person at the health directorate. “We will dispatch the vaccines once the employees are fit to return to work.”In Banke, Rukum (East), Nawalaparasi (West), Pyuthan and Rolpa, the vaccination campaign is underway unhindered. According to the district health office in Banke, 333,240 individuals above the age of 18 have received both doses of Covid-19 vaccine while 472,925 people are yet to be inoculated. “We have the vaccines but the remaining number of the eligible population are yet to come forward for vaccination,” said Naresh Babu Shrestha, immunisation officer at the health office. According to him, 12,262 people of Narainapur, the hotspot during the first and second waves of the Covid-19 pandemic, are yet to take the first dose of the vaccine. “We plan to go to Narainapur soon and administer the vaccines,” he said. Lumbini Province reported 577 positive cases on Tuesday. The number of active cases in the province stands at 6,846, according to the provincial health directorate.

Complacency driving up Covid-19 cases in Lumbini,"The number of active cases in Lumbini Province on Thursday stood at 4,166, according to the Health Directorate of the province. The province had logged 912 cases on Wednesday. Although the district administration of Rupandehi has put in a slew of restrictive measures on public gatherings, neither the public nor the local leaders seem to be adhering to the protocol. On Tuesday, two ministers attended the general meeting of a cooperative at Mayadevi-6 in Rupandehi. There were over a hundred participants at the programme, according to Abhay Tiwari, manager of the cooperative.“The cooperative has over 2,000 members. On Tuesday, there were at least 500 people present at the meeting,” he said.Minister of Physical Planning and Infrastructure Sahasram Yadav and Minister of State for Finance and Cooperatives Sushma Yadav were present as guests. The latter did not wear a mask throughout the programme while the other dignitaries on stage did not wear theirs correctly. “I was infected with the virus before and since then I find it very difficult to wear a mask,” said Sushma. “I can’t breathe properly with a mask on.” Health posts, government offices, restaurants, markets and bus parks are still crowded with people, fuelling the further spread of the virus. “The marketplaces are still crowded and people are not following any health safety measures,” said Kabita Panti, a resident of Tilottama Municipality ward 2. “The local administration has halted all essential services but it has stopped short of introducing new directives in line with Covid-19 protocol,” she said Chief District Officer Rishi Ram Tiwari, who is also the coordinator of the District Covid-19 Crisis Management Centre, said, “I am trying to get information about all the big events taking place in the district. I will stop public programmes organised without following health safety protocols as soon as I get the information.” According to the District Administration Office in Rupandehi, some of its employees have been infected with the virus and are currently in isolation. The district administration office has suspended all non-essential services from Wednesday onwards. “Fifteen of our employees have tested positive for coronavirus so we have cut down on our services,” said Tiwari. “We used to have more than 700 service seekers before we suspended non-essential services. We still get around 100 people on a daily basis.”“The Covid-19 infection is spreading like wildfire because of the negligence of the general public and those in decision-making positions,” said Dr Rajan Pandey, physician consultant of Bheri Hospital in Nepalgunj. “People are taking the third wave of the pandemic very lightly because they think the Omicron variant does not do much damage. But that’s not true. This variant of the virus can also do severe damage and make you very sick.” Gatherings of people in political parties’ conventions and overcrowding in marketplaces and government offices are the reasons behind the rise in the infection rate.“If the rate of infection does not hit a plateau soon, our health infrastructure will also be overwhelmed,” said Pandey. “Currently, more than 30 patients have been admitted to Bheri Hospital and are in the ICU on oxygen support.” In Lumbini Cultural Municipality, the number of Covid-19 cases has also increased. “We know the infection has reached the villages so we have started conducting antigen tests on Covid-19 suspects and those who have come in their contact,” said Manmohan Chaudhary, the municipality mayor. In Mayadevi Rural Municipality, some employees of the municipal office, including the chairperson, have tested positive for the virus. “I was working until the day I tested positive so I don’t know how many people came in contact with me,” said Chairman Dhruv Narayan Chaudhary. Although a couple of cases were reported from Kapilvastu's Vijayanagar Municipality, the local unit has not initiated contact tracing of Covid-19 suspects. Chairman Gopal Bahadur Thapa Magar says that steps are being taken to tackle the spread of the virus in the municipality. “We are asking the public to follow health safety protocols,” said Thapa Magar.","Published at : January 22, 2022",Lumbini,Sanju Paudel
Jagadishpur lake receives fewer migratory birds,"The onset of the winter season usually sees the arrival of migratory birds in Jagadishpur Lake, a Ramsar wetland site in Kapilvastu, in large numbers. However, the number of migratory birds making their way toward the lake from the mountainous regions, some from as far as Siberia, has decreased in the last two years, according to ornithologists. The number of bird species in the lake area has decreased by 23 percent in 2022.The bird count was done by Wetland International, a global non-profit organisation that works to sustain and restore wetlands and their resources, in coordination with senior ornithologists Hemsagar Baral, Tika Giri and Dheeraj Chaudhary.The number of birds in the lake in 2021 stood at 12,063; the number was 20,807 in 2020, according to Wetland International. The bird count that started from the south-eastern corner of the 157-hectare lake concluded after reaching the south-western corner.The counting put the number of common Coot at 4,230; Red Crested Pochard at 2,090; Common Teal at 1,085; Lesser whistling duck at 980; Grey Headed Lapwing at 75; Garganey at 55; Northern Pintail at 50 and Anas poecilorhyncha at seven. According to ornithologist Giri, the number of Common Pochard, which is considered rare, is 204. “Three species of birds were counted in the thousands and two bird species in the hundreds,” he said. Eurasian wigeon, Little Cormorant, Great Cormorant and Gadwall along with Ruddy Shelduck, Northern Shoveler, Cotton Pygmy Goose, Common Moorhen, Northern Pintail, Ferruginous Pochard and Mallard were also counted.This year, there were nine fewer species of birds than last year. “Out of 49 species of birds counted last year, only 40 species made the count this year,” said Giri. “Among them, the world's rarest Sarus Crane, Lesser Adjutant and Common Pochard were counted. The count was done based on the colour of the bird, body composition, and sound. The birds were counted using binoculars, GPS, and sound recorders.” Ornithologists say the encroachment of the lake area is one of the leading causes behind the decline in the number of birds migrating to the lake in the past two years. The use of boats is also disturbing the bird population in the lake and surrounding areas, they say. “It is wrong to increase human activities in the places listed in the Ramsar area. Jagadishpur is becoming more and more hostile for the bird population due to excessive hunting. The development of the lake as a tourist spot is also harming the bird population in the area,” said Baral.The lake is spread over an area of 157 hectares and is located in Kapilvastu Municipality-9, 11km north of Taulihawa, the district headquarters. As Nepal’s biggest man-made lake, the Jagadishpur lake has been included in the list of Wetlands of International Importance. It was listed as the international wetland area in August 2003.","Published at : January 19, 2022",Kapilvastu,Manoj Paudel
Children without father or born through second marriages deprived of birth registration,"Kalpana Thapa wedded a married man of Butwal Sub-metropolis-8 around six years ago. The couple soon had a baby girl, who is now five years old. But Thapa has not been able to register her daughter’s birth since her marriage has no legal standing. “I visited the ward office of Butwal-8 several times to register my daughter’s birth. But the people’s representatives and the office employees refused to register her birth citing that she was born out of bigamy,” said Thapa.Thapa attended a public hearing programme organised by the Department of the National ID and Civil Registration in Butwal last week to put her daughter’s case forward. The ward chairman of Butwal-8 Bhim Bahadur Shrestha, who was also in attendance, adamantly refused to entertain Thapa’s request. “We won’t let her (Kalpana) register her daughter’s birth at the office during my tenure,” said Shrestha. “Her marriage is not legal.” The Criminal Code of Nepal, which was enforced on August 17, 2018, has banned bigamy in the country. Such marriages, according to the code, are not legally registered. But the birth registrations of the children born through such marriages are not prevented.However, many women who have children with married men and those whose husbands have gone missing or have abandoned them are unable to register the birth of their children in Rupandehi district.Sarita Thapa of Butwal-3 has to endure a similar ordeal. She wedded a married man in 2006. Her husband left her after she had two children. Both of her children do not have their birth registration certificates.“It is me who gave birth to the children but apparently I don’t have the right to register their birth. The officials at the ward office say births could not be registered without the father. One cannot acquire citizenship without a birth registration certificate. I am very worried that my children will become stateless,” said Sarita.Birth, death, migration, marriage registration and divorce are personal events. The registrations of such personal events are taken as the relation of an individual with the state. So the personal events need to be registered at the ward office within 35 days as per the existing legal provisions.According to the National ID and Civil Registration Act 2020, the birth of a child can be registered if it is informed by the parents or any other member of the same household. But many children are deprived of birth registration certificates under various pretexts. Sita Kanauje of Butwal-11 also has similar difficulties. She married a man who identified as Yam Bahadur Khatri of Baglung. Sita gave birth to three children and raised them up. Yam Bahadur had gone to India for work a few years ago and went out of contact. As a result, Sita could not register the births of her children.“I have a citizenship certificate that I acquired before my marriage. But we don’t have his (Yam Bahadur’s) citizenship. The ward office said births could not be registered without the father’s citizenship. He went missing. I don’t have his citizenship and I don’t know his family members,” Sita said.The Constitution of Nepal 2015 has included child rights in article 39. Sub-article 1 says that every child shall have the right to name and birth registration along with his or her identity.Article 7 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child says that a child shall be registered immediately after birth and shall have the right from birth to a name, right to acquire a nationality. “Where a child is illegally deprived of some or all the elements of his or her identity, state parties shall provide appropriate assistance and protection, with a view to reestablishing his or her identity,” reads article 8 of the same convention.In Nepal, the ward secretary verifies and prepares personal events, including birth registration. Even if a child does not have the necessary documents for birth registration, the people’s representatives like ward chairman, mayor or deputy mayor of a municipality and chief and deputy chief of a rural municipality can register the child’s birth by being an informer. “The ward chairman and people’s representatives can register a child’s birth based on the citizenship certificate of the mother and other documents. But they refuse to provide birth registration certificates to those children. So many children are deprived of birth registration,” said Sabitra Ghimire, a member of the Lumbini Province chapter of the National Federation of the Disabled. According to her, many children of internal migration, children whose fathers are missing and children with physical disabilities are deprived of birth registration certificates.As per the prevailing legal provisions in the country, birth registration certificate is mandatory to acquire a citizenship certificate. Many children are stateless as they are unable to acquire citizenship certificates due to a lack of birth registration documents issued by the ward office.Dil Kumari Roka has been living in Butwal-4 for the past three decades with her three children. Her husband, who was from Okhaldhunga district, had gone to India a few years ago but never returned. “My children are without a citizenship certificate as they do not have a birth registration certificate. I met many people and visited various places but to no avail,” said Dil Kumari.Most of the people’s representatives are well aware about the situation of those children who are deprived of birth registration certificates but they have not taken assertive roles to resolve their issue.Tirthraj Bhattarai, the general director at the department, said the local level should take initiatives to solve the problem in a practical way. “The birth of those children born through bigamy or whose father is not ascertained can be registered on the basis of the citizenship certificate of the mother. The ward secretary can be an informer and register the child’s birth in case his or her mother is also unknown,” said Bhattarai. “Birth registration is the basic right of each child. So the birth registration process should not be complicated.”","Published at : January 18, 2022",Butwal,Amrita Anmol
Human-wildlife conflict goes unchecked in Banke,"Incidents of human-wildlife conflict have been on the rise in Banke National Park and surrounding forests of late. Four people were killed in separate tiger attacks in Banke district in the past three months. All the victims are from Raptisonari Rural Municipality, which borders Banke National Park. However, only one family of the deceased has received the compensation amount of Rs 1 million as of now.“The authorities concerned should protect the local population from wildlife attacks and the victims should be provided suitable compensation at the earliest. Otherwise, we will protest,” said Somati Chaudhary of Phattepur, one of the settlements affected by the increasing number of wildlife attacks.Chandani Tharu, 32, of Raptisonari Rural Municipality-6 is the latest victim of the human-wildlife conflict in Banke. Tharu was mauled to death by a tiger on January 8 while collecting sal tree leaves in a nearby forest. Similarly, 52-year-old Lila Bista of Raptisonari-4 died in another tiger attack at a local forest on January 6.As per the prevailing legal provisions, the family of those killed in wildlife attacks has to be provided Rs1 million as compensation. But the bereaved families of both Chandani and Lila are yet to receive the amount.The delay in providing the compensation amount on time has caused misunderstandings to arise among the local population and the officials of Banke National Park, the Division Forest Office and the home administration.The Lumbini Provincial government on Friday provided Rs 50,000 each to the families of Chandani and Lila from its relief fund while Raptisonari Rural Municipality had earlier provided Rs 20,000 each to the families as immediate relief.However, the local population are demanding that the authorities immediately release the full compensation amount of Rs 1 million to the families of the victims. “The government authorities should promptly release the relief amount to the families,” said Somati.According to Dadhilal Kandel, the chief at the Division Forest Office in Banke, the office is working to release the amount as soon as possible but the legal process to avail of the compensation is lengthy and cumbersome.“The local residents would be happy if the compensation is released at the earliest,” said Surya Bahadur Khatri, the chief district officer of Banke. “There won’t be any delay on my part. The national park and the division forest office should expedite work to release the compensation promptly.” As per the tiger census conducted in 2018, there are a total of 235 tigers and 21 of them are in Banke National Park.","Published at : January 17, 2022",Nepalgunj,J Pandey
Gender bias forcing women into sex-selective abortions,"Sabitri Thapa was 24 years old when she first had an abortion. In the next seven years, she would have undergone two more abortions. Sabitri, who asked her real name to be withheld, is now 42 years old and lives in Nepalgunj-5 in Banke.All three of her abortions were the result of her family’s desire for a son. A mother of two teenage daughters and one son, Sabitri says she could not stand up to her family members alone without the support of her husband. “Sadly for me, my husband also wanted a son. During each pregnancy I was forced to get an ultrasound done to determine the sex of my foetus by my husband,” she said. “I was pregnant with a girl thrice but couldn’t keep them.”Only after the birth of her son did her painful experiences with abortions end. “Three abortions in seven years had a great impact on my health,” she said. “I have recovered from the physical trauma my body suffered from frequent pregnancies and equally frequent abortions. But my mental health is still in shambles.” Studies have shown frequent abortions have long-lasting implications on a woman’s reproductive health resulting in complications in future pregnancies or worse, says Jageshwar Gautam, consultant gynaecologist & obstetrician at Om Hospital and Research Centre.The elective procedure also has a long-term effect on mental health especially if the woman goes for the procedure under duress, says Dr Prabhakar Pokharel, consultant psychiatrist at KIST hospital in Kathmandu.“All that has happened to me was done to me by my family,’ said Sabitri. “I am happy with my daughters and did not harbour any desire to bear a son but I was under immense pressure to give birth to a boy.” Sex-selective abortions are illegal in Nepal and carry a prison term for the guilty but the easy availability of pre-natal sex determination technologies make female foeticide a commonplace practice. Like several other countries in South Asia, Nepal has a visible preference for sons with many citing religious and socio-economic reasons.“I have undergone abortion twice since my husband and his family wanted a son,” said Kavita BK, a 38-year-old woman from Nepalgunj sub metropolis. Kavita too asked her real name to be withheld for privacy reasons.“They say that it’s a wife’s obligation to give birth to a son. They say sons are important in our society. They didn’t want to take a chance in case we had a baby girl so I was forced to undergo abortions after sex determination tests revealed I was carrying girls both times,” said Kavita. As per The Right to Safe Motherhood and Reproductive Health Act, 2018, abortion is permitted up to 12 weeks of gestational age on the request of the pregnant woman, up to 18 weeks of gestational age in the case of rape or incest and at any gestational age if the pregnancy is detrimental to the woman’s health and life or if there is foetal impairment.“Abortions should be done within the legal framework,” Durga Laxmi Shrestha, Nursing in-charge at Bheri Hospital told the Post. “We do the procedure for reasons such as if the health of the mother and her baby is compromised or in case of incest and rape.” Basundhara Gyawali, a nurse in the maternity ward at the hospital, says the hospital doesn’t see a lot of first time prospective parents coming for abortions and it’s usually parents with daughters who come and seek abortions. “But we don’t entertain them and in fact, dissuade them from going for it. Some are not aware of the legal repercussions of sex-selective abortions,” she said. Gyawali recounts incidents wherein new parents celebrate the birth of a son and get visibly upset if their newborn is a girl. “I think it boils down to social conditioning. In Nepal, boys are celebrated and the birth of a girl is bemoaned.” Basanta Gautam, a human rights and gender equality activist based out of Banke, says sex-selective abortions are possible mostly because of easy access to such procedures through private clinics and lax monitoring of such clinics by the authorities. “An increasing number of medical practitioners are found involved in illegal abortions in Banke,” he claimed. “Sex-selective abortions are happening in broad daylight but the authorities have not done much about it. Legal action is hardly taken against those who seek such illegal services and those who provide it,” he said. Dr Ankur Bhandari, gynaecologist at Bheri Hospital, says sex-determination technology is a mark of advancement in the medical field but that the technology is being misused.“Prenatal tests such as ultrasounds are important in pregnancies but since it can determine the sex of the foetus, this technology is being widely misused as a gateway for illegal abortions,” he said. In the past year alone, 189 women visited Bheri Hospital seeking treatment for adverse health effects caused by unsafe abortions, said Bhandari. The Safe Maternity and Reproductive Health Act, 2075, states pregnant women should not be coerced into identifying the sex of the foetus by intimidation or terror, or by improper influence and deception. The National Criminal Code, 2074, allows imprisonment to parents and service providers between one and five years, depending on the period of pregnancy and a penalty of Rs 10,000 to Rs 50,000.However, no one has been sentenced or fined for committing such a crime in Nepal so far.Head Constable Nabin Thapa at District Police Office in Banke, says the local police have not encountered cases of sex-selective abortions so far. “Many years ago a woman had filed a complaint against her family for forcing her to abort but she soon withdrew her statement and a formal case was never registered,” he said. “No one has come to us to report clinics engaged in illegal activities but if any victim comes to us to file a case, we will take action against the guilty as dictated by law.”“Cases of forced abortions rarely come to light because of fear instilled in the women by their family members,” said Gautam. “The women share their stories only after the abortion is done. This could be the reason why Banke sees more births of sons than daughters.” According to the data from Bheri Hospital last year, the number of newborn sons is higher than newborn girls in Banke. The hospital data shows 2,430 females and 2,742 males were born in the fiscal year 2019-2020. Likewise, 1,779 females and 2,060 males were born in Banke district in the fiscal year 2020-2021.“Gender-based violence, religious bigotry behind gender identity and discrimination in power relations have made this issue very sensitive; we need to work towards raising awareness in society about the causative factors that lead to female foeticide,” said Kamala Pant, another human rights activist based out of Banke. “The discrimination girls face even when they are not yet born is what fuels the fire of gender violence and fails to create a safe environment for girls to live.” “Only when the Nepali society begins to understand the importance of daughters and values their lives as much as that of sons, can we expect to see a decline in couples engaging in illegal sex-selective abortions,” said Pant. Thirty-six-year old Sanju Dhungana from Nepalgunj-12, is still trying for a son. Sanju, who asked her real name to be withheld, is a mother to two daughters. A victim of forced abortions, she was forced to undergo sex-determination tests by her family twice. “Both times I was pregnant with girls and my family asked me to get an abortion,” she said. “They still want a son. The lack of awareness about gender equality and a desire for a male heir are some of the reasons why women like me have been forced to go through hell and live with guilt for the rest of our lives.”","Published at : January 13, 2022",Nepalgunj/kathmandu,Rupa Gahatraj						 &
Covid tests at Nepal-India border points show cases are surging,"The sudden uptick in Covid-19 cases along the Nepal-India border points in the last few days has worried health workers about the looming threat of the virus spreading in the communities.While carrying out antigen tests on 328 people who entered Nepal Tuesday, 56 people were found to be positive for Covid-19. The figures were 45, 39 and 29 on Monday, Sunday and Saturday respectively, according to Loknath Kandel, a lab technician of the health desk set up at the Belahiya border point in Rupandehi district of Lumbini Province.“The 45 positive samples from Monday have been sent to Kathmandu for a whole genome sequencing test,” said Kandel. Although there are health desks set up at border points to screen those entering Nepal for Covid-19, health workers fear it is not enough to prevent the virus from entering villages and towns. Earlier, the government had set up isolation centres and quarantine facilities for those returning to their home districts. This year, authorities in several districts and local units have not prepared such facilities for returnees.“During the first two waves of the pandemic, those who tested positive for the virus were taken to isolation and quarantine centres in their villages. But this year, there are no such provisions,” said Kandel. “Those who test positive are asked to go home and self-isolate but people are barely following safety protocols. Those carrying the virus are also roaming in public.”Kamal Prasad Pandey, the assistant chief district officer of Rupandehi, said plans are underway to set up isolation centres and manage separate vehicles to take the infected people to their respective local units but the plans are yet to come into action.The government authorities failed to make adequate preparations for the possible third wave of the pandemic as they have yet to introduce curbs on public movement, says Kandel. “Although India has already declared a third wave, Nepal is allowing Indian tourists to come into Nepal if they are fully vaccinated. But even vaccinated people are carrying the virus,” said Kandel. “People here go to the bordering towns everyday. If this movement continues, it will be difficult to control the spread of the virus in the days to come.”The free movement of people across the border has also led to an outbreak of the virus among the health workers deployed at the border points. Junga Bahadur Bhandari of Bajura, an assistant lab technician from Siddharthanagar Municipality of Rupandehi, was deployed at the health desk in Belahiya border point three months ago. He tested positive for the virus this week. “I tested positive during antigen testing a few days ago. A polymerase chain reaction test confirmed Covid-19 infection in me three days ago,” said Bhandari.Diya Sharma, another lab technician deployed at the Belahiya health desk, also tested positive for the virus a few days ago.“I might have caught the virus while collecting samples for testing at the health desk. The traffic at the border point has not abated even after the surge in the number of positive cases. People go to the bordering Indian towns to shop and do not follow health safety protocol. This has accelerated the rate at which the virus is spreading,” said Sharma.Covid-19 cases are also surging in Jamunaha border point of Banke and Krishnanagar border point of Kapilvastu district.A 38-year-old woman of Bardiya, who went to New Delhi to meet her husband who works there, was returning home through Jamunaha on Monday. She tested positive after an antigen test at the border health desk the same day. Twelve others tested positive at Jamunaha that day.The figure significantly rose on Tuesday. As many as 37 entrants were found positive on antigen tests on 396 people at Jamunaha border point. Of late, the number of people entering Nepal through Jamunaha border point has increased. “Around 1,000 people enter Nepal through this border point on a daily basis. We have intensified testing and sent suspect cases to isolation centres. But many people are using alternate routes to enter the country,” said Gita Shahi, a health worker deployed at the health desk in Jamunaha border point. Similarly, Covid-19 cases are increasing at Krishnanagar border point of Kapilvastu. According to Pankaj Gupta, the coordinator at the health desk set up at the border point, nine people tested positive for Covid-19 on Saturday. As many as 27 out of 151 antigen tests carried out on Monday came back positive. Fourteen more entrants tested positive on Tuesday.“There are no isolation centres in Krishnanagar as of now. The infected people have been advised to stay in home isolation,” said Shankar Bhattarai, the health unit chief of Krishnanagar Municipality.Covid-19 cases are also on the rise in Kanchanpur, a Tarai district of Sudurpaschim Province, as the district is seeing an increase in the number of migrant workers returning home from India.On Tuesday, 86 people tested positive for Covid-19 in Kanchanpur. Seventy-one among them entered Nepal through Gaddachauki border point. According to the District Health Office, 15 people from various local units also tested positive for the virus.A health desk set up at the Gaddachauki border point conducted antigen testing on 538 entrants who were returning home from various parts of India and 36 of them were found to be positive for the virus.Kanchanpur, which borders India, currently has 330 active cases of Covid-19. According to the District Health Office, 79 infected people are receiving treatment at the isolation ward of the Mahakali Provincial Hospital while 251 are in home isolation.On Tuesday, Nepal reported a total of 2,444 Covid positive cases, which included 1,981 positive cases from 10,648 polymerase chain reaction tests and 463 positive cases from 4385 antigen tests. Also, one death was reported.(Rupa Gahatraj in Nepalgunj, Manoj Paudel in Kapilvastu and Bhawani Bhatta in Kanchanpur contributed reporting.)","Published at : January 12, 2022",Lumbini,Sanju Paudel
11 killed and 16 injured in separate accidents on Sunday,"Eleven people were killed in separate road accidents across the country on Sunday.In Palpa, seven people died and 16 others were injured when a bus veered off the road at Ribdikot Rural Municipality in Palpa on Sunday morning. The accident occurred at around 10:00 am. At least 30 people were on board the bus travelling to Kaligandaki from Butwal for a funeral, according to police. According to the DSP Santosh Kumar Bhattarai, the bus that left Butwal at around 6:30 am fell some 60 metres down the road from a steep hillside along the Tansen-Ridi road section at Laghuwa in the rural municipality. “Three of the deceased were thrown out of the bus during the accident while four other bodies were trapped inside the vehicles,” said Bhattarai, “We had to use an excavator to retrieve the bodies.”Police informed that three men–aged 30, 40 and 31–of Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City, and four men– aged 28, 25, 33 and 36– of Malrani Municipality in Arghakhanchi district were among the deceased. Of the injured, nine people are receiving treatment at Lumbini Medical College in Prabhas while seven are undergoing treatment at Palpa Mission Hospital, according to the police. The injured have sustained injuries to their head, back, chest, hand and feet. Passengers who escaped major injuries informed that the accident occured when the driver of the bus could not make a sharp turn due to overspeeding. “The road section was steep and it was wet and slippery due to the dew,” said Krishna Bahadur Nepali, one of the injured passengers of the bus, “The bus was also overspeeding when the accident occured.” In Sarlahi, three people died after the motorcycle they were riding went out of control and collided with a tree at Ishwarpur Municipality. The two-wheeler was heading towards Baibas when it met with an accident in the Sagarnath forest area. Police informed that a 22-year-old man and two 20-year-olds of Dasbigha in the municipality died on the spot following the accident. The police are yet to ascertain the time of the accident.Locals from the area had notified the police after they saw the bodies of the deceased in the morning. “They may have lost their balance on the motorcycle due drunk driving or thick fog,” said the area police. “The bodies of the deceased have been brought to the district hospital in Sarlahi.”Likewise, another motorcycle accident in Golbazar of Siraha district claimed the life of a man from Kyalpur Municipality. According to the police, the 25-year-old man after receiving first-aid treatment at Bhumija Hospital in Golbazar was referred to Lahan for further treatment. “He died while on the way to the hospital,” informed SP Santos Rai of the Area Police Office, Golbazaar.","Published at : January 2, 2022",Palpa,Madhab Aryal
Cases of sexual abuse of women go unreported in Banke,"Two years ago, the then 17-year-old girl approached the District Police Women and Children Service Centre in Banke with a complaint against her cousin who she said was making inappropriate advances towards her. The girl alleged that the man under the pretext of being family took advantage of her sexually.But when the accused was brought to the police, he outright denied any wrongdoing. He said he was only teasing the girl and since she was his cousin, it was not a big deal, said Shyam Kumari Thapa, the then chief at the centre.“The man insisted that he had done no wrong, that he was only fooling around with his cousin,” said Thapa. “But when a man as much as looks at a woman in a way that makes the woman uncomfortable is punishable by law. But this man was adamant that he had done no wrong in making advances at his cousin,” she said.The victim persisted in her allegations but soon had to withdraw her complaint under immense family pressure. “Her family didn’t understand what she was going through. They put pressure on her to withdraw her complaint and to not register a police case against her cousin to save the man from disgrace,” said Thapa.Thapa says she was determined to proceed with the case but she was not successful. “We were unable to help the victim. How could we have when she changed her statement albeit under coercion?” said Thapa. “Under our existing laws, any act of touching, looking, speaking with sexual undertones is categorised as sexual abuse. The perpetrator can be jailed between a minimum of three months and a maximum three years based on the nature of such cases,” she said. But in this case, law enforcement could not take action since the victim withdrew her verbal complaint and refused to register a formal complaint against her cousin. “They went for an out-of-court settlement. This is not a solitary case where women are forced to retract their complaints against their perpetrators by their family.” A few weeks ago, the chief administrative officer and accounts officer of Khajura Rural Municipality in Banke were accused of sexually abusing a female employee. It was reported that the duo sexually abused the female employee, who is in her mid-thirties, while on a picnic at Tikapur in Kailali. The victim, a medical doctor by profession, informed police verbally about the abuse but later withdrew her complaint. “The victim signed an agreement with the accused to settle the case. She did not register a written complaint against her abusers so we could not take any action,” said Deputy Superintendent of Police in Banke Madhu Sudan Neupane.The alleged sexual abuse of the woman came to the public’s notice five days after the incident when some women picketed the rural municipality office, demanding legal action against the accused.According to police, the cases of sexual abuse are weak and the accused are usually let free because the victims withdraw their complaints on their own accord or under pressure from family. Ekmaya BK, the vice-chairman of Khajura Rural Municipality, who is also the coordinator of the judicial committee at the local level, says most cases of sexual abuse and violence against women end up getting closed since the complainants reach a compromise with the accused. According to human rights advocate Basanta Gautam, any sort of sexual abuse warrants the case to be registered as a criminal case. “There is no law to “settle” such cases once they are registered with the police,” said Gautam. “But in most cases, the victims of sexual abuse are forced to settle the cases before the legal procedure begins. That is why so many cases of sexual abuse go unreported,” he said.According to Dilsara Rana, the chief at the woman cell of the District Police Office in Banke, around 90 percent of cases involving sexual abuse of women end in “agreement” between the victims and accused. “The perpetrators do not face legal action as the victims do not file a police complaint against them. Even when the victims have filed a verbal complaint, they do not follow it up with a written one due to pressures from the family and society,” said Rana.Three years ago, the ward chairman of Nepalgunj Sub-metropolitan City-8 harassed a Banke-based female journalist, who is in her late 30s, by posting profane posts on social media. The victim, who asked for anonymity since she does not want to relive the experience in retrospect, was mentally stressed. She informed the police but her husband, who is a political leader, asked her to not register a complaint against the ward chair. “Even rights activists and our neighbours urged me to not file a case with the police. The ward chair apologised to me and I was under pressure to accept it,” she said. “Only 10 percent cases of sexual abuse are reported. In 90 percent of cases, the victims approach us and lodge verbal complaints but they retract their statement and do not lodge a formal complaint with the police,” said Rana, chief at the woman cell of the District Police Office. “This happens mostly under duress from family and community,” she said.","Published at : December 20, 2021",Banke,Madhu Shahi
Tourism boom in tri-city area in central Tarai loses steam after Covid-19,"Butwal, Bhairahawa and Lumbini were on the way to becoming Nepal's second largest cities after Kathmandu with the way the hospitality industry was flourishing in this tri-city area in the central Tarai.More than 10,000 jobs have opened in the hotel sector since construction work began on a new international airport in Bhairahawa, which will be the second one in the country after the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu.Then Covid-19 pandemic swept in and everything fell apart.Sujit Gaha of Syangja, an experienced chef currently working at Faze Restaurant & Cafe in Bhairahawa, will not be getting a raise for months—or even years—until the industry returns to normal.He, currently, earns Rs40,000 monthly, and is not satisfied with the salaries the hotels and restaurants are paying their skilled workers.“It is difficult to get skilled people,” said Gaha. “The low pay has been causing a massive brain drain.”Gaha had completed a chef training course at the Kantipur Hotel Training Centre in Pokhara, Kaski in 2010, and set out as an intern without a salary to get hands-on experience. Now he has become a skilled chef.The coronavirus pandemic spoiled everything.The tourism industry bore the brunt of the virus when arrivals sank to all-time lows, and travel traders have been desperately looking for signs of a revival. But the anticipated resurgence has been excruciatingly slow with tourist arrivals still 80 percent below 2019 levels.After the second Covid-19 wave hit Nepal in April, the country slid into a devastating crisis with the authorities enforcing strict lockdown measures. About two months later, the restrictions were relaxed gradually, and since September 1, almost everything has been allowed to reopen.Subsequently, Nepal saw the highest post-Covid monthly arrivals in October, pushing the total number since the start of the year past the 100,000 mark.According to data released by the Nepal Tourism Board, Nepal welcomed 23,284 foreign tourists by air in October.The number, however, did not improve as expected despite the full-fledged reopening.In November, the country’s peak tourism season, there were 26,487 arrivals. According to the board, in the 11 months of 2021, Nepal received just over 126,000 tourists.And now the Omicron scare has kept the world on tenterhooks. The new iteration of the coronavirus, which the World Health Organisation says has spread to 57 countries, has emerged as a cause for concern for Nepal’s tourism sector as well. The sluggish revival coupled with the Omicron threat has eroded the prospects of hospitality industry workers getting their jobs back.In Bhairahawa, too, despite many properties being developed, hiring has not picked up after a long lull. There is a shortage of skilled manpower, but the industry is not much worried. Tara Chaudhary of Kailali has been working at Siddhartha Cottage in Butwal for five years. He had completed two years of hotel management training and was hired at Siddhartha Cottage in Tikapur, Kailali.""Initially, I had to wipe and clean the hotel floor,” he said. After a long struggle, he is now a captain in-charge (restaurant manager) at the hotel. He urges aspiring workers to get training before joining the profession. As the hotel industry is expanding in the once sleepy city of Bhairahawa following the construction of the second international airport, which has been named Gautam Buddha International Airport as it has been styled as the gateway to Lumbini, a wave of a new generation of entrepreneurs is coming.There is a huge demand for skilled workers along with the growth in infrastructure.New cafés and restaurants are popping up in every nook and cranny. Nearly a dozen luxury hotels are being launched in Bhairahawa. Tourism was largely affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. Some hotels and restaurants were forced to lay off skilled workers. Skilled workers are migrating abroad, according to hotel entrepreneurs.Ram Prasad Gautam, president of the Hotel and Restaurant Association in Rupandehi, said that the sector was experiencing a shortage of skilled manpower due to the pandemic. ""Normally, large hotels employ more than 50 workers each, but it has been difficult to retain them,"" he said. ""Salaries range from Rs15,000 to Rs100,000 monthly, depending on experience."" Gautam said that they had made arrangements to provide training to workers by involving the Restaurant and Bar Association, Rupandehi which has more than 25 restaurants as members.Sagar Poudyal, vice-president of the association, said these restaurants currently employ 15 workers each. The 46 hotels affiliated to the Siddhartha Hotel Association in Bhairahawa together employ nearly 3,500 people. There are 110 hotels affiliated with the Lumbini Hotel Association which provided jobs to 3,500 people before the pandemic. Now, there are only 1,500 workers at the hotels.Govinda Gyawali, president of the association, said a large number of hotels had still not reopened, and this had indirectly affected thousands of jobs. Investors are making big investments in Bhairahawa. The hotels and restaurants that were gradually recovering from the Covid disaster have started to panic following reports of the emergence of new variants. In a bid to lessen the risk of an outbreak of Omicron the Ministry of Health and Population has recommended a mandatory seven-day quarantine for all people returning from abroad.Industry insiders say amid the uncertainty, they don’t see the revival of the sector anytime soon.“Young people want to learn and enjoy working in restaurants,” said Poudyal, the vice president of the Restaurant and Bar Association, Rupandehi. “But the number of workers joining the industry and quitting is about equal, and this has been a continuous process.”","Published at : December 13, 2021",Kathmandu,Sanju Paudel
Cholera yet to be contained in Kapilvastu,"The cholera outbreak that started in Krishnanagar Municipality of Kapilvastu district in October first week is yet to be contained. The infection continues to spread amid the vaccination drive launched by the Ministry of Health and Population.A 13-year-old girl is the latest victim of the cholera outbreak in Kapilvastu, a western Tarai district of Lumbini Province. According to the District Health Office, the teenager, a resident of Mahuwa settlement in Buddhabhumi Municipality-6, died of cholera while undergoing treatment at Taulihawa Hospital on Sunday evening. With this, the death toll of the cholera outbreak in Kapilvastu reaches seven.“Cholera infection was confirmed after we carried out an RDT antigen test of the deceased’s stool sample. The situation is not good in the district. Everyone should come together to contain the outbreak,” said Umesh Ghimire, the epidemic control focal person at the District Health Office. The disease, which broke out in wards 7, 8 and 9 of Krishnanagar Municipality in the first week of October, has now spread to seven other local units of the district—Krishnanagar, Shivaraj, Maharajgunj and Kapilvastu municipalities and Bijayanagar, Yashodhara, Buddhabhumi and Mayadevi rural municipalities. As many as 14 people were found infected with cholera while carrying out RDT antigen tests at wards 5, 6, 7, 8 and 10 of Bhuddhabhumi and ward 7 of Mayadavi in the past week. Similarly, cholera was detected in a patient from Kapilvastu Municipality-1.“The RDT antigen testing confirmed cholera infection in 15 patients. The stool samples were taken to the provincial laboratory in Butwal for further testing. The culture testing of the samples also confirmed cholera,” said Hemraj Pandey, chief at the District Health Office.Cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, which leads to dehydration and even death within a few hours if left untreated. Escherichia coli, or E. coli, are bacteria that normally live in the intestines of people and animals. Most types of E. coli are harmless and even help keep the digestive tract healthy. But some strains can cause diarrhoea when one eats or drinks contaminated food and water.To prevent cholera infection, health workers suggest a high level of hygiene and sanitation be put into practice and drinking clean water as cholera is a water-borne disease. Dr Jabed Khan, a consultant physician at the district hospital in Taulihawa, warned that the effectiveness of the cholera vaccination depends on sanitation. “People won’t suffer from cholera if they are careful about sanitation,” he said. The cholera epidemic has so far claimed seven lives, including four minors. Four patients of Krishnanagar and one each from Shivaraj, Yashodhara and Buddhabhumi died of cholera in October.The oral cholera vaccination campaign is underway at Krishnanagar, Shivaraj, Maharajgunj, Bijayanagar and Yashodhara local units of Kapilvastu since November 27. The authorities aim to vaccinate 252,363 people.","Published at : November 30, 2021",Kapilvastu,Manoj Paudel
Local units in Rukum (East) expand health services in villages,"The local governments of Rukum (East) have expanded health services so that people in their respective villages can access quality health care.All six local units in the district now have well-equipped hospitals and health facilities with at least one Auxiliary health worker and Auxiliary nurse-midwife in each ward, according to Devilal Gautam, mayor of Musikot Municipality. Previously, only Musikot and Chaujahari municipalities had fully-functional hospitals. People from all local units had to travel to Musikot Municipality, where the district hospital is based, to seek treatment even for minor illnesses.But with the local units establishing health centres in a majority of wards, people can access health services in their own villages now.Dil Kumari Oli, a resident of Chaurjahari-12, said that the operation of health centres in her ward has helped many people get immediate medical attention, saving them the trouble of visiting health facilities outside their villages. ""The municipality has established a new health post in ward 10. We don’t have to go to the district hospital anymore to get treatment,” said Oli. “We can even get vaccination services, family planning facilities and general treatment near our homes.”Athabiskot Municipality is operating a 25-bed municipal hospital at Radi in ward 9 of the municipality. Similarly, a 15-bed hospital has been opened at Kholagau of ward 10 in Chaurjahari, a 15-bed hospital in Chhotebagar of ward 7 in Sanibheri and a 15-bed hospital in Kharaneta of ward 3 in Triveni.“Some wards even have two health centres. The local governments decided to establish health posts and hospitals in the villages so that all residents can have access to timely medical facilities,” said mayor Gautam. According to Gautam, the hospitals built by the local governments of the district have treated about 62,000 patients so far.Danda Prasad Sharma, the health coordinator of Chaurjahari Municipality, said that the general public has been receiving health services in their own villages.“The local government is focused on fulfilling the basic needs of the local residents and that includes health care,” said Gorkha Bahadur KC, chief of Athabiskot Municipality. “We will continue providing quality services to the people of our municipality.” Earlier, 35 health posts were in operation in the district. Following the local units’ initiative, an additional 38 health centres have been added. The local units were allocated Rs3.8 million by the federal government to construct the health centres. They have been operating the health centres by hiring health workers on a contract basis.","Published at : November 28, 2021",Rukum (east),Hari Gautam
Local unit provides aid to students from poor families,"A local unit in Arghakhanchi, a hill district of Lumbini Province, has started providing education assistance to five students from this fiscal year with an objective to produce skilled human resources in the technical field.Malarani Rural Municipality has selected five academically gifted students from Dalit and impoverished families for the education assistance scheme. According to the local unit, as many as 17 students had applied for the assistance to study various technical subjects.A beneficiary receives Rs 100,000 assistance each year for five years.Krishna Bahadur BK was selected for the grant for medical science; Prakash Paudel for engineering; Bishal Khanal for forestry science; Mahesh Acharya for agriculture science; and Sushil Khanal for veterinary science. The financial assistance has come as a boon for all the selected candidates who come from economically poor backgrounds. Without the grant, they would not have been able to pursue higher education.“My mother has been taking loans from relatives and neighbours to fund my studies so far. I need around Rs 150,000 a year for my MBBS course, which my family cannot afford. But now with the amount provided by the rural municipality, our burden has lightened,” said BK, who is pursuing MBBS at the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College.Sushil Khanal of Khana, another beneficiary of the education assistance, is a veterinary science student in Bhairahawa. “Our family is financially weak. I was very worried about how my parents would fund my education expenses,” said Khanal. If he hadn’t been selected as a beneficiary for the financial assistance scheme of the local unit, he would have been forced to quit, he says. According to Ramesh Panthi, the chief administrative officer at Malarani Rural Municipality, the local unit will provide the financial assistance to the selected candidates from the current fiscal year. “Any student born in Malarani and enrolled in a college in the technical stream studies is eligible for the education assistance,” he said.A student receiving the assistance should work for at least three years in the rural municipality after completing his/her studies, according to the local unit. “This will help us fill the void left by the absence of educated and skilled professionals in the field of technical science. If the students set up their practice in the rural municipality, the local people will benefit,” said Balkrishna Acharya, chairman of Malarani Rural Municipality.Mahesh Acharya, another recipient of the education assistance, said that he would work in the agricultural field in his own local unit after completing his bachelor’s degree in agricultural science. “Production of food crops is decreasing, as people leave their land fallow. I will focus on creating employment opportunities in the village through agricultural entrepreneurship,” he said.","Published at : November 21, 2021",Arghakhanchi,Birendra KC
Butwal continues to pollute Tinau River with its waste,"Butwal Sub-metropolitan City, which is responsible for collecting and managing garbage from in and around the city, has been dumping its waste on the banks of Tinau River for years. This has caused massive pollution in the river area, adversely affecting the residents of nearby settlements.According to Bhuwa Prasad Luintel, senior officer at the sub-metropolis office, the city dumps its waste on the riverbanks, as it does not have a local waste processing centre.“The city has been dumping its waste in the ditches along the riverbank so as to avoid the garbage from entering the river,” said Luintel, “Once the ditches are filled, we cover them up and move on to another area to dump the city’s waste.”Butwal, one of the major cities in western Nepal, produces around 60 tonnes of garbage on a daily basis. The city does not have a designated dumping site or a processing centre. Data from the sub-metropolitan showed that around 70 percent of the collected waste is biodegradable while the remaining waste can be processed and recycled. However, in the absence of a waste processing centre, the city has opted to dump its garbage along the river banks. The east side of the Tinau River spanning from Kandhaghari to Majhuwa is turning into a landfill site, local residents say.Despite it being the responsibility of the local governments to keep the water bodies and forests free from pollutants, major cities and municipalities in Rupandehi have been dumping their waste products in local rivers and forests for years. Starting this year, Butwal has begun dumping its waste materials on the west side of the river, stating that the city would build a roadway after the ditches near Majhuwa are filled. The settlements on the west side of the river that were already at risk of erosion and flooding are now facing a new ordeal with the metropolis starting to dump garbage near their homes.“We had gone to the sub-metropolitan office to request the construction of an embankment but the office told us it will begin construction only after the ditches are filled,” said Singh Bahadur Bogati, chairman of the Local Waste Management Committee. “The foul smell of garbage has made our lives miserable, but we are tolerating it in hopes that the embankment will be constructed soon and our homes will be safe.”The waste materials that are dumped along the river banks not only emit foul smell but during monsoons, the covered dumping ditches are exposed and the garbage flows towards the settlements, farmlands and forests, affecting the local biodiversity.“The water sources in the city have become polluted due to the garbage. Local aquatic plants are dying due to the presence of excessive chemicals in the river,” said Narayan Bhattarai, environmental expert at the Ministry of Forest, Environment and Soil Conservation of Lumbini Province. “This is affecting the biodiversity of the region.”With the increase in population, the then Butwal Municipality had planned to construct a waste processing centre 21 years ago and the budget for the same has been allocated multiple times. Studies were conducted for the project but the work never took off from the ground level. In 2010, the city signed an agreement with the Asian Development Bank to construct a waste processing centre with the capacity of processing 83 tonnes of waste daily at a cost of Rs370 million. However, the project that was slated to complete by 2015 was scrapped in 2018 after the local residents protested and refused to let the city bring its waste near their settlements.Meanwhile, Butwal, along with Sainamaina Municipality and Kanchan Rural Municipality, has now planned the construction of a waste processing plant at Sainamaina, which will cost around Rs 1 billion. However, since the project is in its initial stage, it is unclear as to when and how the processing centre will be constructed.“Since it is a big project, it will take at least two years to finalise the details,” said Butwal’s Mayor Shivaraj Subedi.","Published at : November 13, 2021",Butwal,Amrita Anmol
Lungrimadi Irrigation Project left incomplete for three decades,"An ambitious irrigation project that was initiated in Swargadwari Municipality of Pyuthan 34 years ago is yet to see completion. The government had started the construction of Lungrimadi Irrigation Project in 1987 with the objective of irrigating around 230 hectares of land in Swargadwari by channelising water from the Lungri stream of neighbouring Rolpa district. Under the project, a 12km-long canal was constructed to provide irrigation facilities to around 1,000 local farmers of Sari, Belbas and Barjibang. But over the years, in the absence of maintenance and repair works, the canal has been left in a dilapidated state.Given the lengthy delay, the farmers have given up all hopes for the successful completion of the project. “We have been waiting for over three decades but nothing has happened so far,” said Buddhiram Bhandari of Swargadwari-5. “The project started during the Panchayat era and was forgotten for some years with the beginning of the democratic ruling system in 1990. Then came the Maoist insurgency that did more harm than good to development projects. Now with the federal system in place, there is still no hope.” According to Bhandari, hectares of land in the area have been left fallow due to a lack of irrigation facilities. “We have to depend on rainfall to cultivate our fields. This year, I was able to transplant paddy in my field after four years, as the country experienced heavy rainfall,” said Bhandari. “We have been anxiously waiting for the project to be completed but we lose hope every year.” According to the Irrigation Division Office in Pyuthan, a total of Rs130 million has been spent on the project in the past three decades. Aside from the monetary expense, the local residents say that their labour donation has also gone to waste. “In 2017, the authorities said that water would be released into the canal. All the villagers went to the project site and cleaned the canal but we soon found out that it was just an election hook by political parties and their leaders,” said Shyamlal Regmi of Swargadwari-5. “The irrigation canal project has been an election slogan in each election but none of the political leaders has stepped up to see the project through.” According to the locals, the condition of the irrigation canal has further deteriorated, as the Water Resource and Irrigation Division Office in Pyuthan has stopped conducting regular maintenance work in the past few years. In the last fiscal year, the Physical Infrastructure Ministry of Lumini Province had surveyed the irrigation project to decide on its future. “But we have not received any report or instruction from the ministry yet. We cannot say anything about the irrigation project right now,” said Nabaraj Pokharel, an engineer at the Resource and Irrigation Division Office.The irrigation canal has been damaged in several places due to frequent landslides. Roads abutting the canal have also been damaged over the years. “The canal from Jutung stream to Lungri stream is not usable. Major repair and construction work has to be done if the canal is to be used for irrigation,” said Regmi.","Published at : November 10, 2021",Pyuthan,Shamsher Bikram GC
"Five months on, vehicular movement along Ranimahal-Ramdi stretch yet to resume","Vehicular movement along the Ranimahal-Ramdi stretch of the Kaligandaki Corridor in Palpa has been disrupted for the past five months due to multiple landslides.The negligence of the construction company and Kaligandaki corridor road construction project is partly to be blamed for the disruption, say local residents who have been hugely affected by the halt in vehicular movement. “The construction company has not cleared the landslide debris,” said Guna Bahadur Budhathoki of Khanigaun. “There has been no road access to Khanigaun for several months, leaving the villages with a short supply of essentials.”Several landslides have blocked the road stretch from Ranimahal, a historic palace and tourist destination, to Dailatung of Khanigaun. The 18-kilometre Ramdi-Ranimahal road section was opened last year, 10 years after the contract for the project was signed.The Kaligandaki Corridor is one of the national pride projects that connects neighbouring India and China through Nepal. The north-south corridor runs through 132 kilometres of the Argali-Rampur-Gaindakot section, 88 kilometres in the Ridi-Gulmi-Baglung section, 87 kilometres in Baglung-Beni-Jomsom section and 105 kilometres in the Jomsom-Korala section.The people’s representatives say clearing the debris is a mammoth task and one that cannot be initiated at the local level alone. “The local residents are in hardship as the authorities concerned have not cleared the landslide debris from the monsoon season. The local unit does not have the budget to clear the landslides,” said Laxmi Prasad Adhikari, the ward chairman of Yamgha. According to Adhikari, while other sections of the Kaligandaki Corridor have already been upgraded and blacktopped, the Ranimahal-Ramdi stretch is in a sorry state due to the negligence of the road project office and the contractor.Road upgradation work, including blacktopping, is underway in the Gulmi, Baglung, Myagdi, Mustang and Nawalparasi sections of the Kaligandaki Corridor. In Palpa, the upgradation work is currently ongoing in Ridi-Ranimahal and Pipaldanda-Nawalparasi stretches.Himdung and Thokar Construction Company had been awarded the contract to open and upgrade roads along the Dailatung-Ranimahal section eight years ago at the cost of Rs 74 million. “The Ramdi-Ranimahal track was opened last year. But the construction company is yet to complete the upgradation work. We have put pressure on the contractor company to complete the upgradation work at the earliest. The contractor has assured us that it will complete the work within four months,” said Kalpana Adhikari, the chief of the road project.The Lumbini provincial government has also expressed its concern over the delay in the completion of the upgradation work and the disruption of the Ranimahal-Ramdi stretch by landslides. The provincial Minister for Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation Bir Bahadur Rana recently went on a field inspection of the road section and urged the road project to take immediate action to resume vehicular movement along the Ranimahal-Ramdi section.The road project issued a letter to Himdung and Thokar Construction Company, giving it an ultimatum to complete the upgradation work and clear the landslide debris within four months. “We are attempting to get the work done by the contractor at the earliest,” said chief of the road project Kalpana Adhikari.","Published at : November 8, 2021",Palpa,Madhav Aryal
Health insurance encourages Gulmi residents to seek medical care,"Putali Sunar, a 63-year-old Dalit woman from Gulmidurbar Rural Municipality-4, had been living with severe abdomen pain for years but did not have the means to go for a medical check up. Only a month ago did she find out that she was covered by a health insurance programme under the federal government which would cover all her medical expenses. She then visited the district hospital in Gulmi, where she was diagnosed with gallstone. Putali’s gallstones were surgically removed free of cost, relieving the patient of chronic pain and her family members of medical expenses.“We wouldn’t have been able to get the surgery done if we had to bear the cost,” said Laxmi Sunar, Putali’s daughter-in-law, who had accompanied Putali to the district hospital. “The health insurance scheme has come as a great relief to all of our family members.” According to Gopal Prasad Pandey, the chairman of the Gulmi District Hospital Management Committee, the government’s health insurance has covered the check-up and treatment costs of beneficiaries worth around Rs 8 million.“The beneficiaries received X-ray, USG and ECG among other services equivalent to Rs 4.3 million and received free of cost medicines worth Rs 3.6 million,” said Pandey.Women and senior citizens from impoverished families have hugely benefited from health insurance facilities. “I did not save money when I was young and economically active. Now that I don’t have a steady source of income, the health insurance policy has come as a boon,” said Umakala Shrees, a 58-year-old woman from Resunga Municipality-8, who got her health insurance in October last year. “I often fall ill and have to visit the hospital frequently. I have to take medicines that cost a good amount of money. The health insurance covers all these expenses now.” Rupkala Bhusal, 82, of Malarani Rural Municipality-2 in Arghakhanchi district is diabetic and has to visit the district hospital regularly to get her tests done. She too is one of the beneficiaries of the health insurance policy.“I do not have to pay even a single rupee for blood sugar tests after the government issued me a health insurance document. I regularly visit the hospital for tests and treatment now,” she said.Like Putali and Rupkala, many people have started visiting health institutions, as the health insurance policy ensures free check-ups and treatment for its beneficiaries.As per data available at the Gulmi District Hospital, a total of 15,975 people received free health services under the health insurance policy within the first three months of the current fiscal year. According to Dr Suraj Pokharel, the information officer at the hospital, women outnumber men in receiving services under the health insurance programme.The number of people visiting the hospital to receive services under the health insurance policy is increasing, health workers say. According to Pokharel, 10,030 individuals with health insurance facilities visited the district hospital in the first three months of the last fiscal year. Nearly 6,000 more people visited the hospital in the first quarter of the current fiscal year, said Pokharel.Meanwhile in Rolpa, another hill district of Lumbini Province, the health insurance programme has not proven to be effective. Only a negligible number of families in the district have signed up for the health insurance policy, according to Sagar Paudel, the district coordinator of the Health Insurance Board. “Initially, around 7,000 families signed up for the health insurance scheme but only half of them renewed the policy,” said Paudel. “We have requested the people’s representatives to provide necessary support to make the health insurance programme effective in the district but the response has been dismal so far.”","Published at : October 30, 2021",Gulmi,Gaganshila Khadka
"Scrub typhus, dengue cases rise in Lumbini","Cases of scrub typhus and dengue are on the rise in several districts of Lumbini Province. The data at major health institutions in the province show that the number of scrub typhus and dengue cases is increasing at an alarming rate in three hill districts of Lumbini—Palpa, Gulmi and Arghakhanchi. According to Dronacharya Bhusal, the medical record officer at United Mission Hospital in Tansen, as many as 710 fever patients who visited the hospital in the last three months were diagnosed with scrub typhus. “Laboratory tests of 1,847 patients confirmed around 710 scrub typhus cases within this fiscal year,” said Bhusal. According to him, 286 scrub typhus patients were admitted to the hospital for treatment.A total of 403 patients had been diagnosed with scrub typhus, an infectious mite-borne disease that is caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi, in the United Mission Hospital in the fiscal year 2020/21.Likewise, 16 patients of scrub typhus were admitted at Lumbini Medical College, another major health institution in Palpa district, in the first quarter of the current fiscal year.Employees at the District Health Office in Palpa suspect that the number of scrub typhus cases could be even higher in the district. “The number of scrub typhus cases could be higher, as most health institutions keep records of only those who have been admitted at hospitals,” said Narayan Chaudhary, the chief at the health office. According to him, the office does not have the data on all scrub typhus and dengue patients.Scrub typhus cases are on the rise in Butwal-based Lumbini Provincial Hospital as well. According to health workers, most scrub typhus patients are children below 10 years old.Dr Netra Rana, a consultant pediatrician at the hospital, said that around 10 children suffering from fever visit the hospital on a daily basis. Among them, three are diagnosed with scrub typhus.Scrub typhus is transmitted by a mite that feeds on forest and rural rodents, including rats, voles and field mice. Health workers warn all guardians to be vigilant and protect their children from mite bites.According to Dr Sudarshan Thapa, a senior physician at the provincial hospital, some of the symptoms of scrub typhus are fever, headache, muscle pain and diarrhoea, among others. “It is a curable disease. But a patient may die if deprived of timely treatment,” Thapa warned.Similarly, cases of dengue are also on the rise in the province. The United Mission Hospital in Tansen has reported 51 dengue cases in the last three months. The hospital had received just one dengue case in the last fiscal year.“Among 808 people who underwent laboratory tests, 51 tested positive for dengue within this fiscal year. Twenty-two of them were admitted to the hospital. Most of the patients are from Palpa, Gulmi and Arghakhanchi districts,” said Bhusal.Meanwhile, a people’s representative from Palpa died of dengue in Butwal last week. According to the District Health Office in Palpa, 57-year-old Hum Bahadur Sinjali, the ward member of Rambha Rural Municipality-1, died at Gautam Buddha Community Hospital in Butwal in the course of treatment.","Published at : October 24, 2021",Palpa,Madhav Aryal						 &
Major health institutions in Palpa fail to run Safe Motherhood Programme,"The government’s Safe Motherhood Programme has yet to take off in Lumbini, depriving women in the province of free maternal health services.Service seekers, mainly from the impoverished communities, complain that they have to spend large sums of money while visiting Lumbini Medical College and United Mission Hospital—two major health institutions in Palpa district. Kopila Damai of Mujhung in Rainadebi Chhahara Rural Municipality-5 visited Lumbini Medical College last month to give birth to her baby. The Damai family, a poor Dalit family, spent Rs 16,000 at the health institution. “It is a big amount for a poor family like ours. We took a loan from the neighbours to manage the hospital expenses,” said Kopila. Had the Lumbini Medical College implemented the Safe Motherhood Programme, Kopila would have received government-stipulated travel expenses and encouragement allowance, saving her from debt. Under the ‘Safe Motherhood Programme,’ mothers and babies are provided free medical treatment, transportation allowance and cash incentives for antenatal checkups. The federal government launched the programme to encourage pregnant women to visit health centres and hospitals and reduce maternal mortality rate in the country. To encourage women to opt for institutional births and get regular checkups, the government provides transportation allowance and cash incentives. Women in the mountainous, hilly and Tarai regions are provided Rs3,000, Rs2,000 and Rs1,000 respectively. Additionally, a cash bonus of Rs800 is provided to women who complete all four antenatal checkups.But most women, especially from rural areas, in Lumbini do not have the means to avail of such facilities. “There is a birthing centre in the village. But the health workers usually refer pregnant women to well-facilitated hospitals in the city that are better equipped to handle complications,” said Tulsa Somai, a postpartum mother from Rainadebi Chhahara Rural Municipality. “So we have to go to the big hospitals and spend huge amounts of money.” According to her, almost all families in the rural municipality go to Lumbini Medical College or United Mission Hospital for safe delivery in spite of the costs involved.Hospitals, both private and government, in various districts are also yet to implement the Safe Motherhood Programme. In Palpa, Palpa Hospital, Rampur Hospital and some primary health centres and health posts are the only institutions to provide the allowances. But since these health institutions are not fully equipped to handle pregnancy complications, most women are referred to bigger hospitals in the cities. According to the District Health Office, around 5,000 women in Palpa gave birth in the last fiscal year but only 1,000 of them received the allowances. Shir Bahadur Rana, the health unit chief of Tansen Municipality, where Lumbini Medical College and United Mission Hospital are situated, says the local unit has the provision to issue budgets to health institutions for providing delivery service. The amount is issued for normal delivery, caesarean section and other critical surgery. But, according to Rana, the aforementioned two biggest hospitals have not accepted the budget since they do not run the Safe Motherhood Programme. “United Mission Hospital never implemented the Safe Motherhood Programme despite our repeated requests. And Lumbini Medical College decided to discontinue the programme last year,” said Rana. According to him, a budget of Rs21 million under the Safe Motherhood Programme was frozen in the fiscal year 2020/21, as two major health institutions in Tansen Municipality refused to implement the programme.The two major hospitals say the budget issued by the federal government through the local units is not sufficient to run the Safe Motherhood Programme. “Our hospital has not implemented the programme, as the government’s budget is not enough to cover the total expenses. We have to bear a loss while implementing the programme,” said Jiban Bhattara, the manager at United Mission Hospital. The government provides Rs7,000 to each surgery case under the Safe Motherhood Programme. “Our hospital also provides free services to poor families. But not to those who can afford to pay,” said Bhattarai.Krishna Prasad Parajuli, information officer at Lumbini Medical College, says the amount released by the government under the Safe Motherhood Programme does not cover the expenses since most delivery cases referred to the hospital are critical ones where the patients need surgical procedures. “Almost all the patients visiting our hospital are referral cases. Most women are in need of surgery,” said Parajuli. “We have written to the federal health ministry to reconsider the budget under the Safe Motherhood Programme so that the hospital alone does not end up bearing the cost.” The District Health Office in Tansen says the number of pregnant women visiting Lumbini Medical College and United Mission Hospital is around five times more than those visiting public hospitals and other health facilities in the local units. According to Om Prakash Panthi, the information officer at the District Health Office in Tansen, a total of 5,044 women gave birth in the last fiscal year. As many as 2,566 women received maternity and delivery service at United Mission Hospital while 1,471 visited Lumbini Medical College for safe delivery.“As many as 4,037 women were deprived of the Safe Motherhood Programme last year. Major hospitals are unwilling to adopt the programme. The government should enforce its policy and programme strictly,” said Panthi.","Published at : October 13, 2021",Palpa,Madhab Aryal

Four people killed in clash with police in Rupandehi,"Four people died in a violent clash between police and land squatters at the Motipur Industrial Area in Rupandehi district on Sunday. At least a dozen others were injured. According to Sushil Gurung, administration chief at Universal College of Medical Sciences, Bhairahawa four of the 13 injured people brought to the hospital have died while a fifth one is in a critical condition.“Three people were declared dead on arrival while the fourth person died while undergoing treatment,” said Gurung. Five police personnel are also receiving treatment at the health facility.Kamal Pandey, the assistant chief district officer of Rupandehi, also confirmed the death of four protesters. The District Police Office, however, was yet to verify the deaths until late evening. “I am still in the field. I heard that some injured protesters died in the hospital. But we cannot ascertain the deaths without verifying and identifying the deceased,” said Superintendent of Police Manoj KC, the chief at the District Police Office. According to him, at least 15 protesters and 25 security personnel were injured in the clash. The injured are receiving treatment at various hospitals in Butwal and Bhairahawa. The District Administration Office (DAO) in Rupandehi clamped a curfew in Motipur Industrial Corridor Area, which lies at Ward No 17 and 18 of Butwal Sub-metropolitan City, for an indefinite period to avert any untoward incidents. “The curfew, enforced at 4 pm, will remain effective until another notice,” reads the notice issued by the district administration.According to the DAO, the curfew order was enforced from Tinau River in the east, agriculture lands in Hariharpur in the west, Shivanagar Ranigunj settlement in the north and to the industrial corridor in Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City-18 in the south.The government had announced plans to establish an industrial area in Motipur in the fiscal year 2015/16. The following year, a land ownership document for 813 bighas of land [545 hectares approximately] was issued for the construction of the Motipur Industrial Area. But over the past few months, there has been a huge influx of people from outside the district and some of them have started to build their huts on around 200 bighas of land belonging to the proposed industrial area in Ward No 17 and 18 of Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City, according to locals. “There were around 5,000 unfamiliar people in the industrial area when the clash erupted on Sunday,” said Ruk Bahadur Chhetri, a local who witnessed the clash. “Many people from Dang, Rolpa, Rukum, Myagdi and Dhading, among others, have been coming to the area. Buses full of people have come to the Motipur area from Myagdi and Narayangadh.” Santaram Rana, the ward chairman of Butwal-17, also claimed that many people from various districts of Lumbini, Gandaki, Karnali and Bagmati provinces have been attempting to encroach land in the industrial area. “There are less than two percent local people among the encroachers. All the recent squatters are from outside Rupandehi,” he said. The DAO had been deploying security personnel to the industrial area to clear out the alleged encroachers for the past few days. On Sunday morning, the DAO had deployed security personnel in large numbers.DSP Satya Narayan Thapa, spokesperson at the District Police Office, informed that the police had opened fire after a clash ensued between the security personnel and alleged land encroachers.  “Police were compelled to open fire after the protesters attacked them. The protesters were armed with stones and canes,” said Rishiram Tiwari, chief district officer of Rupandehi. “Police have increased their surveillance and are attempting to evict the encroachers,” he said.","Published at : October 11, 2021",Lumbini,"Ghanashyam Gautam						,"
At least four dead following clashes in Rupandehi between landless squatters and police,"Four people died and more than two dozen injured following a clash between police personnel and landless squatters at the under-construction Motipur Industrial Area in Rupandehi district on Sunday.According to Sushil Gurung, Public Relations Officer at the Bhairawaha-based Universal College of Medical Sciences, four of the eight landless squatters who were brought to the hospital for treatment following the incident have died.“Three people were declared brought dead at the hospital while one died during the course of undergoing treatment,” said Gurung.Five police personnel are also receiving treatment at the health facility, according to Gurung.Police administration, however, has not confirmed the incident of deaths.According to the District Police Office, over two dozen people including police personnel have sustained injuries during the clash. Over 50 people involved in the incident are currently receiving treatment at Lumbini Provincial Hospital. “Of them, 15 are in serious condition,” Ram Prasad Aryal, In-charge of the hospital's emergency department, told the Post.Following the deadly clashes during the day, the District Administration Office, Rupandehi issued a curfew order from 4 pm Sunday evening to prevent any untoward incident in view of the rising tensions. According to the District Administration Office, the curfew order will be in place until further notice and will be implemented from Tinau River in the east to agriculture lands in Hariharpur in the west and Shivanagar Ranigunj settlement in the North to the industrial corridor in Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City-18.DSP Satya Narayan Thapa, spokesperson at the District Police Office, informed that the police had opened fire after a clash ensued between the security personnel and alleged land encroachers. The District Administration Office had deployed security personnel in large numbers to the industrial area since early Sunday morning.Eyewitnesses have claimed that shots were fired from both sides during the clash. The government in the fiscal year 2015-16 had announced the construction of the industrial zone. The following year a land ownership document was issued for Motipur Industrial Area to be constructed in 813 bighas of land. As of late, locals from Butwal have constructed around 400 temporary houses and shelters in around 200 bighas of land inside the industrial zone. A prohibitory order was issued by the local administration effective from September 14 inside the industrial area to clear the encroachers.","Published at : October 10, 2021",Lumbini,Sanju Paudel						 &
Hospitals in Krishnanagar Municipality overwhelmed with diarrhoea patients,"On Tuesday morning, seven-year-old Anas Haluwai of Bahadurgunj in Krishnanagar Municipality was taken to Shivaraj Hospital in Kapilvastu after suffering from severe diarrhoea. But there were no beds available. His uncle, Jibrayim Haluwai, had to bring a bed from home to facilitate Anas’s treatment at the hospital.Shivaraj Hospital has been filled beyond capacity since Monday evening, after the residents of wards 7, 8 and 9 of Krishnanagar Municipality started coming to the hospital with complaints of severe diarrhoea.Doctors at the hospital suspect a diarrhoea outbreak in the area, as more than 300 patients have checked in to the hospital since Monday. “Until Wednesday evening, 305 cases of diarrhoea were reported at the hospital,” said Rabi Upadhayay, chief at the Emergency Unit of the hospital The 15-bed hospital is overwhelmed by the surging number of diarrhoea patients in need of hospitalisation. According to the hospital administration, it has been receiving 20 times more patients than its capacity with health workers forced to treat patients on the floor due to bed shortage. “Up to three patients are receiving treatment from a single bed,” said Upadhayay. Over 35 patients are undergoing treatment in the open, say health workers at Shivaraj Hospital. Ten members of a family in Bahadurgunj, Krishnanagar Municipality have taken ill from severe diarrhoea since Monday. “Four of my family members have been admitted to the hospital for treatment. Rest are recuperating at home. We have not consumed anything harmful. I don’t know how the entire village has fallen ill at the same time,” said Bittar Dhobi, whose entire family has fallen ill with diarrhoea.Currently, 165 patients are undergoing treatment at Shivaraj Hospital. By Wednesday evening, 105 were discharged, the data of the hospital administration showed. “We are facing a shortage of human resources and medical equipment,” said Dr Mukesh Chaudhary, acting medical superintendent of the hospital. “We have set up 15 more beds under a tent to accommodate the increasing number of diarrhoea patients.” However, the number of patients has been increasing and the situation has become critical, Chaudhary warned.One hundred and five patients were sent home following treatment from a health camp set up in Mahendra Basic School on Wednesday. As many as 35 critically ill patients were referred to well-facilitated hospitals in Taulihawa, the district headquarters of Kapilvastu, Bhairahawa and Butwal on Tuesday and Wednesday. The patients say they are unaware of the cause behind the diarrhoea outbreak in the local unit. “I am a chronic patient of diabetes and am careful about my food intake. But I don’t know how my daughter and I got sick. Both of us are receiving treatment at Shivaraj Hospital. We feel better now but we still have bouts of vomiting,” said Bhim Bahadur Chhetri of Bahadurgunj.Most of the patients are suffering from diarrhoea, stomach ache, vomiting and infirmities. “The symptoms are similar to that of Kala-azar. But it cannot be ascertained without a laboratory test,” said Hemraj Pandey, chief at the District Health Office. According to him, the samples of five patients from different parts of Krishnanagar have been sent to Butwal for a laboratory test.Pandey said separate health teams from Krishnanagar Municipality, Kapilvastu Hospital and the Provincial Health Directorate have been deployed in the affected areas to provide treatment.“We have deployed enough health workers in the affected area to contain the disease. We are concentrating our efforts to provide timely treatment to the patients,” he said.The outbreak, which is spreading in other areas of the municipality, is a grave health issue, says Krishnanagar Mayor Rajat Pratap Sah. “We have been informed that some people in Krishnanagar, Purushottampur and Shivanagar have also taken ill,” said Sah. According to health workers deployed in the area, most of the affected people are children aged five to eleven and the elderly.Health workers suspect that the disease might have spread through contaminated drinking water. Most of the patients, the health workers say, are from places where the Drinking Water Corporation in Bahadurgunj has recently extended pipelines to supply drinking water.Meanwhile, some health workers at Shivaraj Hospital have also been taken ill with diarrhoea, the hospital administration said.","Published at : October 7, 2021",Kapilvastu,Manoj Paudel
Men in Lumbini reluctant to adopt permanent family planning measures,"In the last fiscal year, the government set up permanent family planning camps four times in Kapilvastu district of Lumbini Province. The camps were organised for both men and women but the participation of men was significantly low.According to the record of the provincial Ministry of Health, Population and Family Welfare, a total of 113 women adopted family planning measures in Kapilvastu through the family planning camps in the last fiscal year. Correspondingly, there was only one man who opted for permanent family planning measures in the district in the same time frame.Health officials in the province say that men are not keen on adopting family planning measures such as vasectomy and permanent sterilisation, and expect women to go through a minilap procedure wherein the fallopian tubes are occluded to avoid conception. “Even the man who came for a vasectomy agreed to the procedure because his wife had health issues with a prolapsed uterus,” Dr Binod Giri, director of the Lumbini Health Directorate, told the Post. Thirty-five-year-old Janaki Pasi of Mayadevi Rural Municipality-2 in Rupandehi and her husband Jog Raj Pasi, 37, have three children—two sons and a daughter. Janaki, who is an asthma patient, had persistently urged her husband to get a vasectomy after the birth of their second child. But her husband refused.Janaki conceived her fourth child last year but her health did not allow her a full-term pregnancy. She aborted her two-month fetus and underwent a minilap in Butwal. “I am not in the best of health so I had requested my husband to get a vasectomy but he refused. So I decided to undergo permanent sterilisation since I can’t keep having babies,” Janaki told the Post.Jog Raj, who had accompanied his wife Janaki when she decided to abort the fetus and undergo permanent sterilisation, said he did not want vasectomy because of the social stigma attached to it. “All the men in our village are virile. I could not have become the only man incapable of fathering children. My friends and neighbours would think poorly of me,” said Jog Raj. Out of 1,724 individuals who adopted permanent family planning measures in Lumbini Province in the last fiscal year, 1,489 were women while only 235 men underwent vasectomies, according to the data of the Ministry of Health Population and Family Welfare. In Nawalparasi (West), 489 individuals adopted permanent family planning measures in the last fiscal year. Among them, only nine were men.In Rupandehi, 144 women underwent minilap and 13 men underwent vasectomy last year whereas 344 women underwent minilap and 15 men underwent vasectomy in Bardiya. In Dang, the number of women who underwent minilap in the last fiscal year was 96 while only nine men underwent vasectomy. Similarly, 62 women underwent minilap and 13 men underwent vasectomy in Pyuthan last year. Giri from Lumbini Health Directorate said that the health authorities and health workers have been unable to convince men to adopt permanent family planning measures, as most of them feel their manhood would be questioned if they undergo such procedures. “Aside from the fear of social ostracism, men think they would be deprived of sexual pleasure if they undergo vasectomy,” said Giri. “This line of thought has greatly affected our efforts in sensitising men to the importance of family planning and making them understand that it’s not only the women’s responsibility to adopt family planning measures.”However, the ignorance in men in regards to permanent family planning measures is not limited to Lumbini Province, says Giri. “All men, whether in the Tarai plains or the hill districts, are hesitant to adopt permanent family planning measures, and they turn towards women to take care of things in case of unwanted pregnancies,” he said.According to the data of the Department of Health Services, a total of 1,001,806 women across the nation underwent minilap in the last fiscal year 2020/21 while the number of men who underwent vasectomy during the same year is just 316,267.The Provincial Ministry of Health, Population and Family Welfare launched an interaction and counselling programme in Lumbini Province in the last fiscal year since the participation of men in family planning camps was very low.Health workers informed both men and women that there are no side effects to vasectomy and minilap and that they would be able to live a normal life even after the procedures. But the men were still reluctant, says Neha Thapa, a nursing officer at the provincial ministry.“Vasectomy is comparatively easier to perform than the permanent sterilisation carried out on women. Vasectomy is reversible but minilap is not. Even with the facts and case studies presented to men, only a few of them came forward for the procedure,” said Thapa.","Published at : October 6, 2021",Butwal,Amrita Anmol
Flow of returnees increases but testing goes down,"On September 30, a group of five migrant workers reached Jamunaha border point in Nepalgunj from India, seeking entry into Nepal. The health workers deployed at the border point ran antigen tests on them. One of the returnees tested positive for Covid-19 but the group was still allowed to enter Nepalgunj.Health workers deployed at the border points in Lumbini Province run antigen tests on Covid-19 suspects and those with no proof of vaccination but there are no restrictions on those testing positive for Covid-19. Like the youth who tested positive on September 30, most walk across the border and into busy markets without adopting any health safety measures, said one of the security personnel deployed at the Jamunaha border point in Banke district. Every day, 1,500 to 2,000 migrant workers from India are entering Nepal from the border point, according to the record kept by the security personnel at the border. The sheer volume of people entering Nepal through the border point has made it difficult to run tests on each individual crossing the border, says Chiranjibi Gyawali, a health worker deployed at the health desk in Jamunaha. “We provide consultations to the infected and send them home with suggestions to stay in isolation. It is not possible to test everyone. We run tests only on those suspected of having Covid-19,” Gyawali told the Post. Until August 26, the Nepal Red Cross Society had deployed ambulances to carry Covid-19-infected individuals to their respective districts from the border point.“But the agreement between the Red Cross and the District Covid-19 Management Centre has ended. These days, Covid-19-infected individuals are free to go home without any restrictions,” said Gyawali, adding that he has been informing the concerned stakeholders about the situation but to no avail.At the Krishnanagar border point in Kapilvastu, 300 people cross into Nepal every day, according to the data kept by security personnel at the border.Mayor of Krishnanagar Municipality in Kapilvastu Rajat Pratap Shah says the health desk at the border point operates from 8am to 6pm every day. “Health workers at the desk take the body temperatures of returnees and inquire about their health condition. They also run antigen tests on Covid-19 suspects. Then the returnees are free to enter Nepal,” he said. “There are no quarantine measures for returnees who could be possible carriers of the virus.” According to him, the municipality will soon start deploying health workers to the border point on night shifts.In Rupandehi, the District Health Office is preparing to expand antigen testing at Sunauli border point. Dr Rajendra Giri, chief at the District Health Office in Rupandehi, says his office is planning to expand testing at the border since the flow of returnees for the upcoming festive season has increased in recent days. Until a few weeks ago, as many as 160 antigen tests were being conducted on people entering Nepal through the border point but now the number has dwindled to 50 despite the increasing flow of returnees.The isolation facilities set up near the Sunauli border are almost empty.According to Rishiram Tiwari, the chief district officer of Rupandehi, the returnees who test positive for Covid-19 are sent to their destinations in coordination with the respective local units. “We have a vehicle on standby near the border point. With the assistance of the Nepal Red Cross Society, we send Covid-19-infected returnees to their homes in the vehicle,” said Tiwari.According to the District Health Office in Rupandehi, out of 576 people who underwent antigen testing at the Sunauli-Belahiya border point, only two tested positive for Covid-19 in the past week. Krishna Prasad Aryal, the inspector at the Armed Police Force border outpost in Danda, said that while it is mandatory for foreigners seeking to enter Nepal to furnish a Polymerase Chain Reaction test report, it is not the case for Nepali returnees.Meanwhile, in Kanchanpur, the isolation facility set up at the Community Health Institute in Mahendranagar is still in operation. Returnees entering Nepal through the Gaddachauki border point are sent directly to the isolation facility if they test positive for Covid-19. Currently, 11 people are staying at the facility.According to the District Health Office in Kanchanpur, an ambulance of the Mahakali Provincial Hospital is being used to carry the infected people from Gaddachauki border point to the isolation facility. “Some of the infected go home after staying at the isolation facility for 14 days while others who prefer home isolation are sent home on the recommendation of the concerned local unit,” said Siddaraj Bhatta, the public health inspector at the health office. Of late, the number of people returning home from India is on the rise, as Dashain, a major Hindu festival, is round the corner. According to the security personnel deployed at Gaddachauki border area, around 700 people enter Nepal through the border point on a daily basis. A total of 788 people entered Nepal through Gaddachauki on Saturday. Health workers conducted antigen testing of 756 people; of them, one tested positive. Similarly, a total of 424 people entered Nepal through the Gauriphanta border point in Kailali district on Saturday. The health workers conducted antigen tests on 225 people. No one tested positive. On the other hand, an isolation centre has been set up at Urma in Dhangadhi Sub-Metropolitan City-15 for the returnees infected with Covid-19. According to Dinesh Thakulla, in-charge at the health desk set up at Gauriphanta border point, out of 1,000 people who underwent antigen testing in the past week, not a single person tested positive for Covid-19.“More than 500 people cross the border point on a daily basis. We are unable to conduct testing on all returnees due to a lack of manpower and other resources,” said Thakulla.(With inputs from Bhawani Bhatta in Kanchanpur, Mohan Budhaair in Kailali, Manoj Paudel in Kapilvastu and Madhav Dhungana in Bhairahawa.)","Published at : October 4, 2021",Nepalgunj,Rupa Gahatraj
Government policies fail to reduce infant mortality rate in Palpa,"Various plans and policies aimed at reducing infant mortality rate in Palpa have failed to bear results with the number of infant deaths this fiscal year surpassing that of preceding years. In the fiscal year 2020-21, 22 infants in the district died within 28 days of their birth. According to the data of the District Health Office, 4,601 children were born in the fiscal year 2020-21. In the fiscal year 2019-20, out of 5,322 new births, 11 infants died within 28 days while nine out of 5,637 infants died within 28 days in the fiscal year 2018-19, the record of the District Health Office showed.According to the District Health Office in Palpa, the number of infantile deaths has increased across the district in the last four years despite several programmes implemented at the local and district levels to save mothers and babies.The government has been running the Suaahara Programme, one of the initiatives of the federal government that aims to improve the health and nutritional status of women and children to lower maternal and infant deaths, in Palpa for the last six years. The programme spends Rs 10 to 15 million every year for safe motherhood and infant care. Postpartum women and their newborns get nutritious food among other things for 1,000 days after delivery under the programme. However, such efforts have not been effective mostly because the budget allocated for the government programmes have not been utilised properly, according to Chitrabali Ram Suwal, a civil society leader in Tansen, the district headquarters of Palpa. “Every year, the District Health Office in Palpa and other organisations spend millions on safe motherhood and child care programmes. But the allocated budget is misused,” said Suwal. “The budget is allocated to reduce maternal and infant deaths, eliminate malnutrition and increase food security and nutrition level in both mothers and their children. But the ones responsible for the implementation of the programmes use the money on conducting inspections, training, seminars and on allowances, which do not benefit the target group.” Om Prakash Panthi, information officer at the District Health Office in Palpa, agrees that the programmes have failed to bear results in the district.“The number of infantile deaths has been increasing in Palpa over the years. This brings the effectiveness of various programmes introduced to reduce infant mortality rate and boost maternal health into question,” Panthi said.According to him, the District Health Office spent over Rs 3 million last year on providing training on safe motherhood to health workers at local health posts and hospitals. “We are conducting various programmes to curb infant mortality rate and promote safe motherhood and child care,” said Panthi. “The training and workshops were conducted to educate health workers on safe motherhood policies but the effort failed to show results at the grassroots level.”Bishnumaya Gaha, a health volunteer of Phek in Ribdikot Rural Municipality, believes that if the country is to achieve success in eliminating infant and maternal mortality rate, it must first eradicate child marriages which are still prevalent in the rural areas.“One of the contributing factors to the rising infant mortality rate in Palpa is the authorities’ failure to stem child marriages, especially in the rural parts of the district,” said Gaha. “Child marriages are still prevalent in the district. When teenagers become mothers, it affects the overall health of the mother and her newborn.” According to her, rather than conducting training and seminars for the health workers, the authorities should launch awareness programmes at the local level that will reach people’s doorsteps. “If infant mortality rate is to be improved, it is imperative to sensitise the local people about the repercussions of child marriage and its long-lasting impact on the mother and the child’s health,” said Gaha.Sunil Adhikari, chief at the Health Unit of Ribdikot Rural Municipality, says children of teenage mothers die within a few days of their birth. “The health condition of mothers also gets worse after delivery. That’s why awareness programmes should be launched at the community level to save both mothers and children,” Adhikari said. Purbakhola Rural Municipality says it has been taking active steps towards reducing maternal and infant mortality rate by conducting regular health check-ups of pregnant and postpartum women as well as infants, according to Mohan Dhakal, chief at the Health Unit of the rural municipality.According to the National Demographic Health Survey of 2016, of every 1,000 live births, 21 babies die within a month in Nepal. The survey also shows that for every 100,000 births, 229 women die during or after childbirth. Nepal had previously reduced the maternal mortality rate from 539 in 1996 to 239 in 2016—for which the country received the Millennium Development Goal award.","Published at : September 27, 2021",Palpa,Madhab Aryal
Gabhar residents in Banke terrorised by tiger attacks,"The residents of Gabhar settlement in Raptisonari Rural Municipality-1, Banke, have been living in abject terror for the past few days as tigers from Banke National Park have started entering human settlements.On September 12, a 45-year-old man of Gabhar was attacked and dragged into a nearby forest by a tiger. His body was recovered the next day.The same day, a tiger pounced on a cow grazing on the premises of a local community school in Gabhar. The tiger was chased away by the villagers.“The residents of Gabhar, Kusuma and Sauri among other settlements near the national park forest are terrified. The concerned authorities have not taken any concrete initiatives to protect the settlements from tiger attacks,” said Chandra Bahadur Oli, the chairman of Raptaisonari Ward 1.The settlement of Gabhar is around 100 metres from the Agaiya-Kusum road along the East-West Highway. The local residents, who have long since suffered from tiger menace, demand that the authorities concerned take necessary steps to protect the settlements from wildlife attacks.Last week, 37-year-old Kaushila Khatri of Gabhar had gone to a nearby forest to graze her cattle when a tiger attacked one of her goats. She escaped the site but has been terror-stricken ever since. Khatri hasn’t left her house since the incident, locals say.According to chairman Oli, tigers are seen roaming around the highway, leaving the local residents in a state of anxiety. A tiger attempted to pounce on a moving motorcycle in the area on Tuesday, he added. Kaishila Khatri, 37, of Gabhar, says children in the area are frightened to step out of their houses due to fear of tiger attacks. “We have been requesting the park administration to take the necessary initiatives to prevent tigers from entering human settlements. But the concerned authority does not pay heed to us. Security personnel arrive in our village only when people die in wildlife attacks,” said Khatri. Three days after the September 12 tiger incident, the Banke National Park took initiatives to take control over a man-eating tiger. “On Wednesday, two elephants were mobilised to search for the tiger. We have also set a trap and installed sensor cameras in two different places to monitor the tiger’s movement,” said Shyam Kumar Sah, chief conservation officer of Banke National Park. “Nepal Army personnel have also been mobilised to provide security in nearby settlements.”According to the data of the national park, the park is home to 21 tigers as per the recent census. Until now, three people have been killed in separate incidents of tiger attack in the area. “The haphazard construction of settlements near forest areas has given rise to human-wildlife conflict. The local population should move their settlements from the forest areas to avoid such incidents,” Sah said. Dhani Kumari Khatri, vice chairperson of Rapti Sonari Rural Municipality, agrees with Sah. He says forest encroachment is one of the main reasons behind the rising incidents of human-wildlife conflict.“We are discussing with the concerned stakeholders to shift settlements near forest areas to safer locations. This is the only way we can minimise human-wildlife conflict,” Khatri said.","Published at : September 22, 2021",Kathmandu,Madhu Shahi

Dakhakwadi residents struggle to keep sandalwood smugglers at bay,"Local farmers of Dakhakwadi in Pyuthan Municipality-1 are having a tough time protecting their sandalwood trees from smugglers.“Smugglers enter the sandalwood grove at night to steal the trees,” said Gobinda Pokharel of Dakhakwadi. Two of his sandalwood trees, approximately 35 years old, were stolen from his field on August 6 and August 9 respectively. “I took great care of those trees over the years. These trees are our only source of income and we haven’t been able to save them from being stolen.” Pokharel has around 10 sandalwood trees in his field, which is around two kilometres from his house. “My field is near the forest. It’s not possible for us to guard the field throughout the night,” he said. “We have asked the local authorities to look into the matter and provide security in the area to control theft.” According to him, he has incurred a loss of approximately Rs 150,000 after two of his sandalwood trees were stolen. Dakhakwadi is considered a pocket area of sandalwood groves. There are around 150 households and each household has 10-12 sandalwood trees on average. According to the local people, more than a dozen sandalwood trees were stolen from the area in the past six months.“Thieves cut down our trees and take away precious wood at night. If this continues, there won’t be any sandalwood trees left in the village,” said Narayan Dhami of Dakhakwadi. He also recently lost his 30-year-old sandalwood tree to smugglers.According to Dhami, the local people have filed complaints at the District Police Office and the Division Forest Office about the theft on numerous occasions but neither of the offices has so far taken any concrete initiatives to address their issue. “We have filed complaints at the Division Forest Office to find the culprits involved in this illegal trade. We have also requested the authority to secure our trees,” Dhami told the Post.In February this year, 15 sandalwood trees were stolen from the fields of Dakhakwadi in a single night. According to local residents, the stolen sandalwood trees were worth Rs 1 million market value. Currently, sandalwood is priced at Rs 7,000 per kilo in the market. The last reported theft of sandalwood trees in Dakhakwadi was seven to eight years ago, say local residents. Since then, there had been no such incident until February. Incidents of sandalwood tree theft have become a regular occurrence now. “We don’t know who the smugglers are since they’ve never been caught,” said Gir Bahadur Dhami, a resident of Dakhakwadi. “The smugglers made away with two of my sandalwood trees in February.”With no means to stop the trees from being stolen, Dakhakwadi residents have started cutting down premature trees in order to sell them for whatever little profit they can make. Sandalwood trees can be felled only after taking permission from the Division Forest Office in Pyuthan. A few months ago, the Division Forest Office arrested three individuals on the charge of smuggling red sandalwoods from the district. Deepak KC, assistant forest officer at the Division Forest Office in Pyuthan, said, “None of the individuals had received permission to cut down sandalwood trees in Pyuthan. However, 172.93 kilograms of illegal sandalwood have been seized from various parts of the district.”","Published at : August 31, 2021",Pyuthan,Shamsher Bikram GC

In the fiscal year 2020, the Division Road Office in Pyuthan had extended the deadline by six months, as the road construction was left incomplete. The extended deadline was over in October last year but the project is nowhere near completion. “The contractor is yet to complete the road project despite our repeated requests,” said Hemanta Roka, an engineer at the division office. He said the office would take action against the contractor soon.Jaljala, a religious and a tourist destination in the region, attracts a large number of people from Rolpa and neighbouring districts every year. Visitors to Jaljala have been greatly affected due to the delay in the road project’s completion. The local people are hopeful that the completion of the project will promote tourism in the region.Man Bahadur Khatri, chairman of the Contractors’ Association of Rolpa who is also the ward chairman of Rolpa Municipality-10, said that the construction of the Liwang-Jaljala road had been delayed, as the main contractor assigned petty contractors to construct the road. “The road project could not be completed on time because the main contractor hired petty contractors for the construction work. The people’s representatives and the local residents have pressured the contractor time and again to complete the work but to no avail,” said Khatri.Rautaha/Harihari JV Construction Company, the contractor company, handed over the responsibility of the road construction to three contractors—Dambar Batha, Lal Bahadur Gharti Magar and Tul Bahadur Khadka, according to Hari Raut, a representative of Rautaha/Harihari JV Construction Company. “Tul Bahadur Khadka was later replaced by Khatak Bahadur Khatri as one of the petty contractors,” Raut said.Meanwhile, the petty contractors involved in the project claimed that around 80 percent work on the road has already been completed. The dispute between the main contractor and petty contractors has also contributed to the delay in the road project, they say. “Around 28 kilometres of the road have already been constructed. We could complete all 35 kilometres if the construction company provided us with funds on time as per the agreement. The company is yet to provide us Rs 9.5 million amount,” said Khatak Bahadur Khatri, one of the petty contractors.Besides complaints about the delay in the project’s completion, the local residents have also started questioning the quality of the road. “The road has not been constructed as per the project agreement. The authorities concerned should monitor the construction work and take steps accordingly,” said Man Bahadur Khatri, chairman of the Contractors’ Association of Rolpa.According to Chief District Officer Nabaraj Sapkota, some local residents have filed complaints at the district administration office about the delay in the project’s completion and the inferior quality of the Liwang-Jaljala road. “We have been requested to check whether the road has been constructed as per the agreement or not. We will soon start monitoring the road project,” said Sapkota.","Published at : August 29, 2021",Rolpa,Kashi Ram Dangi

Multiple landslides leave Pyuthan’s Damri at high risk,"Ker Bahadur Thapa of Damri has been restless after a massive landslide erupted just below his house in Naubahini Rural Municipality-5, Pyuthan, on Wednesday. His house has developed cracks and can collapse any moment now. All five members of his family are taking shelter in an animal shed nearby.“It rains almost every day. The threat of landslides is very high. We are terrified that our house will be swept away,” said Thapa. According to him, the landslide swept away around 20 ropanis of his land. “We cannot return home due to fear of landslides and my land is gone. Where should I go now?”Besides Thapa’s house, around 70 other houses of six settlements in the Damri area are at risk of landslides. Daljita Gharti, a resident of Damri, left her house after a landslide erupted in the area on Wednesday. Her family is taking shelter at a relative’s house in the neighbouring settlement. “We are taking refuge at a relative’s house. We don’t know when the landslides will sweep our house away,” said Gharti. “We have land plots in Patlekhola and Pokhara. But these places are also at risk of landslides. The government should relocate us to safer locations.”Man Bahadur Pun, another local resident, says all the residents of Damri have been affected by the landslides. “There’s no safe location around our village. The school building is also at risk of landslides. And there’s no one to take help from,” Pun said, urging the government authorities to relocate the at-risk settlements to safer places.Around half a dozen villages, including Thulodamri, Sanodamri and Basel, at Damri in Naubahini Rural Municipality Ward No. 5 are at risk of landslides. According to Pun, a dozen families have already fled their village fearing landslides. The landslides have also disrupted electricity supply and drinking water pipelines in Damri. Taj Bahadur Pun, a resident of Damri, says the villagers are without electricity and drinking water for the past few days. “On top of the risk of being swept away, we have to live without electricity and drinking water. We are yet to receive help from the authorities. We have been left in a lurch,” he said.Meanwhile, Ana Bahadur Ghartimagar, chairman of Ward No. 5 of Naubahini Rural Municipality, has underscored the need to relocate 70 households in Damri that are at risk of landslides.“It would cause great destruction if the relocation process is delayed, as the Damri area has been witnessing continuous rainfall for several days,” Ghartimagar said.According to him, the ward office has been collecting details of the destruction and information on the affected families. “We have also requested the rural municipal office for the families’ relocation and distribution of relief,” said Ghartimagar.The residents of Dumri have also been asked to stay on high alert, says Shivaraj Rijal, chairman of Naubahini Rural Municipality.“The rural municipality is yet to receive the details of the destruction.

People returning to India despite Covid-19 risks,"Mohan Thapa had returned home to Surkhet in the second week of April after most Indian cities went into lockdown due to a surge in Covid-19 cases. The situation was the same when Thapa reached Nepal. So he remained confined in his home for several months. There was no work to be found but he had to meet his household expenses which he managed by taking a loan from neighbours. With no prospects of income and mounting debt, Thapa decided to return to India although the risk of Covid-19 has still not subsided there.“I stayed in the village for months but I could not find work. I had to borrow money to take care of my expenses. I can’t live on borrowed money for long so I decided to head back to India in search of jobs,” said the 40-year-old, who had reached Jamunaha border point in Banke on his way to India on Thursday. Thapa was accompanied by five of his friends.Like Thapa and his friends, a large number of migrant workers from Lumbini, Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces have started returning to India in search of jobs. Hundreds of people, mostly youths, enter India through Jumunaha crossing on a daily basis, according to the border police.Purna Khatri, sub-inspector of Area Police Office, Jamunaha, said around 500 to 600 individuals are entering India on a daily basis. “Most of the people are headed to New Delhi, Chandigarh, Gujarat, and Mumbai. They had returned to Nepal some three to four months ago,” Khatri said.Ramesh Dhamala of Banke also returned to India after seeing that there were no employment opportunities at home.“I wanted to stay home during the pandemic. But I have no alternative but to go to India for work,” said Dhamala. “Our government did nothing for people like us. They have left us to fend for ourselves.”Most of the India-bound migrant workers said they were compelled to go to India because there were no job opportunities in Nepal.Jasabir Budha of Dailekh had returned from India in mid-April. He tried to find a job in his home district for months without avail. “I am going to India again for a job because I could not find one in my own country,” he said. A majority of the young population in the hill districts of Lumbini and Karnali provinces go to various Indian cities every year in search of jobs. The movement of people along Jamunaha border has also increased due to the local people of Banke who visit Rupaidiha Bazar for their daily shopping. “The government has not opened the borders officially yet. However, the Jamunaha border is open only for daily shopping,” said Khatri, the sub-inspector at Area Police Office, Jamunaha.Dirgharaj Upadhayay, assistant chief District officer of Banke, said, “The cross-border movement of people at Jamunaha crossing has been relaxed considering the daily needs of the local residents. We have not received an official letter from the government to open the border point.”According to the District Administration Office in Banke, Indian nationals, Nepali workers and employees are allowed to enter into Nepali territory only after conducting health checkups.","Published at : August 21, 2021",Nepalgunj,Rupa Gahatraj
Timber worth millions missing from Kapilvastu community forest,"Over 900 cubic feet of timber logs have been missing from the Shringighat Community Forest area in Banganga Municipality since the last two weeks.Shringighat Community Forest, which covers wards 1, 3, 4 and 5 of Banganga Municipality, is one of the largest community forests in Kapilvastu district.Initially, information about the missing logs was kept hidden by the community forest consumer committee. The incident came to light only after some forest employees disclosed the information.A team of technicians from Motipur Sub Division Forest Office found 939.44 cubic feet of logs missing while tallying the wood cutting records in the field. The record shows that 882 cubic feet of sal logs and 56 cubic feet of Asana, Karman and Kusum logs are missing from the field depot. Those logs were stamped and registered, said forest officials.On March 6, 2020, the Division Forest Office in Kapilvastu had granted permission to the Shringighat Community Forest Consumers Group to cut down 27,508 cubic feet of wood from the community forest.Krishna Gopal Koju and Ganesh Bahadur Singh Thakuri, forest consumers of Banganga Ward No. 4, had received a contract to transport, unload, collect and pile timber at the field depot. On May 28, 2020, the then government ordered forest offices to keep the logs inside the forest until further notice. Then after, works related to transportation and measurement of woods came to a halt.On January 27, the government scrapped the decision and contractors started to transport logs that were cut and recorded from the forest areas to the field depots.Since June, timber logs from the Shringighat Community Forest have been brought to the field depot in Madhuban Dham, a part of Shringighat Community Forest around six kilometres from the northern part of Pawar Community Forest in Arghakhanchi. Forest technicians had then conducted a field measurement of the logs at the field depot.“The timber logs were found missing when the technicians were measuring logs at the field depot,” said Umesh Kumar Shah, assistant forest officer of Motipur Sub Division Forest Office. “The logs might have gone missing while they were being transported to the field depot or inside the forest.”The community forest users’ committee is responsible for managing timber in the forest. However, office bearers of the users’ committee and the individuals responsible for managing timber remained tight-lipped about the stolen timber. After information about the missing logs came to light, the division forest office instructed the forest users’ committee to form a probe committee and investigate the case. A five-member committee headed by Krishna Paudel, the secretary of the forest users’ committee, was formed as per the direction of the forest office. The committee submitted its preliminary report a few days ago stating that logs were stolen from the community forest. But the report does not mention how and from where the logs were stolen. And the report does not state who is responsible for the incident.The forest consumers suspect that the probe committee prepared such an incomplete report to protect the guilty. “The report does not show who was responsible for the missing timber. The case of timber theft will continue unless the guilty are punished,” said a consumer preferring anonymity.As per the valuation of the community forest users’ committee, the stolen logs cost around Rs 700,000 based on its minimum rate fixed while selling the timber to consumers. However, its market price is more than three fold. The community forest users’ committee claims that incidents of timber theft are rife in the district since the government imposed a ban on the collection, transportation and sale of timber from the community forest. Meanwhile, Renu Sen, the chairperson of the community forest consumers’ committee, said, “The contractors who were given responsibility for logging could not complete their work on time. The government later banned the logging and transportation of timber in the community forest. Since the forest guards provide security in the forest area during day time, the timber could have been stolen at night.”","Published at : August 16, 2021",Kapilvastu,Manoj Paudel

Covid-19 spreads in hill districts of Lumbini Province,"Authorities have begun tightening prohibitory orders in various hill districts of Lumbini Province after the region reported a rise in coronavirus cases in the last few days.The district administrations in Arghakhanchi and Gulmi, where the active number of coronavirus cases stand at 757 and 486 respectively, have banned the operation of public vehicles since July 31 to curb the further spread of the virus.The first and second waves of the coronavirus had greatly affected several Tarai districts, including Banke, Dang, Rupandehi and Kapilvastu. The hill districts in comparison were less affected.But the spread of the virus in Arghakhanchi, Gulmi, Palpa, Pyuthan and Rolpa districts indicate the onslaught of coronavirus in these hill districts, say health workers.Health workers say complacency among the general public and the authorities towards the virus is one of the main causes of the virus spreading in these districts. “People do not follow health security protocol. The virus is spreading due to the utter negligence of the people and that of the local administration,” said Pushkal Shreshta, the coronavirus focal person at the district health office in Pyuthan. “The prohibitory orders were relaxed too soon.” As Pyuthan, Palpa and Rolpa report a rise in Covid-19 cases in the past few days, the respective district authorities have restricted mass assemblies and gatherings. “Restrictions should be back in place because the situation is out of hand. People have stopped wearing masks and following health safety protocols,” said Padam Subedi, a local of Ratamata in Pyuthan Municipality-3. Although coronavirus cases are increasing in Arghakhanchi as well, neither its health institutions nor the local units are prepared to tackle the possible third wave of the pandemic.The district hospitals in Arghakhanchi and Gulmi are ill-equipped with no ventilator service to handle serious coronavirus cases. They have to refer seriously ill patients to Butwal or Kathmandu for treatment.In Rolpa, the district health office has intensified mass testing after Covid-19 cases were reported in remote rural municipalities like Thawang, Sunchhahari and Paribartan. “There were some cases reported from the villages of these rural municipalities so we are conducting as many tests as possible to identify and isolate the infected,” said Nokharaj Pokharel, the chief at the district health office in Rolpa. “The villagers are reluctant to undergo tests for coronavirus for fear of the disease. We are trying our best to convince them to get tested.”The district currently has 60 active cases.Similarly, Dr Sabu Kafle, acting chief at Rolpa Hospital, said the number of Covid-19-infected people has increased in the district of late. “Many people from the district headquarters with symptoms similar to that of Covid-19 have started visiting the hospital for PCR testing. But testing in the rural areas is still negligible,” she said. Palpa, another hill district in Lumbini Province, is also not prepared to handle the possible third wave of the pandemic. Palpa Hospital, Rampur Hospital and other health institutions are still struggling to manage oxygen and enhance health services for critically ill patients. The federal government had released an Rs 8 million budget to set up five High Dependency Unit (HDU) beds and another Rs 7.5 million to install an oxygen plant in Rampur Hospital. But the hospital has yet to install the oxygen plant and set up the HDU beds.“Work is on to install the plant and set up HDU beds soon,” said Dr Bijay Pariyar, the acting medical superintendent at the hospital.(Shumsher Bikram GC in Pyuthan, Madhav Aryal in Palpa and Kashiram Dangi in Rolpa contributed reporting.)","Published at : August 9, 2021",Arghakhanchi,Birendra KC
Embankment work halted due to shortage of stones,"The construction of embankments along the Karnali river near high-risk areas has come to a halt owing to the shortage of raw materials.Rani Jamara Kulariya Irrigation Project is responsible for building embankments along the Karnali river to prevent soil erosion and mitigate the risk of floods and landslides. However, the project office has been unable to collect stones from Lamkichuha Municipality and Mohanyal Rural Municipality since mid-June, and this has led to the halt of the embankment project. According to the project office, the Karnali river has been continuously eroding its riverbanks in Bhurak Khani, Shiva Shakti forest, Sankatti, Daulatpur, Sahipur Village, Satti Karnali Community Forest and Arunaphant.“The rain-swollen river can enter the villages any time now if we fail to build an embankment immediately,” said Bidur Shrestha, senior divisional engineer at the project. According to officials at the Rani Jamara Kulariya Irrigation Project, around 40,000 cubic metres of large stones are needed for the construction of embankments every year. “We need at least 9,000 cubic metres of stones to build embankments during the monsoon season only,” said Shrestha.However, none of the authorities are making efforts to stop the ongoing erosion. “It’s not only the responsibility of the Rani Jamara Kulariya Irrigation Project to control erosion. Other stakeholders should also take initiatives to manage essential construction materials to build embankments,” said Shrestha.On July 18, the District Administration Office in Kailali had written a letter to the respective local units to make available stones for building embankments. “But Lamkichuha Municipality and Mohanyal Rural Municipality did not pay heed to our request,” said Shrestha.Meanwhile, Acting Chairperson of Mohanyal Rural Municipality Puja Budhamagar says that his office is soon going to hold a meeting to decide whether to provide stones for building embankments or not. According to the project office, the construction of an embankment is underway along a 40-kilometre stretch. The Karnali, a major river system of the country, erodes its embankments every year, putting several settlements and cultivable land at risk of floods and inundation. To address the problem, Rani Jamara Kulariya Irrigation Project is constructing embankments along the river from Chisapani to the Nepal-India border.The project’s initiative to construct an embankment has helped mitigate the risk of floods in the area, local residents say.“We are hopeful that the embankment constructed by the irrigation project will protect our settlements and fields,” said Bhim BK, a resident of Tikapur Municipality-7 in Kailali district.Several families in the eastern region of Kailali district have been displaced by floods and inundation. In the past, families living near the Karnali and Mohana rivers used to leave their settlements and move to safer locations every monsoon. But with the construction of embankments by the irrigation project, the families are hopeful that they won’t have to relocate. “The floods used to displace many families in the past. We hope the embankment project will avert such disasters from now onwards,” said Lalbir Chaudhary, the chairman of Jamara Irrigation Canal Consumers' Committee.","Published at : July 27, 2021",Tikapur,Ganesh Chaudhary
Lumbini reports rise in viral fever cases,"Daya Laxmi Sharma of Omsatiya Rural Municipality-2 in Rupandehi district had been suffering from fever since Friday evening. She had worked in the field all day and thought exhaustion might have given her a fever. But her fever got worse through the night and she was taken to a Bhairahawa-based hospital the next morning. Doctors at the hospital said she was suffering from a viral infection. “A blood test at the hospital confirmed viral infection. We brought her home the same day,” said Pratik Sharma, the son. “But her health worsened in the evening so we took her back to the hospital.”Two other family members, according to Pratik, are also suffering from viral fever. Hospitals in Lumbini Province have been reporting an increase in the number of patients suffering from viral fever in the last week.Prithvi Pandey of Butwal-12 has been suffering from a common cold and fever for the past four days. He bought medicines for the same from a local pharmacy since he deems hospitals unsafe from coronavirus infection.“I am taking medicines for fever and cold. I will visit a hospital if I don’t feel better in the next few days,” he said. “My mother and sister-in-law were also suffering from similar illness a few days ago but they got better with medicines from the pharmacy.” According to Dr Sudarshan Thapa, a consultant physician at the Lumbini Provincial Hospital, around 50 patients suffering from viral fever have been visiting the hospital on a daily basis for the past few days. “There is a steady rise in the number of coronavirus patients too. Now the hospital is also getting overwhelmed with patients of viral fever,” Thapa told the Post.Given the ongoing situation, Thapa advises patients of viral infection to undergo a Polymerase Chain Reaction Test to rule out coronavirus infection since both illnesses have similar symptoms. “People suffering from fever should also visit hospitals rather than self-medicating,” he said. Bhairahawa-based Bhim Hospital has also seen an increase in the number of patients suffering from a viral infection, according to Dr Siddhartha Pandey, the information officer at the hospital.“The number of viral fever patients visiting the hospital is increasing by the day. Some health workers at the hospital are also suffering from viral fever. They, too, are admitted at the hospital and are receiving treatment,” said Pandey. In Kapilvastu, more than 60 patients suffering from viral fever have been visiting the District Hospital in Taulihawa every day. According to Dr Ganesh Chhetri, the medical officer at the hospital, most viral fever patients are aged between 15 and 30 years. “The number of viral fever patients has increased in the last week. There could be a number of reasons behind it. It could be seasonal flu or something else. That’s why it’s advisable to visit a hospital if one is suffering from fever or cold,” said Chhetri. “So far, viral fever patients at the hospital have not tested positive for Covid-19.”According to the District Health Office in Dang, the number of viral fever patients has increased in the district as well. “The threat of coronavirus is still high and viral infection poses more challenges in dealing with the pandemic,” said Angad Bahadur Shahi, chief at the District Health Office in Dang. At least two to three viral fever patients are visiting the Rapti Provincial Hospital in Tulasipur every day for treatment, according to Dr Binod Singh, medical superintendent at the hospital. The Health Unit in Tansen Municipality of Palpa also reports a rise in viral fever cases alongside Covid-19 cases. Chandra Tara Basyal, the public health inspector at the Health Unit in the municipality, said, “Viral fever and Covid-19 infections have risen in Tansen bazaar. Many people are found purchasing medicines for fever, cold and cough from local pharmacies.”The 10-bed isolation ward of Rampur Hospital in Palpa is also occupied with viral fever and Covid-19 patients. “The number of viral fever and Covid-19 patients has been increasing of late. It is a cause for concern, as we are still in the midst of the pandemic,” said Dr Bijaya Pariyar, acting medical superintendent of the hospital.(Manoj Paudel in Kapilvastu, Durgalal KC in Dang and Madhab Aryal in Palpa contributed reporting.)","Published at : July 27, 2021",Rupandehi,Sanju Paudel
Going digital eases forest management,"Data entry and record keeping have become easy for forest officers in Kapilvastu after the forest offices turned to technology a year ago. The forest offices in Kapilvastu have transitioned from paper to digital platform, with officers like Basanta Thapa, the assistant forest officer of Gorusinghe-based Sub Division Forest Office in Kapilvastu, using tablets with ease to enter data such as names, sizes, GPS locations and other details of trees that are marked to be felled.The details are then immediately sent to the Division Forest Office in Kapilvastu, the head forest office in the district, says Thapa. “The forest offices have become technology friendly and this has made our work a lot easier,” said Thapa. “I had to keep a diary to take daily notes on my visits to forests. It took some time to get used to technology, but after one year of daily use, we have made progress.”A team of forest officials, including technicians, regularly go on field visits to monitor the trees in the forests. “We enter all necessary details of our visits onto the software named Scientific Forest Management Support System,” said Thapa. “This has increased efficiency in our daily work.” The entered data is saved in the main server of the Division Forest Office in Kapilvastu district headquarters through an application. “Officials in the district headquarters verify the details and issue permission to cut down trees after completing the process. We receive a digital copy of the permission and don’t have to wait for lengthy paperwork,” said Thapa. “It saves a lot of time and effort.”For the past year, sub divisional forest offices in Patana, Pipara, Badhara, Motipur, Gorusinghe and Chetaradenhi of Kapilvastu have been using the software for data keeping. Like Thapa, officials in these offices use tabs for data collection.“The new system has reduced our workload,” said Thapa. “The software allows us to keep records of the length and circumference of trees, which is really helpful. It also leaves minimal room for mistakes when it comes to record keeping and keeping track of trees in different community and collaborative forests.” Sixty-nine community forests and two collaborative forests use the software in Kapilvastu district. According to the Division Forest Office in Kapilvastu, it invested Rs 600,000 to introduce the software across all forest offices. “Data keeping has become easier since the introduction of the software. The collected data is also safe and reliable. The use of software has brought immediacy, transparency and uniformity in our work across all levels,” said Ishwori Prasad Paudel, division forest officer in Kapilvastu.According to Madan Mohan Shandilya, assistant forest officer and also coordinator of the software programme, despite the initial reservations of forest officials, the software has come as a boon. “In the beginning, it was hard to learn to use the software and the tablet but now everybody has become adept at it,” said Shandilya. “We no longer have to rely on old files to see our records. Work efficiency of our employees has also increased.”","Published at : July 25, 2021",Kapilvastu,Manoj Paudel
Floods damage arable land in Pyuthan every monsoon,"The Jhimruk stream in Pyuthan destroyed around 246 hectares of cultivable land in 2016. Since then the stream has been continuously breaching its banks and destroying huge swathes of paddy fields and threatening settlements at Bagdula, Punyakhola, Bijuwar, Jurmi and Kwadi, among others.Bhuwan Pandit, a local resident of Badar in Pyuthan Municipality Ward-10, lost his paddy field to the stream five years ago. During the dry season, the area where his arable land used to be turns into a sandbed. ""I used to grow 12 muri (one muri equals 72 kilograms) of paddy every harvest season,” said Pandit. “But now the field has become barren, filled with stones, pebbles and sand.” In July 2016, the flooded stream had destroyed arable land from Damti to Dakhakwadi. Still, local farmers still have hopes of reviving the destroyed fields and seeking the help of authorities. “We can toil in the fields and revive it but since there’s still no embankment to keep the stream from entering the fields again, we feel it will be a wasted effort,” said Pandit. “If authorities help us build an embankment, we can go back to farming the land again.” Hemraj Pandit, a local resident of Pyuthan Municipality Ward-7, said he also lost his paddy field to floods in the Jhumri stream five years ago. “I used to grow three muri of paddy in my field but for the past five years, I haven’t tried farming. The stream can damage the fields again and I don’t want my hard work to go to waste.” Embankments have been constructed in some parts, but this hasn’t solved the problem, says Hemraj. “There should be embankments along the entire stretch of the river to save lives and property,” he said. The stream still spills over its banks every monsoon, flooding fertile fields. “Over the past few years, the stream has turned around 300 ropanis of paddy fields in Pyuthan Municipality into sandbeds,” said Negan Singh Kunwar, a resident of Pyuthan Municipality-10. The local people have constructed a Gabion wall along the 100-metre stretch of the stream at their own expense, as the government authorities did nothing to help them control the floods. “The local government has not spent even a single rupee to construct the embankment or taken any measures to stop flooding,” said Kunwar.The Water-Induced Disaster Management Committee and Irrigation Division Office in Pyuthan constructed embankments in some places along the stream but have failed to repair and maintain the embankments. “They constructed embankments in flood-prone areas but soon after the monsoon hit, the embankments were washed away,” said Shalikram Pandit, a resident of Pyuthan Municipality-7.Around 1,000 ropani of paddy fields in the Saribang Pyuthan Municipality-10 have already been damaged by floods. A total of Rs 11 million was spent to control floods in Pyuthan district under the People’s Embankment Programme in the last fiscal year. According to Bishnu Bhakta Thapa, the accounts officer at Pyuthan office of the programme, the budget was released to construct embankments at seven different places from Thulabensi of Gaumukhi Rural Municipality to Khaira of Pyuthan Municipality. However, Rs 3 million allocated for the construction of embankment at Khaira was frozen as the construction work could not be initiated last fiscal year.“The embankment construction work could not be done as the budget was released at the end of the fiscal year 2020/21,” said Pandit of Tikuri. “Had the budget been released earlier, we could have formed consumer committees and taken the responsibility of building embankments ourselves.”","Published at : July 23, 2021",Pyuthan,Shamsher Bikram GC
Haphazard excavation of limestone poses landslide risk in Palpa local unit,"On July 8, three people were killed and five houses swept away in a landslide at Hiude Khola in Tinau Rural Municipality Ward No. 5, Palpa. Six other houses in the settlement are still at risk of being swept away by landslides.According to the local people, haphazard extraction of limestone from the cliffs in the upper part of Hiude khola has led to frequent landslides over the past years.“Dolomite Limestone Pvt Ltd. operates a limestone mine in the upper part of Hiude Khola, which is just above the incident site. The landslide brought down limestone and debris towards the downstream settlements,” said Dal Bahadur Darlami, chairman of Ward No. 5. “Excessive excavation of limestone coupled with heavy and continuous rainfall in the area might have led to the landslide in the first week of July.”At least 45 households in Panimil and Jhumsa areas of Tinau Rural Municipality are at risk of landslides. According to the local people, the cliffs above the settlements have developed several cracks due to haphazard limestone extraction. Around fifty-metre stretch of the road between Panimil and Jhumsa along the Siddhartha Highway has also caved in. The road between Hiude Khola and Chhaubismile has also suffered damages from the landslide debris. “The government is only focused on generating royalty through limestone excavation. They are not looking into the environmental repercussions of such activities,” said Prem Prasad Pandeya, ward chairman of Tinau-3. Currently, three limestone mines are in operation above the highway area in Tinau Rural Municipality. Landslides pose a risk to 33 houses in Shreedanda, near the limestone mine of Siddhartha Minerals Pvt Ltd in Tinau. The area sees active landslides every year, according to local people. “Excavation of limestone has also led to the drying up of natural springs. Irrigating our fields has become difficult with water sources drying up every year,” said Deepak Bajagain, a resident of Jhumsa.The movement of heavy vehicles along rural roads has added to the weakening of the landmass, leading to road cave-ins. According to the data of the District Traffic Office in Palpa, more than 800 trucks carrying limestone pass through the Siddhartha Highway on a daily basis.“The cliffs in Jhumsa, Hiude Khola and Panimil areas have been chipping away for the last two years,” said Bajagain.Limestone mines have been in operation in Tinau for the last 14 years. Rajesh Shrestha, spokesperson of Tinau Rural Municipality, says the local unit has been witnessing several landslides in the last few years because of the haphazard extraction of limestones. “The local people have been voicing their concerns about the operation of limestone mines in the area, which has led to the frequent occurrence of natural disasters,” Shrestha said.","Published at : July 18, 2021",Palpa,Madhab Aryal
"As many as 42 houses at high risk of landslide in Thulogaun, Rolpa","As many as 500 people of 42 households in Thulogaun, Rolpa Municipality-10 of Lumbini Province are at high risk of landslides.“The tightly clustered houses at Thulogaun are at risk of being buried by landslides. When it rains, the villagers run to safer places,” said Sher Bahadur Thapa, a ward member of Rolpa-10.According to him, the mayor and the chief district officer have been informed about the risk of landslides in the settlement but the authorities are yet to respond.A massive landslide had struck the village in June last year. The landmass below the settlement has developed several cracks since then.“The landslide last year damaged roads, foot trails and a drinking water project and swept away several ropanis of cultivable land,” said Thapa. “The disaster left deep cracks in the land, making the whole village vulnerable to landslides.”Several settlements in the Dhabang area of Rolpa Municipality-10 are prone to landslides every monsoon. The local people have complained that the authorities concerned have done little to control the landslides or relocate the settlements to safer locations. “The Dhabang area is affected by landslides every monsoon,” said Man Bahadur Khatri, the ward chairman of Rolpa-10. “The villagers have to live with constant fear, as authorities have not taken initiatives to find a permanent solution to the crisis.” According to the local people, as many as 147 families in Thulogaun were affected by last year’s landslide. “Among them, 42 households are still at high risk,” said Khatri. The local people say their plights have been ignored by the local unit, the district administration and the provincial and federal governments.“The people’s representatives, municipal authorities and the district administration are well aware about what’s been happening here. But no one has come forward with help,” said Ramsur Pun, a resident of Dhabang. Chief District Officer in Rolpa Nawaraj Sapkota said the District Administration Office has been informed about the threat of landslides in Dhabang. “We have discussed with the security agencies and the representatives of the Disaster Management Committee to prepare for possible landslides,” he said. “We are also conducting a field study in Dhabang. Families at high risk of landslides can be shifted to local school buildings or in community buildings for safety.”A massive landslide struck Dhabang in 2003, displacing more than 100 families. Four people were killed in the disaster while 60 houses and animal sheds were swept away. “Every year during monsoon, our village gets prone to landslides. This year, wards 5 and 6 are the most vulnerable,” said Khatri, who is also the then chairman of Dhabang VDC.During last year’s monsoon, dozens of villages in Rolpa Municipality Ward No. 8 were at high risk of landslides.This year, many villages of Sunachhahari, Lungri, Madi and Tribeni rural municipalities are at risk of floods and landslides. “The authorities feign concern for us only during the peak monsoon season. The rest of the year, they do not think about preparing for disaster management,” said Pun from Dhabang. “They prepare for relief distribution but never think about preventing disasters in the first place.”","Published at : July 13, 2021",Rolpa,Kashi Ram Dangi
"Five years on, Phopli landslide victims yet to receive any help","Five years ago, Teke Pun, a resident of Phopli in Naubahini Rural Municipality-8, Pyuthan, lost his daughter-in-law and grandson in a landslide just above his house. Pun also lost 10 other relatives in the same landslide.“Every monsoon, I get reminded of that tragic day,” Pun said. “Our settlement is still at risk of landslides. The authorities have yet to move the settlement to a safe location.”Another Chhima Pun of the same settlement also lost her family members in the landslide five years ago. “My brother and two sisters were killed in the landslide that swept away our house. We have been living in a shed since then,” she said.According to the District Administration Office in Pyuthan, the landslide of July 25, 2016 had killed 27 individuals in Phopli and displaced around 200 families.Soon after the massive landslide, the then Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal had assured the landslide victims of relief on a par with the earthquake victims of 2015.“However, we have yet to receive any financial assistance from the government,” said Chhima. “We only got some clothes and food grains as relief after the disaster.”According to the local people of Phopli, around 50 households in the village are still at high risk of landslides. “Many politicians visited us and promised to relocate the settlement to a safe location. But they did not live up to their commitment,” said Puthe BK of Phopli. “Around 80 houses in the village sustained damages and cracks after the landslide. The settlement is at risk but we cannot move to a safe place by ourselves. The government has completely ignored our plight.”A few months ago, the federal government constructed seven houses near a local forest in Phopli under the People’s Housing Programme for the displaced families in Phopli. But the local people do not want to move there, as the houses have been built in the middle of the forest and they are reluctant to leave their ancestral village.Shivaraj Rijal, the chairman of Naubahini Rural Municipality, said the local unit has also managed electricity and drinking water facilities for the newly constructed houses.“But the beneficiaries refused to move there, stating that the houses have been built by the forest,” said Rijal.Ward Chairman of Naubahini-8 Obe Kami admits that the seven houses constructed at Rambari are not sufficient to house all the displaced families of Phopli.“The authorities could not find a safe location for all the displaced families,” Kami said.The District Administration Office in Pyuthan, however, said that it had no knowledge about the high landslide risk at Phopli. “Other local units have informed us about several settlements that are at high risk of landslides and floods. But we have not received any information about Phopli as of now,” said Chief District Officer Khimraj Bhusal.","Published at : July 11, 2021",Pyuthan,Shamsher Bikram GC
Covid-19 cases are increasing after relaxation of prohibitory orders in Lumbini,"The rate of Covid-19 infection has escalated again after the relaxation of prohibitory orders in Rupandehi and Banke districts.According to health workers, the virus has started to spread rapidly in the settlements since people have stopped following health safety protocols and maintaining physical distance in public areas.The district authorities in Rupandehi allowed the operation of businesses, transportation and other essential services July 3 onwards. This has led to an increase in public movement and a resurgence of coronavirus cases in the district, health workers say. On Thursday, 47 individuals tested positive for coronavirus in Rupandehi alone. “Currently, there are 381 active cases of Covid-19 in the district. Until July 3, the district had only 31 active cases,” said Dr Rajendra Giri, chief at the District Health Office in Rupandehi.Fifteen individuals died of Covid-19 in Rupandehi in the past week, according to the data of the District Health Office. “Covid-19 infection has been spreading day by day. The rate of infection has increased after the relaxation of prohibitory orders. The disease can only be controlled if people maintain social distancing and adopt safety protocols,” said Giri.Arjun Upadhayay, a resident of Tilottama Ward No. 6, said crowding in market areas has increased the risk of Covid-19 outbreak in the district. “The public must take precautions and follow health safety protocols to prevent Covid-19 from spreading,” Upadhayay said.According to Dr Nandu Pathak, the Covid-19 focal person in Butwal-based Corona Special Hospital, all beds in the designated Covid-19 treatment centre of Rupandehi are fully occupied by coronavirus patients.“By Friday, all 14 beds in the emergency ward, 38 in the medical ward and 14 in the ICU had been occupied. The rate of infection has increased due to the carelessness of the general public,” said Pathak.Currently, 14 Covid-19 patients are undergoing treatment at Bhairahawa-based Bhim Hospital. Dr Siddhartha Pandey, information officer at the hospital, said, “The number of coronavirus patients will increase again given the increase in public movement following the relaxation of prohibitory orders.”Chief District Officer of Rupandehi Asman Tamang said prohibitory orders were relaxed so the public could ease back to normalcy after months of being under lockdown. “But people are seen flouting health safety rules put in place for their own good,” he said. “Complacency and negligence will lead us to the eye of the coronavirus storm.” The situation in Banke district is similar to Rupandehi. Market places, transportation services, government offices and business activities have been allowed to operate for the past week in Banke. Like Rupandehi, Banke is also seeing an uptick in coronavirus cases since the relaxation of prohibitory orders.“In the last four days, the rate of Covid-19 infection has increased from 12 to 32 percent. We are far from safe from the virus,” said Dr Rajan Pandey of Bheri Hospital.According to him, Nepalgunj is again at risk of becoming a hotspot for coronavirus if immediate measures to contain the virus are not taken. “Until last week, the rate of Covid-19 infection was low in the district but cases are increasing again,” Pandey said.Between June 26 and July 1, the number of active cases in Banke stood at 33. The number has shot up to 52 by July 9, according to the Ministry of Health and Population.“We are looking at a resurgence of coronavirus cases in the district. We need to curtail public movement immediately to keep the virus under control,” said Dr Sanket Risal, the Covid-19 focal person at Bheri Hospital.Chief District Officer of Banke Shivaram Gelal said the district is seeing a rise in Covid-19 cases, as people are openly flouting health safety protocols.“Public places are getting crowded by the day with people not maintaining distance or wearing masks,” he said. “We can only hope they understand the risk of the virus.”According to the data of the District Health Office in Banke, 31 Covid-19 patients are undergoing treatment in the ICU of various hospitals and 367 patients are in home isolation in the district.","Published at : July 10, 2021",Rupandehi & Banke,Sanju Paudel						 &
Lumbini turns to bamboo to tame rivers,"The Lumbini provincial government has started a bamboo plantation campaign in all 12 districts of the province to create biological embankments along the banks of various rivers.The Ministry of Industry, Forest and Environment has initiated the campaign through 14 Division Forest Offices of the 12 districts. “The objective of planting bamboo on the riverbanks is to form biological embankments to prevent erosion and floods,” said Mohan Paudel, division forest officer in Palpa. Rudra Bahadur GC, a resident of Jhyangla in Tinau Rural Municipality-2, recalls the devastating floods of 1981 in the Dobhan stream that wreaked havoc in riverbank settlements. The calamity had killed 15 people and rendered around 45 households homeless. Floods in the Dobhan stream continued to cause huge destruction in Akkaleghat, Chisapani, Dol and Dobhan Bazaar for many years. The construction of the biological embankments is underway with the coordination of the local Bandelpokhari Community Forest Users’ Committee, Tinau Sub-Division Forest Office and the Division Forest Office in Palpa. “Bamboo saplings are being planted along the Dobhan stream now,” said GC.According to Ramdhyan Sah, the assistant forest officer at the Tinau Sub-Division Forest Office, works are underway to plant around 600 bamboo saplings along a 1.5-kilometre section of the Dobhan and Tinau streams. “This is a sustainable approach to building embankments. Once the biological embankments are formed, it will help reduce flood damage along the riverbanks and nearby settlements,” said Sah. Incidents of erosion and inundation near rivers and streams have increased in various districts of Lumbini Province of late. Padam Shakya, chairman of Tinau Forest Coordination Committee, said that the risk of floods and landslides can be controlled with biological embankments. “Bamboo plantations can save both human lives and properties,” said Shakya.Paudel, the division forest officer in Palpa, said bamboo plantation works in Purbakhola and Arunkhola bank areas have been completed. “Bamboo saplings are growing there,” he said. The Ministry of Industry, Forest and Environment has allocated Rs 14 million for the campaign in the current fiscal year.“The budget is being used by 14 Division Forest Offices of the province to plant bamboo on around 110 kilometres of riverbank areas,” said Rajendra KC, secretary at the Ministry of Industry, Forest and Environment.","Published at : July 1, 2021",Palpa,Madhab Aryal
Several settlements in hill districts of Lumbini at high risk of landslides,"Junga Bahadur Pun, the ward chairman of Gaumukhi Rural Municipality-3 in Pyuthan, has been staying in an animal shed for the past one year. He says he and his family started living in the shed, as his village is at risk of landslides.“The Khara settlement is gradually sinking. My house’s walls have developed cracks due to landslides. So we have been staying in the cowshed,” Pun said. “Many houses in my settlement are tilted with cracks now.”According to him, 13 families in the settlement take shelter either in their animal sheds or relatives’ houses every monsoon due to fear of landslides.The buildings of Khara Secondary School, a local community school, and the ward office of Gaumukhi-3 are also at risk of landslides. A massive landslide erupted just below the settlement last year, displacing Pun and 12 other families.According to Pun, a team of geologists, with the assistance of the Lumbini Province government, came to Khara to conduct a field study five months ago. “The geologists studied the landslide-prone settlement but did not give any information to the ward office. I am worried that a landslide will sweep away my settlement,” Pun told the Post.Not only Khara but several settlements in Gaumukhi Rural Municipality are at risk of water-induced disasters.The settlements of Paiyupata, Harjakhola, Thulakharka and Lekhchhahara are at high risk of landslides. The local unit said at least 10 houses in Thulakharka should be relocated to safer locations at the earliest due to erosion caused by Jhimruk river. “Similarly, the households in Lekhchhahara settlement of Gaumukhi Rural Municipality Ward No. 2 also need to be shifted to a safer place,” said Dor Bahadur Rana, the ward chairman of Gaumukhi-2.Despite the risk of landslides, the relocation process is yet to commence. “There is no safer place nearby to relocate the settlements and the villagers do not want to leave their ancestral settlements,” said Bishnu Kumar Giri, the chairman of Gaumukhi Rural Municipality.Of the nine local units in Pyuthan district, Gaumukhi and Naubahini rural municipalities are prone to floods and landslides. As many as 53 people in the area had been killed due to floods and landslides in 2016. “There are streams flowing below several settlements. The streams erode the banks each year, risking the settlements to landslides,” said Shivaraj Rijal, the chairman of Naubahini Rural Municipality. According to him, residents of Kurtibang, Syaulibang and Khabang settlements of Ligha need to be shifted to safer locations.Rolpa, another hill district of Lumbini Province, is also affected by landslides every year. According to the District Natural Disaster Management Committee, many settlements in Sunchhahari, Thabang and Tribeni rural municipalities are prone to landslides. “The villagers cannot sleep well in the rainy season due to fear of landslides. The topography in the area is very fragile. Furthermore, the haphazard construction of roads by using dozers leaves the settlements at high risk of landslides,” said Sher Bahadur Gharti of Seram in Sunchhahari Rural Municipality.The local people complained that the local unit and other authorities concerned have failed to take concrete steps to control landslides and relocate the villagers to a safe place. No preparations have been made to mitigate the risk of disasters, said Gharti.“Around 30 percent of settlements in the rural municipality are at risk of water-induced disasters,” said Pabitra Ghartimagar, the vice-chairperson of Sunchhahari. “Some efforts have been made but they are not enough to mitigate the risk of the disaster.” Gulmi is also one of the districts worst hit by water-induced disasters. Musikot and Resunga municipalities and Satyawati, Malika, Dhurkot, Madane, Chandrakot, Satyawati, Chhatrakot, Ruruchhetra, Kaligandaki, Gulmidarbar and Isma rural municipalities in the district are at high risk of landslides. “We are formulating an action plan to prevent any untoward incidents in the future. We have kept our team on standby to take necessary actions,” Chief District Officer of Gulmi Rudrawati Sharma.According to Sharma, the risk of landslides is high in the hills due to their fragile topography. “Haphazard construction of roads using heavy machinery in rural areas is also one of the leading causes behind landslides,” said Sharma. Road expansion works have increased the risk of landslides in Palpa district as well. Expansion works along the Tansen-Harthok road, Harthok-Chhahara road, Aryabhanjyang-Rampur road and the Siddhartha Highway, among other road sections in Kaligandaki Corridor, have put several settlements at risk of disasters, says Chief District Officer of Palpa Yogendra Prasad Pandeya.“The settlements in Rampur, Madiphant, Argali, Banstari, Jhadewa, Tinau, Arunkhola, Nisdi and Purbakhola Taar can face possible inundation this monsoon while there’s a threat of landslides in Jalpa, Devinagar, Jhadewa, Madanpokhara, Dovan and Tansen Sammobari,” Pandeya said.According to the District Disaster Management Committee in Palpa, over 200 families in the district are at risk of landslides and more than 225 families could be displaced due to monsoon-related disasters this year.Meanwhile, in Arghakhanchi, 24 families displaced by last year’s landslide in Shitaganga Ward No. 12 have yet to return to their settlement, as the risk of landslide is still there and the authorities have failed to relocate them to a safe place. A massive landslide had erupted at Kothiya Maidan in Shitaganga in September, 2020.

Office of Kaligandaki-Tinau Diversion Multipurpose Project established in Butwal,"The office of the much-awaited Kaligandaki-Tinau Diversion Multipurpose Project has been established in Butwal. Bishnu Paudel, deputy prime minister who is also the finance minister, inaugurated the project office in Butwal on Saturday.The project envisions irrigating 54,000 hectares of land in Kapilvastu and 53,000 hectares in Rupandehi and producing 126 MW electricity by diverting the water of the Kaligandaki river to the Tinau through a 38 kilometre-long tunnel. The estimated cost of the project is around Rs 138 billion.“The flow of water will increase in Tinau after the water from the Kaligandaki is diverted. We will be able to irrigate thousands of hectares of land in Rupandehi and Kapilvastu districts,” Paudel said during the inauguration programme on Saturday. “This is a game-changing project for Lumbini Province.”However, the Gandaki provincial government has been protesting the construction of the Kaligandaki-Tinau Diversion Multipurpose Project. “The construction work of the project will move ahead by coordinating with both the Gandaki and Lumbini provincial governments,” Paudel claimed. According to the Kaligandaki-Tinau Diversion Multipurpose Project Office, the Kaligandaki diversion dam will be constructed at Pipaldanda in Rambha Rural Municipality Ward No. 3 of Palpa.The Detailed Project Report will be prepared within a year, according to the office. Hydro Consult JV, the contractor company from Kathmandu, had conducted a feasibility study before the establishment of the office. Ten local units in Palpa of Lumbini Province and Syangja and Tanahun of Gandaki Province will be affected by the multi-purpose project. The project aims to divert the water of the Kaligandaki river from Ramdighat in Syangja to the Tinau river. According to residents of Devghat, the project would greatly affect the ecosystem of the area, its population and even the existence of Devghat—a revered place for Hindu pilgrims.According to Shanta Bahadur Shrestha, a former government secretary, after the completion of the project, the water flow in the Kaligandaki river will decrease by 40 percent, which will affect around 300,000 people from 10 local units in Tanahun, Nawalparasi (East) and Syangja.“The religious and tourism industry in the lower Kaligandaki river bank area will crumble after the completion of the project. The project is against the ecology and the principles of natural justice,” said Raman Bahadur Thapa, mayor of Rampur Municipality in Palpa district.","Published at : June 26, 2021",Rupandehi,Ghanashyam Gautam
Riverbank settlements in Bardiya at high risk of floods,"Prahlad Bhatta, a local resident of Tihuni in Ward No. 3 of Rajapur Municipality, Bardiya has not had a day’s rest since the rains began early June. Bhatta’s house is close to the Karnali river and at risk of inundation in case of floods in the river. “I go to the riverbanks every night with a torch in hand to check the water level in the river,” he said. “The river has caused great damage to our village in the past. This year too, it is threatening to breach its embankments and flood the village.” Like Bhatta, Suresh Chaudhary of the same village also walks to the riverbanks every day to check the water level. “I haven’t had a good night’s sleep since the monsoon began. The construction of the embankments is still not complete, which makes me very anxious,” Chaudhary said.According to the villagers, they are preparing to move to a safe location since floodwaters have started seeping into the village. “There is a high risk of inundation so some of us are preparing to move away,” said Bhatta.The flooded Karnali river has already swept away some gabion boxes filled with stones that were installed earlier this month to stop the floodwaters from eroding the riverbank area. Bhojraj Joshi, a local resident of Rajapur Ward No. 1, also a former member of the District Development Committee in Bardiya, said, “People living near the riverbank areas in Rajapur Municipality and Geruwa Rural Municipality are in direct threat of floods and inundation. There are no embankments in these areas.”For the last one month, the local administration has been pressuring the Karnali River Management Office to carry out construction works on the embankment. But since the rains haven’t let up, construction work hasn’t gained pace, said Santa Bahadur Sunar, chief district officer of Bardiya.“We had asked the Karnali River Management Project to speed up the construction of embankments. But then the pandemic and the prohibitory orders put all construction works to a stop,” said Sunar. According to the project office, 43 kilometres of embankment need to be constructed in Karnali and Geruwa river bank areas. Thirty kilometres of embankment is to be constructed in Karnali and 13 kilometres in Geruwa river areas.“The construction work started seven years ago but there has been no progress,” said Shankar Tharu, a local resident of Rajapur.Dharma Kumar Neupane, chief of the project, cites budget shortage as the main reason for the delay. The estimated cost of the project is around Rs 11 billion.Some villages in Nawalparasi (West) are also at risk of inundation and flooding as the Narayani river and other streams in the district are all rain-fed and gaining strength. Jitendra Harijan, a resident of Palhinandan Ward No. 1 in Nawalparasi (West), said, “My house was inundated last week. All of the food grains have gone to waste. We are looking at more difficult days ahead.”Over 50 houses in the settlement face inundation every monsoon. “However, none of the concerned authorities has taken initiatives to address our issue,” said Harijan.A Musahar settlement in Pratappur Rural Municipality gets waterlogged every monsoon but little has been done over the years to mitigate the risk of flooding. “Our settlement gets inundated every monsoon, as there is no proper drainage system to let the floodwaters pass,” said Rabindra Chaudhary, a local resident of Pratappur Ward No. 6. The settlements of Shankarpur, Rampur Khadauna and Maheshpur in Panlinandan Rural Municipality; Pusauli and Bhujahawa in Sarawal Rural Municipality; and wards. 3 and 4 in Pratappur Rural Municipality and Susta Rural Municipality also get waterlogged every year in monsoon. However, Baiju Prasad Gupta, chairman of Panlinandan Rural Municipality, says the local level does not have the capacity to initiate flood control measures by itself. “We have only been able to manage rescue and relief. Floods and inundation are recurring problems and it needs intervention from the federal level,” he said. In Banke, settlements in Rapti Sonari, Daduwa and Narainapur rural municipalities are also at risk of floods. “Five years ago, the flooded Rapti river displaced over 300 families in Holiya of Daduwa Rural Municipality. The displaced families are still living under huts near the riverbank area. They are unwilling to move from the site,” said Pateshwor Kurmi, ward chairman of Daduwa Ward No. 1.According to the office of Daduwa Rural Municipality, it has built a building for the displaced families to take shelter in.The settlements in Narainapur Rural Municipality are also at risk of flooding due to the rain-swollen Rapti river. Laxmi Kanta Mishra, an official at the Disaster Management Committee in the rural municipality, said, “People living near the riverbank areas of wards 1 to 5 are at high risk of floods. We have established shelters for the flood victims in three different places of the rural municipality.” On Thursday, a team of officials from the District Administration Office, District Police Office and the local units inspected the flood-affected areas in Banke district“Settlements in Narainapur, Daduwa and Raptisonari are at high risk of flooding. It has been estimated that at least 10,000 individuals will be affected by floods and inundation during this monsoon in Banke,” said Rupan Gyawali, an official from the team.According to Shivalal Gelal, chief district officer of Banke, his office has raised awareness on the threat of floods in riverbank settlements. “We have advised them to stay alert and safe. Authorities have also been advised to make preparations for the management of possible disasters,” Gelal said.(Nabin Paudel in Parasi and Madhu Shahi in Banke contributed reporting.)","Published at : June 26, 2021",Bardiya,Kamal Panthi
Tinau river is shrinking due to human activities,"Dayaram Neupane, 72, had migrated to Butwal from Argeli of Palpa district in 1966. He remembers the time when the flooded Tinau ravaged Butwal and its surrounding area in 1980. A resident of Butwal Sub-metropolis-12, Neupane says the only human activity along the river banks back then used to be farming. “Farmers used to dig irrigation canals to irrigate their paddy fields. But now, the river is dying. Its banks have been turned into towns,” he said. Over the decades, human encroachment of the river and its banks has turned the once mighty river into a shadow of its former self. The headwaters of the Tinau river originate in Palpa, a hill district of Lumbini Province. The river passes through the Mahabharat and Chure ranges before it enters Butwal in Rupandehi district. Conservationists say human encroachment and the rampant and haphazard extraction of sand, pebbles and stone in the Chure area are the reasons behind the shrinking of the Tinau river. “The exploitation of the Chure region has diminished the river’s size. The forest area is being cleared and the river bed materials are being extracted rampantly in the watershed area,” said Mahendra Pandey, a conservationist at Tinau Rural Municipality-3 in Palpa. “It used to be difficult to cross the river in the past. Now, the river is the size of a small brook.”As urban settlements grew and stone quarries were set up to extract limestone for cement factories in Palpa, the river shrank even more. “The limestone quarries are the small sources of water for the river. But even those sources are drying up,” said Pandey. According to him, the construction of roads through the forest area, concretisation of irrigation canals and lack of afforestation programme have greatly affected the ecology of the area. “Authorities are not concerned about conserving the Tinau,” Pandey said.The 95-kilometre-long Tinau river flows through the Chure range from Kerabari of Palpa to Butwal in Rupandehi district. “The river area has shrunk with human settlements set up on its banks. The exploitation in its watershed area has left the river dying,” said Ram Prasad Paudel, the former chairman of the President Chure Madhes Conservation Committee.Mahesh Raj Bhandari, whose family in 1968 migrated to Khasauli, another settlement near Butwal, says the river used to be so deep that people had to use a bridge to cross it.“The locals used to drink water from the Tinau river. But now there is hardly any sign of the river,” said Bhandari. The use of heavy equipment for the extraction of riverbed materials is illegal but local residents say that smugglers continue to use such equipment to take out aggregates. On Tuesday alone, a number of excavators and trucks were seen extracting and transporting sand, pebbles and stones from the Tinau river in Palpa district.","Published at : June 12, 2021",Lumbini,Sanju Paudel
Few people take Covid-19 jabs in Lumbini,"A 62-year-old man from Khoriya village in Yashodhara Rural Municipality-8, Kapilvastu, was to visit a local vaccination centre for his first dose of Covid-19 jab.The vaccine was administered on Tuesday and Wednesday. But he decided not to get it. “I fear the vaccine might not be suitable for me,” he said. The government has decided to inoculate the people of 62-64 age group with the one million doses of Vero Cell Covid-19 vaccine provided by the Chinese government on a grant. But many people in Lumbini Province seem to be fearful of the vaccine. Owing to the low participation, various local units in the province have decided to extend the vaccination drive by a couple of days. Kapilvastu is one of the worst Covid-19 affected districts in the province. The district has reported a total of 170 Covid-19 deaths since May. “The number of people visiting vaccination centres was quite low in the first two days. The District Health Office extended the drive by one more day but the footfall on the third day was also dismal,” said Umesh Ghimire, the Covid-19 control focal person at the District Health Office. According to him, only around 30 percent of the target group were vaccinated on Tuesday and Wednesday.Of the 1,000 doses provided to Karishnanagar Municipality, only 570 doses were administered while Suddhdhan Rural Municipality used 500 of total 730 doses and Maharajgunj used just half of 1,000 doses.According to the health workers, people are hesitant to get the jab due to various rumours about the side effects of the vaccine. Birendra Mishra, coordinator of Health Unit in Yasodhara Rural Municipality, said, “There is a lot of misinformation and confusion about Covid-19 vaccines. We are launching an awareness campaign to dispel such mistruths and assuage the people’s fear about vaccines.” In Rupandehi, the District Health Office provided 479 doses of vaccines to Rohini Rural Municipality to be used on the first day of the drive, but few people took the vaccine. “People did not visit the vaccination centres although they were informed about the vaccination drive. Almost everybody is hesitant to take the jab,” said Sanoj Kumar Yadav, the chairman of the rural municipality.Lumbini Sanskritik Municipality, another local unit in Rupandehi, has set up five vaccination centres. According to Dhrubaraj Ghimire, the health unit chief of the local unit, out of 1,391 vaccine candidates, only 1,078 people showed up at the vaccination centres. “We had to return 313 vaccine doses because some people did not want the shot,” said Ghimire. “Most people fear the side effects of the vaccine and it’s difficult to change their mindset.” Narainapur Rural Municipality in Banke aimed to inoculate 536 people on Wednesday, but only 45 of them got the vaccine. “It was the same on Thursday,” said Nagendra Kumar Sah, chief of the local health centre. “We returned the leftover vaccine doses to the district health office.” Narainapur had become a Covid-19 hotspot last year, but the local population is still hesitant to get vaccinated against the disease. In Rupandehi, the District Health Office aims to inoculate 1,455 individuals. The vaccination drive is underway at 69 vaccination centres of 16 local units for the last three days. “The vaccine doses have been sent to the local units on the basis of population distribution. Until Thursday, 11, 500 vials have been used in Rupandehi,” said Dr Rajendra Giri, chief at the District Health Office. “The local units will return the remaining vaccine doses to the District Health Office. They will be administered to the health workers.”The vaccination drive is also ongoing in Nawalparasi (West). According to the District Health Office in Nawalparasi (West), only 40 percent of the population were inoculated in the last three days. In Palhinandan Rural Municipality, out of 620 individuals, only 200 got vaccinated in the last three days.“People are hesitant to receive the jab. Most people don’t trust the vaccine and are waiting for other people to get vaccinated first. The rate of people getting vaccinated is also low in Susta, Pratappur and Sarawal Rural Municipalities in Nawalparasi (West),” said Dharmajit Patel, an auxiliary health worker of the rural municipality. In the last three days, only 600 people out of 1,100 from the target group took the Covid-19 jabs in Bardaghat Municipality. “We are conducting the vaccination campaign from two centres. Around 200 individuals are receiving the vaccine on a daily basis. The campaign will end within one to two days,” said Madhab Gyawali, chief at the health unit of the municipality.“The campaign is more effective in town areas compared to rural villages. We have started awareness campaigns in rural areas with the help of women health volunteers.”Krishna Prasad Pokharel, chief at the District Health Office in Nawalparasi (West), said few people from the target group in the rural areas have visited the vaccination centres. “We are discussing with the local people’s representatives to figure out what is causing the vaccine hesitancy. We are also planning to extend the vaccination drive by a few more days.”(Sanju Paudel in Rupandehi, Thakur Singh Tharu in Nepalgunj and Nabin Paudel in Parasi contributed reporting)","Published at : June 11, 2021",Kapilvastu,Manoj Paudel
Lumbini villages report rise in Covid cases,"Ruksebhanjyang bazaar in Nisdi Rural Municipality Ward No. 4 has been sealed until June 12 after the area reported a rise in Covid-19 infections.According to Rem Bahadur Magar, chief of the health unit of the rural municipality, out of 39 individuals who underwent antigen tests a few days ago, 21 tested positive for Covid-19. “We had not expected such a high positivity rate. The results indicate that Covid-19 cases are on the rise in rural areas,” said Magar. “The health unit recently performed antigen tests on 76 individuals in Ruksebhanjyang and found 26 individuals infected with Covid-19.”Ruksebhanjyang currently has 47 active Covid-19 cases. “All Covid-19 patients are in quarantine at Gaurishankar Secondary School. The rural municipality provides food and shelter to the patients. However, there are no health workers available at the quarantine centre to treat the patients,” Magar told the Post.The movement of people around the bazaar area has been restricted to prevent the virus from spreading, according to Neu Bahadur Sunari, chairman of Ward No. 4 of Nisdi Rural Municipality.“Ruksebhanjyang bazaar has been sealed to control the spread of the virus after a large number of individuals from the same settlement tested positive,” Sunsari said. Khasyeuli Harthok, another bazaar area in Ribdikot Rural Municipality Ward No. 3, has also been sealed for the last 15 days. The rural bazaar area, which is adjacent to the Palpa-Gulmi road section, is also greatly affected by Covid-19. “We recently conducted PCR tests on 39 individuals. Eighteen people tested positive for Covid-19. There are 25 families living in the bazaar area and they are all at risk of contracting the virus,” said Sunil Adhikari, chief at the health section of the rural municipality. At Itiya Tol in Rainadevi Chhahara Rural Municipality Ward No. 8, a large number of people were found suffering from common cold, cough, fever and other Covid-19-like symptoms for the past week. The health unit of the rural municipality ran antigen tests on 49 individuals; 11 tested positive for Covid-19. “The health unit conducted tests on those showing coronavirus-related symptoms,” said Jeevan Rana, chief at the unit of the rural municipality. “We were informed about the matter after a migrant worker who had recently arrived in Itiya Tol from India tested positive for Covid-19 at a Butwal-based health facility.”According to Om Prakash Panthi, information officer at the District Health Office in Palpa, Covid-19 infections are on a decline in urban areas but the rural areas like Rainadevi Chhahara are still at risk. “The local units have not been able to expand Covid-19 testing,” Panthi said.Although the district authorities have put prohibitory orders in place to curb the spread of the virus, they have failed to stem the movement of people in rural areas. “Prohibitory orders have not been effective to curb people’s movement in rural areas. People are found roaming around shops and public places without any masks or maintaining distance,” said Narayan Chaudhary, a local resident of Kohalpur.In Banke, too, there are many people suffering from fever, headache and other symptoms similar to that of Covid-19 in the rural parts of the district. But the local authorities have not initiated mass testing.“There are many patients with fever in my village. But they have not been tested yet,” said Hemanta Chaudhary, a resident of Rapti Sonari.Naresh Shrestha, the public health inspector in Banke, says antigen tests are being conducted only on those who visit a health facility for testing. “But since not many patients with Covid-19-like symptoms go to health facilities for testing, we have provided antigen kits to the local units in Banke to ramp up testing,” Shrestha said. Health officials say the rate of Covid-19 infection has been rising in the rural parts of Lumbini Province. Eighty-eight infected people are receiving treatment at Nepalgunj-based Bheri Hospital. Dr Sanket Risal, a senior physician at the hospital, says the risk of Covid-19 is still high in the rural areas. “A mass testing should be conducted to contain the virus,” he said. In Kapilvastu, the infection rate is higher in rural areas as compared to urban centres. Umesh Ghimire, the Covid-19 control focal person at the District Health Office, said, “The infection rate is around 10 to 15 percent in the urban areas while it stands at 35 to 40 percent in the rural areas.”One of the contributing factors to the low rate of testing in rural areas is the local people’s hesitancy to get tested for fear of social stigma, Ghimire said.“The villagers fear ostracisation by their community members in rural settlements. They refuse to be tested unless their health condition deteriorates,” said Birendra Mishra, health unit coordinator of Yashodhara Rural Municipality.The situation in Maharajgunj, another local unit in Kapilvastu, is also the same. Only 27 people underwent antigen tests in the municipality in the past month. “We have set up antigen testing centres at 11 places in the municipality. But even symptomatic people refuse to get tested,” said the health unit coordinator Radheshyam Jayaswal.In Dang, the virus is gradually spreading in the rural settlements but the villagers rely on homoeopathic medicines to treat Covid-19 suspects.“There is utter negligence on the part of rural villagers. The villagers do not go to health posts even when they are taken ill,” Numananda Subedi, the chairman of Rapti Rural Municipality. Most of the villagers are currently busy in their fields for the harvest of corn and other crops and in cultivating land for paddy plantation. “Fever patients are increasing in the villages but almost everyone is working in the fields,” said Bhuwaneshwor Paudel, the chairman of Babai Rural Municipality in Dang. “Almost every household has a patient suffering from coronavirus-like symptoms but they refuse to go to the health facilities for the testing and treatment.”Meanwhile, the number of Covid-19 patients is on a decline in Rupandehi, a hotspot for the virus during the second wave of the pandemic. The flow of patients to various coronavirus-designated health institutions has eased in the past few days in the district.Dr Rajendra Giri, chief at the district health office, said the number of Covid-19 cases is decreasing due to the prohibitory orders in place and a good recovery rate of the patients. According to him, 147 people tested positive for the coronavirus in Rupandehi on June 3 but only 65 people tested positive on June 8. The district has 1,062 active cases at present. “The infection rate is declining in Rupandehi. Only 71 Covid-19 patients are receiving treatment—eight in ventilators and 24 in ICU—in six different hospitals in the district now,” said Asman Tamang, the chief district officer of Rupandehi. According to him, the health officials are carrying out antigen tests of more than 4,000 people in the community on a daily basis.

Conservationists build nests for rare Indian spotted eagles,"Bird conservationists have launched a campaign to build artificial nests for the Indian spotted eagle, a globally threatened bird species limited mainly to the Indian subcontinent, to ease its nesting and breeding process.Conservationists have built nests in tall trees for the Indian spotted eagle to lay eggs and hatch them successfully. Ornithologists Tulsi Subedi, Sandesh Gurung and their aids have been studying the bird species to encourage their nesting in the Lumbini area. According to Subedi, the population of the Indian spotted eagle is dwindling as less than 50 percent of its fledglings grow up. “We have been studying the breeding of the Indian spotted eagle and building artificial nests for the bird species. Their natural nests get heavily damaged by wind and rains, hugely affecting their successful breeding rate,” said Subedi. “We have studied their behaviour and built nests in suitable locations. But we are relying heavily on our instincts hoping the birds will use the nests.”A total of 13 artificial nests have been built in the Lumbini area of Rupandehi district, Bhagawapur area of Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve in Sunsari district and Dhanushadham Community Forest in Dhanusha district. The conservationists have built five nests each in Koshi Tappu and Lumbini and three in Dhanusha forest.In Lumbini, two nests have been built near the Lumbini Peace Stupa and one each near Gate No 7, the banks of Telar stream and on the premises of Lumbini Buddha Garden Hotel. These nests have been built in Sisau and Simal trees above 20 metres from the ground.It took nearly three months for the conservationists and their team to build the artificial nests. A platform of around one metre in diameter has been fixed to the tree with nails and wires. Some dried twigs and leaves are laid on the wooden platform for it to resemble a nest built by Indian spotted eagle.“It took us three hours to make a single nest. We studied the movement of the eagle for a week and built a nest at locations they frequently visit,” said ornithologist Gurung.According to the ornithologists, the bird species nests and lays eggs between May and August.The southern plains of Nepal is the habitat of the Indian spotted eagle, which has been enlisted as a vulnerable species in the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) Red List. It is estimated that there are 30 to 70 Indian spotted eagles in Nepal and 2,500 to 10,000 in the world. This eagle species is found mainly in Nepal, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Vietnam and Cambodia.According to ornithologist Hem Sagar Baral, the conservation of the Indian spotted eagle is challenging and its population dwindling globally. “Less than 50 percent of its fledglings grow up. Various studies show the big fledglings prey on the small ones,” said Baral.According to conservationists, the Indian spotted eagle is losing its habitat due to deforestation, fragmentation of land and the use of insecticide and pesticide in farming. “More than 90 percent of Indian spotted eagles live in the farmland and near human settlements. They prey on field rats and frogs.”Nepal is home to six eagle species. Among them, the Indian spotted eagle is the smallest in size. This bird species is considered helpful to farmers, as it preys mainly on rats, frogs, parrots, sparrows and other aquatic birds that destroy crops.","Published at : June 8, 2021",Lumbini,Manoj Paudel
No testing and essential medicines for Covid-19 suspects in Upper Dolpa,"A large number of local residents in Dolpobuddha, Chharkatangsong and She-Phoksundo rural municipalities of Dolpa district have been taken ill with fever, common cold and headache for the last two weeks. But since there is no road network reaching these rural villages, health workers haven’t been able to provide the patients with the necessary treatment and medicines. According to people’s representatives, there isn’t enough essential medicine in the region to treat the patients that are showing symptoms similar to that of Covid-19. “The villagers haven’t recovered even in two weeks’ time. Health workers are doing their best to contain the spread of the disease but the number of people falling sick is growing,” said Kyalpo Thapa Bhote, chairman of Dolpo Buddha Rural Municipality Ward No. 1. “Almost every house in Ward No. 1 has at least one patient suffering from fever, cough, cold and body ache.”Although the villagers are suffering from coronavirus-like symptoms, health workers have not confirmed Covid-19 infection since the villagers have not been tested for Covid-19 for a lack of testing facilities.On May 6, two health workers and two technicians from Dho in Upper Dolpa were airlifted to a Surkhet-based hospital after they showed symptoms of Covid-19. They tested positive for the virus.“If we could transport medicine and medical supplies to the region, we would be able to save many lives,” said ward chairman Bhote. According to him, Dolpa natives living in Kathmandu have collected 27 types of essential medicines and other medical supplies, including oxygen cylinders and concentrators, to be sent to their villages in Dolpa. “But since there is no road connectivity, the supplies have to be flown in from Kathmandu. We are looking for people who can help us do that,” said Bhote. The office of Dolpobuddha Rural Municipality has been requesting the Karnali provincial government to help in the supply of medicine but to no avail. “The villagers rely on herbal medication if they fall sick. Many ministers have said they will look into the matter but no one has done anything so far,” said Temba Gurung, chairman of Dolpobuddha Rural Municipality. It takes three to six days on foot to reach the District Hospital in Dolpa from Upper Dolpa. In most cases, Covid-19 patients are referred to health facilities outside the district since the district hospital is not equipped to handle critical Covid-19 cases. The 50-bed hospital has one ventilator, which is currently not in use for a lack of skilled staff, and two beds with an oxygen facility.There are no doctors available in any of the local units in Upper Dolpa. Amar Singh Shahi, acting health manager at the Health Service Office in Dolpa, said the local units should manage all expenditures for the care of Covid-19 patients. “But there’s no such mechanism for the management of Covid-19 patients in Upper Dolpa,” he said.","Published at : June 5, 2021",Rukum (west),Hari Gautam
Health workers at Bheri Hospital call probe committee’s report unfair,"The probe committee—which was formed to investigate last week’s attack on health workers at Bheri Hospital—made public its report on Wednesday, stating that the incident took place as the family of the deceased acted ‘in a fit of rage’ after the health workers ‘failed to give clear answers about the patient’s health to his relatives.’The committee also suggested that the medical personnel should work on improving relations with the relatives of patients seeking treatment.Following the findings of the committee, the medical fraternity in Banke has said the committee failed to provide a fair investigation into all aspects of the incident since it has not addressed the issue of violence against women.Sadiksha Gaire, one of the nurses at the hospital attacked by the relatives of a Covid-19 patient on May 29, feels the report does not do justice to the medical staff, mostly women, who were assaulted.“The report does not mention anything in regard to the assault on the female medical staff,” said Gaire. Gaire, who had to face six to seven angry relatives of the deceased, was grabbed by her neck by one of the men of the family. “I don’t feel safe anywhere anymore. From the moment I step outside my house to go to the hospital until the time I reach home, I fear someone will attack me,” Gaire told the Post. “We may recover from the physical assault but the verbal abuse will stay with us for a long time.”Ashwini Gurung, another nurse who was attacked, says she too feels threatened and scared after the incident. She questions the report released by the probe committee on its indifference to violence against women.“The report does not have a single point referring to the violence we had to face that day,” said Gurung. According to Shila Sharma, nursing in-charge at Bheri Hospital, women health workers have been feeling anxious and unsafe at work since the incident. “The result of the investigation puts the blame on health workers and forgets to register the assaults on our health workers that day,” said Sharma, who is also the nurse coordinator at the Covid-19 ward of the hospital. “We had submitted an application to the National Women Commission. But the incident has been completely politicised. I don’t feel safe here either.” The committee said in its report that the relatives of the deceased attacked the health workers impulsively owing to misunderstandings. The shortage of human resources at the hospital during the pandemic and unfolding events after the patient’s demise were the causative factors, says the report. According to Assistant Chief District Officer of Banke Shankar Bista, also the coordinator of the probe committee formed by the District Administration Office, the committee prepared its report after visiting the incident site and inquiring with the doctors and health workers who were attacked, the accused party, eyewitnesses and attendants of other patients receiving treatment at the Covid-19 ward on the day of the incident.The 53-year-old man from Dang had been admitted to Bheri Hospital on May 18. The patient was put on ventilator support after his health condition deteriorated on May 27 but he died the same night.Relatives of the deceased barged into the ward, vandalised the intensive care unit and assaulted the team of doctors and nurses present there, claiming that the patient died due to the negligence of the medical team at the Covid-19 ward. The brothers of the deceased man, Man Bahadur Rawat and Bharat Rawat, and son Lokraj Rawat, among other relatives, attacked the health workers. Some of the health workers fled the site by jumping off a window from the hospital's first floor.“The incident seems to have taken place as the health workers could not provide information about the patient’s health issues,” said Assistant Chief District Office Bista.The protesting health workers have called the report unfair and have decided to continue their protests until their demands are met. Dr Binod Karna, the chairman of Nepal Medical Council in Banke, said, “Our demands still stand. We want the assailants to face five years in prison. We will continue our protests till our demands are addressed.”The health workers have been staging demonstrations from 5pm to 6pm every day. Basanta Gautam, the focal person of Advocate Forum, a rights organisation in Banke, agrees with the medical staff of Bheri Hospital and says that the case of violence against women has been brushed aside in this incident. “The case of violence against women has been sidelined here. It goes to show that there is no safe working environment for women in this country,” Gautam said. The District Police Office in Banke had arrested three accused soon after the incident. The accused are in police custody. “The report submitted by the probe committee has recommended that the deceased’s brothers and son be charged for attempted murder and public offence,” said Chief District Officer Shivaram Gelal.","Published at : June 5, 2021",Banke,"Thakur Singh Tharu						,"
Uncertainty over availability of vaccine worries senior citizens,"Sarala Uprety, aged 75, of Aandabag in Kapilvastu Municipality-1 has been inquiring about the availability of the second dose of Covid-19 vaccine at the local health office for the past month. She was administered the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine on March 7.She often calls her son in Kathmandu and daughter who is now in Japan and asks them to look into the vaccination dates.“When I call the health office, the health workers say they don’t have the vaccines,” said Uprety. Sixty-five-year-old Grischandra Dube of Kapilvastu-3 has also been inquiring with his family members and acquaintances about the arrival of the second dose of vaccines. “Two to three people have died of coronavirus in our neighbourhood. I am very worried about my health,” said Dube. “I would feel greatly relieved if only I were fully vaccinated.” In Tilottama Municipality-6 in Rupandehi district, senior citizens are awaiting the second dose of vaccine for similar reasons. Ekanath Simkhada, 73, says he was administered the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine on March 15. “We were told to get our second jabs a month ago. I had gone to the local health post but the health workers turned me away,” said Simkhada, who is waiting for his second dose of Covishield. “Just getting the first dose might not be effective to shield us from the virus. I think it will be of no use if we don’t get the second dose.”Thousands of senior citizens like Uprety, Dube and Simkhada in several districts of Lumbini Province are awaiting the second dose of Covid-19 vaccines. They have expressed their displeasure and concerns as the government authorities have not been able to procure the second dose so far.“The first dose of Covid-19 vaccine boosted my confidence. But the second wave of the pandemic has proved to be fatal and I feel my confidence faltering. We must get our second dose soon,” said Dandapani Sharma, 75, of Butwal-11. According to Dr Rajendra Giri, chief at the District Health Office in Rupandehi, a total of 37,591 people above the age of 65 were administered the first dose of Covid-19 vaccines in Rupandehi. He is unclear about the availability of the second dose of vaccines for those who have taken the first jab. “We don’t have vaccines. The country doesn’t have vaccines so if the situation worsens, we will be caught unprepared yet again,” Giri said. According to the District Health Office in Kapilvastu, more than 27,000 senior citizens across 10 local units in Kapilvastu are waiting for the second dose. The health office ran the vaccination drive through 94 vaccine centres across Kapilvastu district. “We have asked the provincial government to immediately manage the second dose of vaccines for the elderly population,” said Hemraj Pandey, the chief at the health office in Kapilvastu.Senior citizens across the country were administered the Covishield vaccine produced by the Serum Institute of India from March 7 to 15. In Kapilvastu, the vaccination drive for those above 65 was launched between March 7 and 13. According to the World Health Organisation, the second dose of the vaccine is recommended within 8 to 12 weeks after getting the first jab. The senior citizens of Kapilvastu, therefore, should have been given the second dose by the end of May.In Banke, around 20,000 people are waiting for the second dose. According to Bheshraj Sharma, the immunisation officer at Banke Health Office, those above 65 years of age were administered the first dose of Covid-19 vaccines from March 7 to 12. “The second dose should be administered within three months. But there is still no supply of vaccines,” said Sharma. In Palpa, around 16,500 elderly people are waiting for the second dose.Around 69,000 people—mainly frontline health workers and security personnel—have received both doses of Covid-19 vaccines in Lumbini Province as of now. According to Kaushal Bhandari, the Covid-19 focal person at the Lumbini Provincial Health Directorate, 278,322 people in the province are waiting for the second dose of vaccine. It is still uncertain when they will be administered the second dose, he said.

Villagers in rural parts of Lumbini Province refuse to get tested for Covid-19,"A 55-year-old man from Rainadevi Chhahara Rural Municipality-2 in Palpa, who was suffering from coronavirus-like symptoms, refused to get tested when the local unit sent a health team to his settlement to collect swab samples of coronavirus suspects for Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests.His health deteriorated in the next few days, his family members say, and he was taken to the Lumbini Medical College for a PCR test. His test report confirmed Covid-19 infection. His family members then took him to the Lumbini Provincial Hospital in Butwal for treatment. But by the time the family managed to secure a bed at the hospital, it was already too late. He died the next day. “We tried to convince the deceased to undergo a PCR test for timely treatment. But he refused,” said Javanath Pokharel, the ward chief of Rainadevi Chhahara-2.Another man, aged 49, of the same settlement also died last week for a lack of timely treatment. He, too, had refused to get tested during the health team’s visit. In the rural areas of Lumbini Province, the local authorities are having a tough time convincing coronavirus suspects to undergo Covid-19 tests. The social stigma associated with Covid-19 and fear of the disease have led the local people to hide their health condition from their neighbours and even family members. A 49-year-old man, who recovered from Covid-19 and is back home from the hospital, says he was also hesitant at first to get tested for Covid-19 after seeing an infected family in the village being shunned by the villagers.“The family needed help but were socially boycotted,” he said. “So I also refused to give my swab sample for testing when the health team came to my village. I later visited Tansen Hospital after I had difficulties in breathing.” He tested positive for Covid-19 on May 21. Because of the social stigma surrounding Covid-19 patients and fear of hospital visits during the pandemic, coronavirus suspects postpone getting tested and treated, according to health workers. This is also what is leading to community transmission of coronavirus in rural villages of Lumbini.“The local people do not offer information on their health condition willingly,” Dr Pujan Shrestha, the medical officer at Hungi Health Post in Rainadevi Chhahara, told the Post. “We are only informed about the infection rate when the virus has spread in the community and many people start falling sick with coronavirus-like symptoms. The patients seek medical care only when it’s too late for treatment."" Lal Bahadur Darlami, the ward chief of Rainadevi Chhahara-3, says the people’s representatives and the health officials are making efforts to educate the villagers on Covid-19.“We have requested the villagers to strictly follow the prohibitory orders and to inform us about any health complications they face,” said Darlami. “We are also trying to dispel the stigma attached to being a Covid-19 patient.”According to him, seven people in the ward have died of Covid-19 since mid-April. “Most of the deaths occurred for a lack of timely treatment. The patients came to us at the eleventh hour. Many of them died in the course of treatment at various hospitals in Palpa, Butwal and Kathmandu,” he said. In Rukum (East), a medical team reached Pokhara settlement in Sisne Rural Municipality on May 16 after the health authority was alerted by the people’s representatives of many villagers suffering from fever and common cold. But only 43 people came to the health camp to get their swab samples tested even though scores of villagers were taken ill.The medical team reached Nayagadh, another settlement in the local unit, on May 18. Only 44 people gave their swab samples. Of the 87 samples collected from Pokhara and Nayagadh, 30 tested positive for the virus.“We dispatched a health team to the settlements where people are suffering from symptoms similar to that of Covid-19. But the suspects refuse to visit the health camp and give their swab samples for PCR test,” said Dr Purna Bahadur Pun, a doctor at the district hospital.

Hospitals unprepared to screen and treat black fungus cases,"Health workers are suspecting that a 60-year-old man from Kapilvastu, who had recovered from Covid-19 earlier, recently died of black fungus at the Lumbini Provincial Hospital.The man, a patient of diabetes, had recovered from the virus at the Corona Hospital in Butwal last month. “But after he recovered and was discharged from the hospital’s ICU, he started complaining of prolonged headaches and even lost his vision. The patient died in the course of treatment at Lumbini Provincial Hospital,” said Dr Sudarshan Thapa, senior consultant physician at the hospital. “He had all the symptoms of black fungus. We did not document the patient’s condition as black fungus, but we believe that the patient died of the disease.” The “black fungus” is an infection caused by a group of fungi, which is on the rise among Covid-19 patients and survivors, doctors say. In the last two weeks, four Covid-19 patients were found with the black fungus infection at Nepalgunj-based Bheri Hospital. “Among the four patients, one died while undergoing treatment at the hospital,” said Dr Rajan Pandey, chief consultant physician at the Bheri Hospital. According to him, patients with diabetes are more vulnerable to black fungus.Black fungus is not transmissible like Covid-19, said Naresh Shrestha, the health officer in Banke. “The infections can be seen in one out of 1,000 Covid-19 patients,” he said. “We have sent some black fungus patients from Nepalgunj to Kathmandu for treatment in the last few days.” According to doctors, black fungus develops in Covid-19 patients when they are treated through supplemental oxygen and steroid medicines in the High Dependency Unit or Intensive Care Unit. “A patient’s immune system gets compromised during the treatment for Covid-19 and that is when the fungus develops in them,” said Dr Thapa. “Sometimes, eye removal surgeries are needed to stop fungal infection from reaching the brain.”So far, black fungus patients have not been reported in Kapilvastu. Dr Kishor Banjade, medical superintendent of the District Hospital in Kapilvastu, said the hospital has been alerted on the rising cases of black fungus in the country and that it will be on the lookout for the infection.Meanwhile, in Bardiya district, there’s not a single preparation going on to prevent and treat black fungus. “We have no ophthalmologist here. This is why the treatment of black fungus is not possible in the district,” said Dr Subhash Pandeya, medical superintendent of the District Hospital in Bardiya.Similarly, the health institutions in Sudurpaschim Province, which are already suffering from a poor health infrastructure, are far from prepared to handle the impending threat of black fungus. Seti Provincial Hospital in Dhangadhi, the major hospital in the province, is yet to prepare treatment services for black fungus patients.“We are yet to ascertain if there are black fungus cases in Sudurpaschim Province or not. We need to be fully prepared for the treatment of such patients, as many people in neighbouring India are suffering from the disease,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Kamar, a consultant physician at the provincial hospital. “Black fungus cases have not been reported in the hospital as of now.”Dr Hemraj Pandey, the medical superintendent at the provincial hospital, admits that the institution could have problems in providing treatment to black fungus patients in the region. “We need to think about the possible cases of black fungus and prepare accordingly,” said Pandey. “The hospital will take the necessary initiatives to handle the infection.”Mahakali Hospital in Mahendranagar, meanwhile, claims that it has started preparations to identify black fungus cases and provide treatment to the patients.“The hospital has been holding regular talks with ENT (ear, nose and throat) doctors for the diagnosis and treatment of black fungus patients. The process to buy medicines required for the treatment of black fungus is also underway,” Dr Hari Shrestha, the medical superintendent at Mahakali Hospital. “Both the Covid-19 patients and doctors should be careful about the possible contraction of the fungus.”Currently, 50 Covid-19 patients are receiving treatment at Mahakali Hospital. “The hospital has not reported any black fungus cases so far,” said Dr Gobinda Rokaya, the coronavirus focal person at the hospital.

Health workers protest attack on medical personnel at Bheri Hospital,"Sadikshya Gaire has been working at Bheri Hospital in Nepalgunj as a staff nurse for the past two and a half years. She has been deployed to the Covid-19 ward of the hospital since last year when the coronavirus pandemic raged across the country. Gaire, 22, was among the health workers who were manhandled by a patient’s relatives on Thursday night at the hospital after he died during the course of treatment earlier on Thursday night. “The assailants attacked me and grabbed me by my throat. I ran away and hid in the intensive care unit with other nurses. But they broke into the unit,” she said, showing assault marks on her neck. “We ran into a bathroom and locked ourselves in. They tried to break the door open. I instinctively jumped out of the bathroom window to escape. I was genuinely scared for my life and that of my colleagues.” According to the doctors at the hospital, a 53-year-old man from Dang was admitted to the hospital on May 18. The patient was put on ventilator support after his health condition deteriorated on Thursday. He died the same night.Relatives of the deceased, accusing the medical team at the Covid-19 ward of negligence, barged into the ward, vandalised the intensive care unit and physically assaulted the team of doctors and nurses present.Jumping out of a first-floor window to escape the attackers, Gaire landed on a pile of sand saving her from any major injuries. Although she was unscathed, the incident has left her terrified. There were five staff nurses including Gaire and a doctor working at the Covid-19 ward when the incident occurred.“I was running an electrocardiogram (ECG) test on the patient at around 8:15pm. His attendants were threatening to harm me if I failed to treat the patient,” said Gaire. The attacks started soon after. “I was at a loss; I didn’t know what to do,” she saidOn Friday, doctors, nurses and health workers of Bheri Hospital protested against Thursday night’s attack that put the lives of several medical staff at risk. The health workers chanted slogans at the premises of Bheri Hospital throughout the day and reached the District Administration Office raising their demands on Friday noon. Their slogan, ‘No security, no work. Punish the assailants’ was their cry for help. They have condemned the police’s inaction even when they were informed about the unfolding events at the hospital on Thursday night. According to the hospital administration, the deceased man’s son and brothers assaulted health workers alleging that he had died because he was put on ventilator support. Man Bahadur Rawat, the brother of the deceased, asserts that his brother died due to the negligence of the health workers. “My brother was talking to us before he was put on ventilator support. We had requested them not to put him on a ventilator. My brother died because of it,” Raut wrote on Facebook. Dr Chandra Prakash Sahu of the Covid-19 ward refutes Raut’s claims. “The patient’s family had asked us to keep the patient on ventilator support on Wednesday. But all the ventilators were occupied then. So we placed him on a ventilator when one became available on Thursday but he did not survive,” Sahu said. According to Ashwini Gurung, another staff nurse who was on duty with Gaire, the patient’s oxygen level had reached a very low level. “We had to put him on the ventilator. But a few moments later, the patient’s family members barged into the ward and started manhandling us,” Gurung said. “We don’t know what would have happened to us if we hadn’t fled that night.”She too had jumped out of the bathroom window with Gaire. After the incident on Thursday night, a team of government officials including Chief District Officer Shivaraj Gelal and Superintendent of Police Om Rana had reached the hospital to take stock of the situation. The District Police Office in Banke arrested three assailants soon after the incident.“We have started an investigation on the three involved in Thursday night’s incident at Bheri Hospital,” said Om Rana, Superintendent of Police, also chief at the Banke Police Office. Gelal has formed a committee headed by Assistant Chief District Officer Shankar Bista to investigate the incident. In the last three weeks, incidents of misbehaviour against and manhandling of health workers have increased in Nepalgunj as the number of Covid-19 patients seeking treatment at various hospitals has spiked.On May 7, Upendra Singh, a paramedic deployed at the emergency ward of Bheri Hospital, was attacked by a Covid-19 patient’s attendants after the death of the patient. On April 29, another patient’s attendant attacked a staff nurse at the hospital.Dr Sanket Risal, a senior physician, says the hospital administration had issued a statement demanding action against the guilty. “But the District Administration Office and District Police Office did not take the issue seriously,” Risal said. “There were no measures taken to prevent such incidents from happening at the hospital again.”According to him, health workers now fear for their lives in the absence of a safe working environment at the hospital.“How much can we take? There is never a day when we are not threatened by the relatives of patients at the hospital,” said Risal. “Most of us are on duty 24/7 given the high flow of Covid-19 patients at the hospital. Such attacks on us not only expose us to physical harm but also wreck our mental well-being. We begin to question our own sanity.” Dr Laxman Sigdel, another doctor at the hospital, says health workers there have not been able to focus on their duty as threats and assaults have become a regular nightmare. “We feel belittled. We feel betrayed. We won’t be able to do our jobs when we are afraid for our own lives,” Sigdel said.On Friday, various health organisations across the country issued statements demanding strong action against the guilty of the Thursday night incident. The district and central committees of Nepal Medical Association have also condemned the incident. Laxmi KC, Banke chapter chairperson of the Nursing Association of Nepal, said: “The police have taken some of the perpetrators in custody but we fear they will be released. If that happens, we will hold protests until justice is delivered.” On Friday, six critical Covid-19 patients, who were undergoing treatment at Bheri Hospital, died amid protests by the health workers. The health workers have said they will not return to work until the authorities take action against the individuals involved in the attack and until arrangements are made for their security at the hospital.Banke is one of the districts hardest hit by the second wave of the coronavirus that is ravaging the country. So far, 270 Covid-19 patients coming from outside Banke and 288 patients from Banke have died of Covid-19 in the district, according to the District Health Office.","Published at : May 29, 2021",Nepalgunj,Thakur Singh Tharu						 &
Health workers protest at Bheri Hospital following attack on medical personnel,"Health workers at Bheri Hospital on Friday staged a protest against the assault on doctors and nurses by relatives of a Covid-19 patient, who died while undergoing treatment.The Banke-chapter of the Nursing Association of Nepal protested the incident inside the hospital premises. On Thursday, medical personnel at the Covid-19 ward of the hospital were physically assaulted by the relatives of the deceased, accusing the doctors and nurses involved in the treatment of negligence. The deceased, a resident of Dang, was admitted to the hospital on May 18. The patient was put on ventilator support after his health condition deteriorated. According to the hospital, the deceased’s son and brothers assaulted Dr Chandra Prakash Sahu and nurses Asmini Gurung and Sadiksha Gaire alleging that their relative died after he was put on ventilator support. The attackers also barged into the intensive care unit of the hospital and vandalised medical equipment. The association had also issued a statement condemning the attack on medical personnel and demanded action against those involved, and create a favourable environment for health workers to work without fear. The local administration has formed a committee under the coordination of Chief District Officer Shankar Bista to investigate the incident.

Absence of contact tracing spells trouble for Lumbini,"A 31-year-old woman from Tilottama Municipality-6 in Rupandehi district suffered from fever and cold on May 9. Her polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test confirmed Covid-19 infection and she was isolated at home.Her family members, however, did not feel the need to get tested since none of them had been showing symptoms of Covid-19. They continued to move around the marketplaces and mingled with people in the neighbourhood.A few days later, some of them started showing symptoms of Covid-19. When they got tested, their results came back positive.Around a dozen people from five houses in the community have tested positive for Covid-19 in the last two weeks.A man from Butwal-11 tested positive for Covid-19 on May 6. The 28-year-old government employee says he caught the virus at his workplace. “I immediately informed the local unit. I also requested the sub-metropolis to conduct a PCR test of those who had come in my contact,” he said. “The health workers came to my house to collect my swab sample only after four days and the PCR report came after 14 days. Fortunately, all my family members tested negative. We were all under a lot of stress while waiting for the test results,” he added.The health authorities are not actively contact tracing in communities across several districts of Lumbini Province, say local people. Symptomatic patients go to hospitals and health centres to get tested but those exhibiting no symptoms do not take the initiative to get tested. The lack of testing and contact tracing has led to the rapid spread of the virus in communities, local people say. The local units and the health offices are not actively working to collect swabs for contact tracing. As a result, the number of people carrying out PCR tests has decreased. Meanwhile, Dr Rajendra Giri, chief at the District Health Office in Rupandehi, says the infection rate in the district has been on a gradual decline. But he also admits that his office has yet to account for cases that haven’t been reported in the absence of contact tracing and testing. “The authorities haven’t been able to carry out mass testing on a larger scale as compared to last year. We have asked the local units to prioritise tracing and testing but they have cited a lack of resources,” he said.Keshav Bhattarai, the corona focal person of Tilottama Municipality in Rupandehi, said that the municipal office offers antigen tests to only the family of Covid-19 patients who succumb to the disease, and to those in emergency situations. “The health ministry has asked those who come in contact with a Covid-19-infected person to stay in home isolation,” he said. “It is impossible to trace suspects when the infection rate is so high.” The spread of Covid-19 in Banke too has gone unchecked even though the district administration has imposed prohibitory orders for the past month. Doctors call for an effective contact tracing of Covid-19 suspects if the curve is to be flattened in the district.“The current data shows erratic highs and lows in the number of infections reported per day. The authorities must initiate mass testing because the current approach to testing leaves out a chunk of the population who can’t afford to undergo tests,” Dr Rajan Pandey, a consultant physician at Bheri Hospital, told the Post.“Contact tracing must be expanded to control the disease from spreading further,” he said. Naresh Shrestha, the public health officer at the District Health Office in Banke, said contact tracing in the district has come to a halt due to the high infection rate.“The virus is spreading rapidly across settlements. It is impossible to trace and test people since the number of positive cases is overwhelming and we only have limited resources,” Shrestha said. Eight local units in Banke are yet to initiate contact tracing at the community level for a lack of antigen and VTM kits, says Ram Bahadur Chand, chief at the Health Section of Nepalgunj Sub Metropolis. “We plan to purchase kits and start conducting tests soon,” he said.In Kapilvastu too, several local units are facing a shortage of necessary equipment to run tests in the communities. “Only a few antigen tests have been performed in the district since we don’t have enough kits,” said Umesh Ghimire, the corona focal person at the District Health Office in Kapilvastu. Lal Bahadur Darlami, ward chairman of Rainadevi Chhahara Ward No. 3 in Palpa, says his local unit has also stopped contact tracing and testing. “Three weeks ago, we had collected the swab samples of some returnees from India. Since then, no testing has been done here,” he said. Om Prakash Panthi, information officer at the District Health Office in Palpa, says the office distributed over 2,200 antigen kits and 450 VTM kits in various local units. “But the local units have not conducted any tests. We have an additional 1,000 antigen and 1,500 VTM kits in the District Health Office,” said Panthi, adding that they have requested local units not to stop testing.In Barbardiya Ward No. 9 of Bardiya district, almost every household has patients with common cold and coughs. No testing has been conducted in the area yet. “We cannot conduct testing due to a lack of antigen and VTM kits amid a surge of Covid-19 cases,” said Deepa Gautam, vice chairperson of Badhiyatal Rural Municipality. Sunil Chapagain, a local resident of Barbardiya, said that people with Covid-19 symptoms are seen roaming around in the market areas or meeting with people.“Since there is no testing done here, one wouldn’t know if you are infected or not. This has led to the spread of the virus locally,” he said.The situation is similar in Madhuban, Rajapur, Bansgadhi and Thakurbaba municipalities and Geruwa and Badhaiyatal rural municipalities of Bardiya. “We could not expand testing due to a lack of antigen and VTM kits. This has increased the risk of Covid-19 spread in the communities,” said Ganesh KC, mayor of Madhuban Municipality.

Local units install oxygen plants at Covid-19 hospitals,"Various local units, hospitals and organisations in Rupandehi, Kapilvastu, Gulmi and Arghakhanchi districts of Lumbini Province have come together to help install oxygen plants to scale up Covid-19 treatment in some of the worst-hit districts in the province.The second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic has laid bare the fragility of the health infrastructure across the country, as Covid-19-infected people are dying from a shortage of life-saving medical oxygen at hospitals. On May 12, 11 Covid-19 patients undergoing treatment at the Corona Special Hospital in Butwal, Rupandehi lost their lives after the hospital ran out of medical oxygen. The same day, three Covid-19 patients died at Bhairahawa-based Bhim Hospital.Bhim Hospital is still reeling under a shortage of medical oxygen despite the efforts of the local administration, various organisations and oxygen gas suppliers to supply the hospital with oxygen cylinders. “Our consumption is around 300 oxygen cylinders per day. The local government and some organisations and individuals have provided the hospital with oxygen cylinders but it’s not enough,” said Narayan Prasad Bhandari, chairman of the hospital development committee. “We plan to install an oxygen plant within the hospital premises. The hospital has so far collected Rs 800,000 with donations from various local units, businessmen, social organisations and local people.” Tilottama Municipality in Rupandehi established a 40-bed isolation facility after the start of the second wave of the pandemic but all its beds are currently occupied. The municipality is now setting up a 100-bed Covid-19 hospital at Tilottama Ward No. 9. According to Basudev Ghimire, mayor of the municipality, the hospital will have its own oxygen plant.“The construction of the Covid-19 hospital is almost complete,” said Ghimire. “Oxygen pipes have been connected to every bed. This will ensure 24-hour oxygen supply to the patients,” said Ghimire, adding that the plant can generate oxygen to fill 15 oxygen cylinders at once. The municipality has spent Rs 2.2 million to install oxygen pipes at the hospital. According to Ghimire, the Ministry of Finance provided Rs 6.5 million to run the Covid-19 hospital. “Covid-19 patients from Tilottama will not have to go to Butwal or Bhairahawa for treatment,” said Ghimire. “With the installation of the oxygen plant, the hospital at Ward No 9 will be able to provide care to critical Covid-19 patients as well.”Sainamaina Municipality in Rupandehi is also constructing an oxygen plant at the temporary Covid-19 hospital in the municipality. “We have asked for a budget from the Ministry of Finance to install the oxygen plant. We have also been collecting funds from donors,” said Chitra Bahadur Karki, mayor of the municipality.Local units in Kapilvastu have also started installing oxygen plants at Covid-19 hospitals in the district. Kiran Singh, mayor of Kapilvastu Municipality in Kapilvastu, said, “We have decided to install an oxygen plant rather than purchasing and refilling oxygen cylinders. The municipality will install the plant within 15 days.”According to him, since no help was forthcoming from the federal and the provincial governments, the local unit decided to initiate the construction of an oxygen plant. “We are prepared to fight the pandemic. Our municipality will not face a shortage of oxygen moving forward,” he said. Bandganga Municipality in Kapilvastu also recently decided to construct an oxygen plant through a local-level executive meeting. “We have started to conduct a pilot study for the construction of the oxygen plant. The municipality will also seek help from donors if we run short of funds,” said Basudev Khanal, chief administrative officer of the municipality. So far, Lumbini Province has recorded 1,214 deaths from Covid-19 and 66,922 positive cases. According to the data of the Ministry of Social Development in the province, there are 15,858 active cases in the province at present.","Published at : May 22, 2021",Lumbini,Sanju Paudel
"Self-medication proving fatal for Covid-19 patients, health experts say","It had been two weeks since a 56-year-old man from Butwal-3 in Rupandehi district was suffering from common cold, fever and body aches. He consulted a local pharmacy and took medicines for a couple of days but his health did not improve.A couple of days later, he got his swab sample tested for Covid-19 infection. He tested positive and chose to stay in home isolation, his family members say. But on May 15, his health condition worsened and his family rushed him to the Corona Hospital in Butwal. The critically ailing man was admitted to the High Dependency Unit at the hospital. “He was shifted to the Intensive Care Unit the next day but we could not save him,” said one of his family members. The patient died the same day.Another infected man, aged 58, from Siddharthanagar-6, Rupandehi, also suffered from similar health problems. He had been suffering from fever and cough since May 3, so he visited a local pharmacy and bought antibiotics upon suggestion from the pharmacist. “But I didn’t get any better. I went for a PCR test and the result showed I was Covid-19 positive,” said the man. “I took medical oxygen for days at home as my oxygen saturation was low. But it was not enough. I went to Bhim Hospital after I couldn’t breathe properly,” said the man. He received treatment lying on a mattress on the hospital floor since all the beds at the Covid-19 unit of the hospital were occupied. “I returned home after my oxygen level crossed 92.”According to Dr Sudarshan Thapa, senior consultant of Lumbini Provincial Hospital, Covid-19 patients choosing to self-medicate or relying on local pharmacies for treatment over visiting a hospital is proving fatal for them. In the past year, multiple reports have surfaced of people buying self-prescribed medicines relying on information shared on social media platforms and messaging apps.Thapa, who has been involved in the treatment of Covid-19 patients for the past one year, says most people are taking antibiotics for illnesses with Covid-19-related symptoms. “Around 70 percent of Covid-19 patients visit hospitals only after their self-medication fails to cure them. They purchase medicines for fever and common cold from the medical stores,” he said. “It is wrong to treat Covid-19 as typhoid, flu or other bacterial diseases.” “Wrong medicines may lead to bacterial infection and make the patients more sick,” said Thapa. “One should visit a hospital if one develops fever, cough, body ache, common cold or any other health-related problems.”A woman from Rainadevi Chhahara Rural Municipality-4 in Palpa district recently visited a local pharmacy, where she bought paracetamol, zinc tablets, vitamin C and vitamin D. She did not have a doctor's prescription. “The prescription shared on social media recommended these medicines and vitamin tablets for those who show symptoms similar to that of the coronavirus,” she said. Nanda Kishor Badhai, aged 34, of Kapilvastu-4 had all the symptoms of Covid-19 but did not want to undergo a PCR test. He bought medicines from a local pharmacy but his health worsened on the fifth day of suffering from fever and cold. He was taken to Taulihawa Hospital on Monday evening. He passed away the next morning.Similar incident took place at Shivaraj Municipality-5, Kapilvastu. A 48-year-old man took medicines for fever and sore throat for a week but his health did not improve. On Sunday, he was rushed to Shivaraj Basic Hospital after his condition worsened. “His oxygen level was just 42 when he was taken to the hospital. He passed away on Monday,” said Chudamani Bhattarai, the health unit chief of Shivaraj Municipality. According to Dr Subhash Pandeya, medical superintendent of the District Hospital in Bardiya, the rate of Covid-19-related deaths has increased as patients have been taking medicines without consulting a doctor.“Most of the patients do not visit health facilities for treatment. They only visit hospitals if they face breathing problems,” said Umesh Gupta, the health coordinator of Kapilvastu Municipality. “This is also why Covid-19-related deaths are on the rise.”“Most are in denial of having contracted Covid-19. They want to put off treatment as long as possible because they don’t want to accept that they have been infected, fearing worst-case scenarios,” he said. A 63-year-old man from Tilottama-5, Rupandehi, who also took self-prescribed medicines from a local pharmacy for fever and common cold, is currently admitted to the ICU at the Corona Hospital in Butwal. “We took him to the Corona Hospital in Butwal after the lab test confirmed Covid-19. He is now in the ICU,” said his eldest son.Dr Jhapendra Dhakal of Sancho Health Care Pvt. Ltd in Tansen, the district headquarters of Palpa, says most Covid-19 patients in the district have become heavily reliant on pharmacies for treatment, especially in the rural areas, since there are hardly any medical officers available at medical clinics or local health posts outside Tansen.Medical stores in both the cities and rural areas of Palpa have run out of paracetamol among other essential medicines after a surge in the number of people buying the tablets.Indra Baral of Himalaya Model Pharmacy in Rainadevi Chhahara Rural Municipality, Palpa, said, “There’s a shortage of paracetamol, zinc and vitamin C tablets, among other medicines. The flow of people purchasing such medicines has surged in recent days.”","Published at : May 20, 2021",Lumbini/palpa/kapilvastu/bardiya,"Sanju Paudel						,"

Lumbini hospitals under-equipped to handle rising coronavirus cases,"On Monday, the District Hospital in Rukum (East) installed a tent and admitted a coronavirus patient to its Covid-19 ward, taking the number of Covid-19 patients receiving treatment at the hospital to seven.Six of the patients are receiving treatment at an under-construction building of the District Hospital. All of the patients are on oxygen support, health workers of the District Hospital in Rukum (East) say. Until a few days ago, the hospital had only five beds for Covid-19 patients. It added one bed a few days ago but does not have space to put additional beds.Doctors at the hospital visit the Covid-19 patients thrice a day but haven’t been able to treat the infected for a lack of essential medicines. “We are somehow managing medical oxygen for the patients but we don’t have enough medicines to go around,” Purna Bahadur Pun, a doctor at the hospital, told the Post. “We are rationing our limited supply of medicines. Essential medicines used in the treatment of Covid-19 patients are in short supply in the market.” According to him, the hospital is not only facing a shortage of essential medicines but also of other necessary medical supplies such as face masks, Personal Protective Equipment and hand sanitisers, among others. “We have only a few face masks, a couple of bottles of sanitisers and PPE sets left at the hospital,” said Shovna Singh, a staff nurse at the hospital. “It’s been challenging to take care of Covid-19 patients without the necessary equipment.”According to her, out of six staff nurses at the hospital, three are deployed in the general ward and three have been mobilised for the treatment of Covid-19 patients.Since mid-April, 111 individuals have tested positive for Covid-19 in Rukum (East), according to the data of the District Health Office. Among them, four died and seven individuals are undergoing treatment at the District Hospital. Around a 100 individuals are in home isolation, the data of the District Health Office showed. Similarly, the District Hospital in Rolpa, which is a designated Covid-19 treatment centre in the district, is running from a dilapidated hospital building.The Covid-19 patients in the district are undergoing treatment at the old hospital building which was built five decades ago. The District Hospital in Rolpa admits around a dozen Covid-19 patients on a daily basis amid a shortage of physical infrastructure and human resources.“Since we are also running the Out Patient Department for non-Covid-19 patients, the hospital is stretched thin,” said Dr Prativa Subedi, a medical officer at the hospital. The hospital hasn’t been able to run Covid-19 tests on suspects since it does not have enough antigen kits. “We do not have a PCR machine here. It takes at least a week to obtain PCR reports from the laboratories in Dang, Banke, Kapilvastu or Rupandehi. This has led to problems in the identification of Covid-19 patients. We are providing treatment based on their symptoms,” said Subedi.The District Hospital in Rolpa says it may have to refer Covid-19 patients to hospitals outside the district in the next few days, as it has only a few cylinders of medical oxygen left.“We have only a few oxygen cylinders left. The provincial and federal governments should address this issue immediately,” said Dr Prakash Bahadur Budha, acting medical superintendent at the hospital.According to Budha, the hospital has no other option but to refer critical Covid-19 patients to Dang, Banke, Kapilvastu or Rupandehi-based health facilities due to a lack of oxygen and testing kits.The data of the District Health Office in Rolpa shows there are around 400 active Covid-19 cases in the district at present. Most of the infected are in home isolation while the remaining are admitted to various isolation centres, officials at the health office say.In Arghakhanchi, the health workers at the district hospital also say they are under immense pressure due to the lack of medical equipment and poor physical infrastructure.Auxiliary Health Worker Ashok Chauhan at the hospital says the absence of ICU beds is the biggest challenge plaguing the health facility. The hospital does not have an ICU. “We have lost some critical Covid-19 patients for want of treatment,” he said. According to the hospital chief Dr Kapil Gautam, the hospital is also reeling under a shortage of medicines, health equipment and most importantly, oxygen. “It’s getting difficult to save Covid-19 patients amidst all the shortages,” he said.There are 10 HDU beds and six general beds in the Covid-19 ward of the Arghakhanchi hospital.Currently, 29 Covid-19 patients are receiving treatment at the hospital. “The number of patients seeking treatment at the hospital is increasing every day. We are compelled to find donors to refill empty oxygen cylinders,” said Gautam.Gulmi, another hill district of Lumbini Province, is facing a similar ordeal. “We have to provide treatment to all patients—Covid and non-Covid—while facing a shortage of oxygen, medicines, PPE and other health equipment,” said Dr Uttam Pachya, chief at the district hospital in Gulmi. Various hospitals in the rural areas of Lumbini have been hit hard by the second wave of the pandemic, as they are not equipped, in terms of medical infrastructure and human resources, to deal with the health crisis. “One doctor has to take care of 35-40 patients per day. We don’t have enough staff nor sufficient resources,” said Dr Tilchan Pandeya, a general physician at Palpa-based Lumbini Medical College. “The hospital has an old oxygen plant that does not produce enough oxygen. We have had to turn away both Covid and non-Covid patients since we have been stretched to the limit.”","Published at : May 19, 2021",Rukum (east)/palpa/rolpa/arghakhanchi,"Hari Gautam						,"
Only Covid-19 hospital in Arghakhanchi does not have intensive care unit,"On Tuesday, Dr Kapil Gautam, chief at Arghakhanchi Hospital, requested a Covid-19 patient’s family to look for a hospital with an Intensive Care Facility after the patient’s health worsened. The hospital, the only government health institution to provide healthcare for Covid-19 patients in the district, does not have an ICU. The hospital administration and the patient’s family searched for an ICU bed in other hospitals of Lumbini Province throughout the day. But there were no beds available at any of the hospitals they contacted. The patient died at the hospital the same day. Gautam says the patient was facing difficulty in breathing and was in dire need of an ICU bed with a ventilator.“But none of the hospitals we reached out to had ICU beds. The patient could have been saved if we had been able to provide the needed treatment on time,” he said. The Ministry of Social Development in Lumbini Province has delayed providing necessary medical supplies to the hospital, according to Gautam. “I have been requesting ministers and provincial assembly members to manage ventilators and ICU at the hospital. But it has not happened yet,” he said. The district hospital has been running on basic medical infrastructure and is not equipped to deal with Covid-19 cases, health workers say. There are currently 24 Covid-19 patients receiving treatment at the hospital. Its 10- bed High Dependency Unit and six general beds are all occupied. Some of the patients have been put on beddings on the floor.But for the rural population in the district, getting treatment even at the poorly equipped Arghakhanchi Hospital is in itself a huge relief.Since the hospital is located in Sandhikharka, the district headquarters of Arghakhanchi, people from other parts of the district depend on local health posts that are in worse condition than the district hospital and are run on the bare minimum.On Wednesday, Shiva Thapa of Thulapokhar in Ward No. 6 of Arghakhanchi visited a local health post for a check-up after suffering from fever and common cold. Health workers at Thulapokhar Health Post gave him some medicines and advised him to rest at home.Thapa is worried he might have contracted Covid-19. He will have to go to Arghakhanchi Hospital to get a PCR test done.“The health workers have asked me to do a PCR test if I do not recover even after taking medicines for a few days,” said Thapa. “But we hear that the hospital does not have ICU or ventilators. I am extremely worried.” Seeking treatment outside the district is also not an option for most, especially those who are in need of immediate critical care, since Butwal, the closest city, is at least a four-hour ride from Sandhikharka, the district headquarters of Arghakhanchi. Puja BK, also from Thulapokhar, visited the same health post with similar complaints. She was also prescribed some medicines and advised to rest. The health workers suggested she get a PCR test done if her health condition worsens. According to Thulapokhar Health Post, at least 20 to 30 people visit the health post on a daily basis with complaints of fever and common cold. “Each household has at least three to four family members down with the same symptoms,” said Bishwodev Neupane, in charge of the health post. “We have requested them to stay alert. Some patients have recovered after taking medicines for common cold and fever whereas some have tested positive for Covid-19,” said Neupane.According to health workers, a large number of villagers started falling ill in April after they attended several weddings and feasts in the settlements. Manju Khanal, in charge of Dhakawang Health Post in Ward No. 1 of Bhumikasthan Municipality, says the health post, too, has been seeing an increasing number of patients suffering from fever and cold in the last few weeks.“We receive 15-25 patients in a day. Most are suffering from fever and cold,” she said. “We ask them to get a PCR test done if they don’t feel better after taking medicines.” Dhikura Health Post has also been seeing an increasing number of patients seeking treatment for similar illnesses, says Seeta Paudel, an auxiliary nurse midwife at the health facility. Villages in Sisne Rural Municipality Ward No 1, 2, 3 and 4 of Rukum (East) have been reporting a massive surge in the number of people suffering from fever and cold. Lokendra Khadka, a local resident of Sisne Rural Municipality Ward No. 3, says almost every household in his village has at least one patient suffering from fever and cold. “We’ve been informed of fever patients in every house but we haven’t been able to run any Covid-19 tests on them because of a shortage of antigen testing kits,” said Gowardhan Budhamagar, vice chairman of Sisne Rural Municipality. Similarly, Puthauttarganga Rural Municipality of Rukum (East) has also reported of people falling ill with fever and common cold. “Most think it’s viral fever but we can’t be sure until we get our tests done,” said Man Bahadur Roka, a local resident of Ward No. 8 in Puthauttarganga Rural Municipality. Samir Giri, the health coordinator of Puthauttarganga Rural Municipality, says they haven’t been able to conduct Covid-19 tests in the rural municipality due to a lack of antigen testing kits.","Published at : May 16, 2021",Kathmandu,Birendra KC						 &
Oxygen shortage costs 14 lives,"Eleven Covid-19 patients, undergoing treatment at Corona Special Hospital in Butwal of Rupandehi district, lost their lives after the hospital ran out of medical oxygen on Wednesday afternoon.The same day three Covid-19 patients died in Bhairahawa-based Bhim Hospital.A total of 14 Covid-19 patients died due to oxygen shortage in Rupandehi district on Wednesday.Most Covid-19 health facilities in Rupandehi have been reporting a shortage of oxygen supply since Tuesday. News of oxygen shortage circulated on various media outlets including social platforms throughout Tuesday. The hospitals providing treatment to Covid-19 patients had appealed to the government bodies seeking help and informing them about the catastrophic results if immediate steps weren’t taken.Some hospital administrators had themselves reached the District Administration Office in Rupandehi on Tuesday evening and informed the authority about the acute shortage of oxygen supply at various hospitals in the district. They had asked the authority to manage oxygen until Tuesday midnight. But no tangible help was forthcoming.“Efforts are on to refill oxygen from Chitwan, Pokhara and Biratnagar excluding the production within the province. Liquid oxygen is also being ferried,” Shankar Pokharel, Chief Minister of Lumbini Province, posted on Facebook on Wednesday morning. The Chief Minister came short of his promised efforts. Until Wednesday evening, neither of the two hospitals had received medical oxygen. Bhim Hospital had been facing a shortage of oxygen for the last few days. The health workers used the last of their supply of oxygen cylinders to buy some amount of time on Wednesday morning. Within a span of eight minutes, three Covid-19 patients at the hospital lost their lives due to a lack of oxygen supply at 10:15am. The hospital hadn’t received medical oxygen supply until Wednesday afternoon.However, the hospital administration refutes claims of a lack of oxygen being the cause of death of Covid-19 patients at the hospital on Wednesday.“The patients’ families may feel that their loved ones died due to a lack of oxygen supply,” said Shakuntala Gupta, medical superintendent at the hospital. “But the hospital had received oxygen soon after the supply ended.” “Earlier, I had informed the CM's Office, Health Ministry and local administration among all other concerned stakeholders about oxygen shortage,” he said. However, one of the health workers at the hospital, talking to the Post on conditions of anonymity, said, “Covid-19 patients, who lost their lives on Wednesday, were in need of high flow oxygen supplement. But they did not receive high flow oxygen on time. We had to see patients dying in their beds helpless and hear their families’ grief-stricken wails.”Gobind Gyawali, the administrative officer at the hospital, said the patients’ deaths took place while the borrowed oxygen cylinders were being replaced with the empty ones. According to him, the hospital borrowed 10 cylinders from Universal Teaching Hospital immediately after they ran out of oxygen supply at Bhim Hospital.“We were unable to source oxygen from a private plant 5km away as the electricity supply was disrupted for two to three hours in the morning. We informed the ministry, district administration and others about the crisis,” said Gyawali. He said the hospital has deployed 20-25 employees to take the cylinders to the plant, refill them before transporting them back to the hospital.At the Corona Special Hospital in Butwal, the scene around 4pm on Wednesday was that of chaos and suffering.The nurses at the ICU of the hospital started calling for help. Medical Superintendent Dr Rajendra Khanal, other doctors and employees rushed to the unit. The flow of oxygen through the pipes had stopped. Five patients in the ICU died in a matter of a few minutes after the supply disrupted, the hospital later told.According to a nurse deployed in the ICU, she witnessed patients gasping for breath for a lack of oxygen supply. “The patients died one after another as we had no oxygen to offer them,” the nurse told the Post.A total of 11 Covid-19 patients—five in ICU and six in the emergency unit—died at the hospital on Wednesday. According to the hospital, the deceased were between 29 to 59 years of age.“I had informed the health ministry, health directorate and Butwal Sub-metropolis about the death of five patients in the ICU as oxygen supply ended,” said Dr Bishnu Gautam, the information officer at the hospital. According to Gautam, there is oxygen supply enough for only 13 of the total 32 patients kept in the High Dependency Unit beds at the moment. “Six oxygen cylinders have been supplied to the ICU by Wednesday evening. We have another 15. We can’t guarantee our patients’ lives. The situation has gone out of our hands,” said Gautam.According to him, six patients died in the emergency unit of the hospital on Wednesday morning as the hospital failed to manage medical oxygen for them. “It is painful to inform the concerned authorities through media, social networking sites time and again. We hope to resume oxygen supply by Wednesday evening but there is no guarantee,” he said. When oxygen supply ran out at Universal Teaching Hospital in Bhairahawa, on Tuesday, they had issued a notice warning the lack of oxygen might even lead to the death of the admitted patients. The hospital had asked for oxygen from Chitwan to alleviate the shortage till Wednesday afternoon. The hospital issued a notice a second time the next day requesting the patients and their relatives to manage medical oxygen as the hospital would run out of oxygen supply after 4 pm. As soon as the cylinders began emptying on Tuesday, doctors and nurses had called various places for support. According to the teaching hospital, it had oxygen supply till Wednesday evening after the local industry provided some cylinders.According to the Public Relations Officer Sushil Gurung the shortage of oxygen had exacerbated as the three oxygen gas industries in the district have not been able to supply cylinders to the hospital.“We have an agreement to supply 120 cylinders from Shankar Oxygen Pvt. Ltd., 150 cylinders from Lumbini Oxygen Pvt. Ltd. and 150 cylinders from HO Oxygen Pvt. Ltd.,” Gurung said. “We reached the district administration office on Tuesday night after the problem escalated but we didn’t get any response from them and the hospital started collecting 200 oxygen cylinders from Chitwan.”“We had called the Home Ministry and asked them to send us oxygen cylinders. 190 cylinders arrived in the morning,” said Gurung. Shankhar Oxygen industry also provided 40 cylinders, he said. In the last 24 hours, 16 people have lost their lives in different hospitals of the district. The district reported 771 positive cases on Wednesday. The active cases in the district stand at 7,002.","Published at : May 12, 2021",Rupandehi,Sanju Paudel						 &
Shortage of oxygen at Nepalgunj Medical College Teaching Hospital in Kohalpur,"On Monday, Nepalgunj Medical College Teaching Hospital in Kohalpur admitted new Covid-19 patients after the arrival of a tanker carrying liquid oxygen from Jamshedpur, India. However, the quantity of the liquid oxygen is not sufficient to meet the needs of the hospital, according to the hospital administration.A lack of oxygen cylinders has posed another challenge in the management of oxygen supply at the hospital, which currently has 143 Covid-19 patients. Among them, 42 patients are admitted to the Emergency Ward of the hospital.The hospital currently consumes 14 full oxygen cylinders per hour, said Dr Dinesh Shrestha, deputy director at the hospital. “The liquid oxygen, which was brought to the hospital on Sunday, is not sufficient. Every 15 days, a tanker of liquid oxygen is needed. The treatment of coronavirus-infected patients will be affected if the supply gets disrupted.” “The virus infections are on the rise and so are the Covid-19 patients seeking treatment at the hospital,” said Shrestha. “The hospital is facing a shortage of oxygen cylinders. We have asked for help from the local administration to search for oxygen cylinders used in factories and by patients at home.” Nepalgunj Medical College Teaching Hospital has built a 300-bed Covid-19 unit. The hospital, which has an oxygen liquid tank with a capacity equivalent to store that of 1,800 cylinders, has asked the government to arrange for an additional supply of oxygen to run the unit. There are two oxygen plants in Nepalgunj with the capacity of producing 1,100 oxygen cylinders on a daily basis. Among them, Bheri Hospital takes 500 cylinders and Nepalgunj Medical College consumes 200 cylinders.The Nepalgunj-based plant supplies oxygen to Surkhet, Dhangadhi, Dang, Bardiya, Tikapur, Humla and Jumla. Since the past week, Nepal Medical College has stopped admitting Covid-19 patients citing oxygen shortage. The hospital now plans to add 28 more beds for the treatment of Covid-19 patients. So far, 1,476 Covid-19 cases have been reported in Kohalpur Municipality alone since April. Currently, 939 Covid-19-infected individuals are staying in home isolation due to a lack of beds and sufficient oxygen supply in hospitals. Seventeen individuals have died of Covid-19 in Kohalpur, according to the record of the health section of Kohalpur Municipality. The municipality has built a 50-bed isolation centre and a 25-bed hospital with oxygen supply. Geharaj Khanal, corona focal person of Kohalpur Health Section, said, “The municipality has started providing home isolation services to Covid-19 patients. Those in home isolation will receive free medical treatment and emergency medical supplies during their isolation period.”","Published at : May 11, 2021",Nepalgunj,Thakur Singh Tharu						 &
No-confidence motion filed against Lumbini chief minister for second time,"As many as 40 Provincial Assembly members from the Nepali Congress, Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre), Janata Samajbadi Party and Rastriya Janamorcha registered a no-confidence motion against Lumbini Chief Minister Shankar Pokharel on Sunday.This is the second time a no-confidence motion against him has been filed. Nineteen members of the Nepali Congress, 18 of the Maoist Centre, two of Janata Samajbadi and one of Rastriya Janamorcha have signed the motion. The parties have proposed Maoist Centre leader Kul Prasad KC as the new chief minister.The proposal, which also demands a special session of the Provincial Assembly, has been registered according to Article 188(4) of the constitution. As per the Article, one-fourth of the total members of the Provincial Assembly members may table in writing a motion of no-confidence against the chief minister.The opposition has claimed that the government formed by Chief Minister Pokharel as the largest party of the Assembly as per Article 168(1) of the constitution is not valid. According to Article 168(1) of the constitution, the provincial chief shall appoint the parliamentary party leader commanding a majority in the Provincial Assembly as the chief minister, and the Provincial Council of Ministers shall be constituted under him or her.After the resignation of two state assembly members and one member switching parties, the UML only has 38 members in the existing 81-member assembly.Earlier on April 20, 41 members of the Provincial Assembly had signed a no-confidence motion in the state assembly against Pokharel. Accordingly, the state chief Dharmanath Yadav had called a special session of the assembly on April 4. But before that Chief Minister Pokharel resigned from the post on the same day.But Pokharel was re-appointed as chief minister as he was the Parliamentary Party leader of the party commanding a majority in the Provincial Assembly.","Published at : May 9, 2021",Kathmandu,Post Report
"With hospitals occupied, Covid-19 patients are dying at home","On Monday evening, a 69-year-old man of Khajura Rural Municipality Ward No. 2 in Banke complained of difficulty in breathing. He died on his way to a hospital in Nepalgunj the same night.The man had stayed in home isolation after testing positive for Covid-19 on Sunday. Since Bheri Hospital in Nepalgunj and Nepalgunj Medical College Teaching Hospital in Kohalpur were fully occupied, he chose to self-isolate at home. His family took him to the hospital for treatment only after his condition worsened.Another 55-year-old Covid-19-infected man in Ward No. 3 of Khajura, who had stayed at an isolation centre of Khajura Rural Municipality, died on Saturday. Family members of the deceased say he died for want of treatment at the isolation centre. After showing symptoms similar to that of Covid-19, the man had been taken to Nepalgunj-based Teaching Hospital for treatment. But health workers at the hospital did not admit the patient citing bed shortage, according to the family of the deceased. He was then admitted to the isolation centre on April 30.“Only two employees are on duty at the isolation centre and there are no doctors. My father did not receive proper treatment,” Anil Tiruwa, the deceased’s son, told the Post. “My father had low concentration of oxygen. He died for want of treatment.”The number of Covid-19 patients in Banke staying in home isolation has increased in recent weeks, according to health workers. As many as 3,559 patients are staying in home isolation across the district.In Nepalgunj Sub-Metropolitan City alone, currently, as many as 1,290 people are staying in home isolation, according to the City office. Of the 23 wards in the sub-metropolis, ward 10 has the highest figure with 235 people staying in home isolation. Since mid-April when the second wave of the pandemic hit the country, a total of 6,840 persons from Banke have tested positive for the coronavirus, according to the data at the Ministry of Health and Population. Almost all Covid-19 designated health institutions in Banke have been overcrowded with patients and most hospitals are reeling under a shortage of oxygen and ventilators. Health workers are overwhelmed in hospitals as patients continue to arrive. The sub-metropolis has set up an isolation centre at the White House Hotel for those with mild Covid-19 symptoms. Another isolation centre with oxygen beds has been set up at Ramlila Maidan.A 51-year-old man of Ward No. 5 in Baijanath Rural Municipality, who had stayed in home isolation after testing positive for Covid-19 on April 25, also died last week. He died while being taken to a hospital, according to family members.On April 29, a 32-year-old woman of Khajura Rural Municipality Ward No. 7 also died of Covid-19 at Bheri Hospital. She had been staying in home isolation after testing positive for Covid-19 on April 23. According to health workers at Bheri Hospital, her condition had already worsened when she arrived at the hospital six days after testing positive for the virus.Health workers of the respective local units should be deployed to inquire about the condition of those staying in home isolation. According to the health guidelines of the Ministry of Health and Population for the isolation of Covid-19 patients, health workers of the local units concerned should call or send text message to Covid patients at least twice a day to keep track of their condition.But Ram Bahadur Chand, the health unit chief at the Nepalgunj Sub Metropolitan City, said that monitoring the conditions of the people in home isolation has been difficult due to a shortage of staff.“The health workers of the respective ward office follow up on the people staying in home isolation. We refer patients to Covid-19 wards if their condition is found to be serious,” said Chand.Deputy Mayor Uma Thapa Magar of Nepalgunj said the local unit has instructed health workers to regularly inquire about the condition of people in home isolation, provide them with counselling and have them admitted to hospitals whenever needed.","Published at : May 7, 2021",Nepalgunj,Thakur Singh Tharu						 &
Hospital turning away coronavirus patients for a lack of sufficient oxygen supply,"On Monday, a coronavirus-infected woman from Chisapani in Baijanath Rural Municipality waited the whole day outside Nepalgunj Medical College Teaching Hospital in Kohalpur for admission. She was sent back home late in the evening, as the hospital did not have any beds available.For the past few weeks, hospitals in Banke have been overwhelmed with the rising number of coronavirus cases. Most health institutions are ill-equipped to handle the swelling number of coronavirus patients for a lack of supplementary oxygen, ICU beds and human resources. Banke on Wednesday recorded 591 new cases.According to Dr Devendra Acharya of Nepalgunj Medical College Teaching Hospital, the hospital has to send back at least two to three patients who come for coronavirus treatment on a daily basis because of oxygen shortage. “Some of the admitted patients have managed oxygen cylinders on their own,” said Acharya. “We haven’t even been able to admit critical patients due to limited oxygen supply at the hospital. We have no other alternative but to turn them away.” According to Basanta Gautam, coordinator of Advocacy Forum in Banke, the authorities must take responsibility for the poor health infrastructure in the district. “There are unoccupied beds at the hospital but they are sending away patients citing a shortage of oxygen,” said Gautam. “The government authorities should have managed oxygen, medical equipment and human resources on time.”Nepalgunj Medical College Teaching Hospital has built a 300-bed Covid-19 unit. The hospital has asked the government to arrange for additional supply of oxygen to run the unit. The hospital has an oxygen liquid tank with a capacity equivalent to that of 1,800 cylinders. However, the oxygen in the liquid tank has already been consumed, said Dr Suresh Kumar Kanodia, managing director at the hospital.“We have been unable to admit new patients as we are struggling to manage oxygen for the already admitted ones. So the additional beds at the hospital are empty,” he said.There are two oxygen plants in Nepalgunj with the capacity of producing 1,100 oxygen cylinders on a daily basis. Among them, Bheri Hospital takes 500 cylinders and Nepalgunj Medical College consumes 200 cylinders.The Nepalgunj-based plant supplies oxygen to Surkhet, Dhangadhi, Dang, Bardiya, Tikapur, Humla and Jumla. The demand for oxygen has also increased given the number of patients staying in home isolation who need oxygen, says Kanodia. “The 200 oxygen cylinders we get are not enough for 127 patients admitted to the hospital,” said Kanodia. “The hospital is asking suppliers in Bhairahawa, Kathmandu, Birgunj and Chitwan for oxygen.”“We won’t have to turn patients away if the government supplies sufficient oxygen,” he said. According to him, a patient with serious illness needs 2 to 2.5 oxygen cylinders per day. So Nepalgunj Medical Teaching Hospital needs 500 to 700 oxygen cylinders on a daily basis.According to Shivaram Gelal, the chief district officer of Banke, Nepalgunj Medical College Teaching Hospital has demanded more oxygen after it added 300 beds for Covid-19 patients. “In the early days, the hospital provided services with the oxygen produced in its oxygen plant. It later put in a demand for 500 oxygen cylinders to run the additional beds,” he said.While the hospital waits for additional supply of oxygen, the district administration is awaiting the centre’s response to the matter. “We have drawn the attention of the Ministry of Home Affairs to the hospital’s demand for oxygen. It’s an ongoing process,” said Gelal.","Published at : May 5, 2021",Banke,Madhu Shahi
Frontline health workers deprived of promised risk allowances,"Frontline health workers in Palpa who have been fighting the coronavirus pandemic for more than a year now say the government is yet to disburse their risk allowance. Health workers who were engaged in setting up quarantine and isolation facilities and providing treatment to Covid-19 patients last year say they feel cheated by the authorities. Giriraj Ghimire, the health unit chief of Rampur Municipality in Palpa, confirmed that none of the frontline workers have received their risk allowances.“The second wave of the pandemic is here and we need health workers to hold the fort. But they haven’t been paid last year’s dues,” Ghimire told the Post. “This year, it’s getting difficult to mobilise workers for the treatment of Covid-19 patients. They are yet to receive last year’s risk allowance. The authorities concerned have not said anything regarding the risk allowance for the current fiscal year that begins from July 16.” The federal government had decided to provide risk allowance to health workers who had been mobilised to contain the spread of the virus and provide treatment to coronavirus patients. Following the Cabinet’s decision, Rampur Municipality decided to provide 100 percent salary as allowance to frontline health workers, 75 percent to health workers in the second ring and 50 percent to other health workers mobilised for the treatment of Covid-19 patients.Almost all local units in Palpa are yet to disburse the promised risk allowance to health workers. Ribdikot Rural Municipality had also announced a 20 percent risk allowance to health workers deployed in the treatment of coronavirus patients. According to Sunil Adhikari, the health unit chief of Ribdikot, the rural municipality had announced the risk allowance in March last year but most of the health workers received the allowance for a month only.“Most health workers received the allowance for a month only. It is still not clear whether frontline workers will get the risk allowance in the current fiscal year or not,” said Adhikari. “We talked to the people’s representatives about providing allowances to health workers during the second wave as well. They are affirmative about the proposal but no official decision has been taken yet.”Likewise, health workers in Rainadevi Chhahara Rural Municipality received 50 percent of their salaries as risk allowance for a month only. “The local unit stopped issuing the allowance after a month, citing budget shortage as the federal and provincial governments did not release a budget for the same,” said Jiban Rana, the chief at the health unit. According to him, all 10 local units in Palpa—two municipalities and eight rural municipalities—have failed to provide the risk allowances of the last fiscal year.Tinau Rural Municipality, however, claims to have provided allowances to frontline health workers until mid-November. Krishna Prasad Basyal, the chairman of the local unit, said the health workers who received regular salaries from the state coffers should not expect allowances during these difficult times. “They received their salaries. That was all we could manage last year,” said Basyal. “If we get the budget for risk allowance this year, we will provide allowances to the health workers.” Most frontline health workers mobilised to contain the pandemic last year in Baitadi of Sudurpaschim Province have also not received the promised allowance. Eight out of 10 local units in Baitadi district have yet to provide risk allowances to the health workers. Only Dasharath Chand Municipality and Shivanath Rural Municipality have provided the allowances.Suresh Sarki, a health assistant at a health post in Pancheshwar Rural Municipality-1, says he did not receive any risk allowance last year despite working in the frontline for months. This year too, he has been deployed in the treatment of Covid-19 patients but says he has no expectations from the government.“They did not pay us the promised allowance last year, so we don’t expect them to pay us this year either,” Sarki said. Meanwhile, the local representatives claim that they could not provide the risk allowances to health workers because the government—both federal and provincial—had not issued the funds for it.“Since we could not provide the health workers with risk allowances last year, we feel uneasy deploying them to the frontline during the second wave,” said Hari Singh Dhami, the chairman of Sigas Rural Municipality.(Tripti Shahi contributed reporting from Baitadi)","Published at : May 4, 2021",Palpa,Madhav Aryal
What’s it like to be a health worker in a pandemic? Bheri Hospital nurses and doctors share their stories,"Preeti Khadka, a staff nurse at Nepalgunj-based Bheri Hospital, had her night shift on Friday. She didn’t feel like clocking in. She was feeling a bit under the weather. She was on her period too. The thought of putting on her Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and working her shift made her feel sicker. But she persevered.She, along with four other staff nurses, Kamala Nepali, Sunita Sahakari, Nisha Pun and Yam Kumari Thapa, was on duty in the Covid-19 ward. One nurse is assigned to 30 to 40 coronavirus patients at the hospital given the shortage of staff. The pressure under which they work is immense, says Khadka. After a night of taking care of coronavirus patients, the nurses look forward to taking off their PPEs and resting. Each day is a new battle won. Saturday morning, Khadka, exhausted from the night on duty, had to wait a little longer to take off her PPE and get a change of clothes since the next shift workers were delayed. The nurses, exhausted from the overnight duty, threw themselves on a sofa placed just outside the ward.The photo taken that very moment found its way to social media, says Khadka.  Photo Courtesy: Dr Chandra Prasad Sahu/Bheri HospitalYam Kumari Thapa knew who took that photo. “I couldn’t open my eyes. I was so tired and we all just collapsed on the couch. Dr Chandra Prasad Sahu, who came for his check-up round, teased us and said he would take our photo,” said Thapa. “We all burst into laughter when the doctor said that.” Laughter, she says, doesn’t come easy to them these days. The health workers deployed at the Covid-19 hospital are simply overwhelmed with the massive surge of Covid-19 cases. As cases continue to soar across hospitals, health workers are themselves at high risk of getting infected. According to Bimala Acharya, an administrative staff at Bheri Hospital, more than 90 health workers have tested positive for coronavirus at the hospital in the past few weeks. Khadka, the staff nurse, said she has been commuting to and from the hospital from her house every day, as there’s no place to stay at the hospital. “I have isolated myself in my house. I stay separately from my family, fearing I might carry the virus and infect them,” said Khadka. The physical distance she has maintained from her family members is a necessity but it has left her feeling alienated. “I don’t get to see my family. I don’t remember the last time I sat with them for a meal or a laugh,” said Khadka. “At the hospital too, we are too overwhelmed by our work to even smile at each other. The only time we laugh or show happiness is when we see patients recovering from the virus.”In the photo that Dr Sahu took, Khadka can be seen leaning on the couch between two of her colleagues; she looks unwell. “I was on my period. I was sweating inside the PPE,” she said. “I had just taken a painkiller and my friends were trying to soothe me after seeing me in so much discomfort and pain.”Twenty-three-year-old Yam Kumari Thapa, who got married two years ago, is currently staying at her parent’s house in Banke. Her husband, who stays in Kathmandu, arrived at her home a few days ago. But Thapa has had no time. Neither for her family nor for her husband. “Even when I’m home with my husband, I’m busy on the phone,” she said. “We get updates on our group chat of staff nurses. We discuss our patients’ health even when we are off duty so that we can take better care of them when we get back to the hospital for our shift.” Sunita Sahakari, one of the four staff nurses on duty with Khadka, is from Kalikot. She lost her husband to blood cancer two months ago. But hasn’t been able to mourn her husband since she is one of the few health workers available for the care of Covid-19 patients at the hospital. A mother of a six-year-old son, she tested positive for Covid-19 a few days ago but is still on duty. When someone loses their loved ones to Covid-19, she is reminded of her husband. “I know what it feels like to lose someone dear to you. I empathise with the family members of the patients who don’t recover,” she said. Kamala Nepali from Dailekh says her family has been asking her to quit her job at the hospital and return home. But she’s adamant to continue with her work. She also got infected while at the hospital. “My mother is worried. She wants me to return home but I can’t leave. The patients here need me and their families depend on us to see them through this,” Nepali said. Health workers deployed in other coronavirus-specific hospitals share similar stories of suffering and hope. Dr Purushottam Barma, medical officer at Nepalgunj Medical College, has continued working at the hospital even though he’s showing symptoms similar to that of Covid-19. But he can’t take a day off since the hospital is receiving a massive flow of patients since Saturday. Two medical officers are already in home isolation after they tested positive for Covid-19 a few days ago, leaving the hospital severely short-staffed.  Dr Purshottam Barma  Photo Courtesy: Nepalgunj Medical Hospital staffA photo of Barma flipping the pages of a patient's report while being hooked on to an IV drip also found its way into various social media platforms. “I wasn’t feeling particularly well that day. I was very weak due to diarrhoea. But our work doesn’t stop even when we fall sick,” he said. “So I was going through a patient’s file while taking medicine myself when the photo was taken by a staff nurse at the hospital.” It has been around six months since Barma, a resident of Phultekra in Nepalgunj, met his friends. “We are so busy. Forget about meeting friends, we don’t even have the time to ask each other how we're doing,” he said. Shila Sharma, nursing in charge at Bheri Hospital, stays at the hospital most of the time but she frequently thinks of her two-year-old son who tested positive for the virus nine days ago. She hasn’t been able to take care of him as much as she would like to because most of her time is spent at the hospital. “He’s already asleep when I reach home late in the evening. I try to breastfeed him whenever he’s awake,” said Sharma. “His health is improving slowly.” She is looking forward to taking some time off to take care of her son, as she heard that 22 additional health workers have been deployed at the hospital. “We will have less work pressure with the additional human resources,” she said. “I will finally be able to look after my son.”","Published at : May 3, 2021",Banke,Madhu Shahi
Pokhrel reappointed Lumbini chief minister amid protests from opposition parties,"Shankar Pokhrel has been reappointed as chief minister of Lumbini. As a no-confidence motion was set to be tabled on Sunday afternoon at a special session of the Provincial Assembly, Pokhrel resigned earlier in the morning as the chief minister and prepared to stake claim to the government. He was eyeing a new wholly CPN-UML-led government in the province. After what looked like a brief glitch in his plan, when an assembly member switched sides to join the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre), Pokhrel, however, was reappointed chief minister.The appointment followed an emergency meeting of the party’s Standing Committee called by Oli in Kathmandu followed by his visit to Sheetal Niwas to hold talks with President Bidya Devi Bhandari. “Provincial Chief Dharma Nath Yadav has appointed leader of the CPN-UML Parliamentary Party of Lumbini Provincial Assembly Shankar Pokhrel as the chief minister as per Article 168 (1) of the constitution,” states a press statement issued by Chiranjibi Poudel, spokesperson of the Office of the Provincial Chief. “Earlier today, Pokhrel had presented his claim for the formation of a new government with signatures of the majority of the Provincial Assembly members.”Earlier in the day, with 41 seats with him, Pokhrel was in a bid to seek to form a new government as per Article 168 (1).But a Provincial Assembly member, Bimala Khatri, decided to remain with Maoist Centre, thereby making Pokhrel one short of a majority in the existing 81-member assembly. Despite that Provincial Chief Yadav reappointed Pokhrel as per Article 168 (1), raising many an eyebrow.UML’s Provincial Assembly members, however, say Bimala Khatri used to attend the UML’s Parliamentary Party meetings and has her signatures in the minutes, hence her last-minute decision to switch the party does not count. “She changed the camp just today. We have evidence to show she has attended the UML’s Parliamentary Party meeting after the Nepal Communist Party (NCP) was invalidated,” Rewati Raman Sharma, a UML Provincial Assembly member, told the Post. “Pokhrel got reappointed as we have 41 assembly members with us.” Khatri was elected to the Provincial Assembly on the Nepal Communist Party (NCP) ticket from Dang Constituency 3 (B) in a by-election held on November 30, 2019. The Nepal Communist Party (NCP) was invalidated by the Supreme Court on March 7 and its constituent parties–UML and the Maoist Centre–were revived.In a press statement issued on Sunday, Khatri said she decided to be with the Maoist Centre.On April 19, 41 members of the Provincial Assembly–19 of the Nepali Congress, 17 of the Maoist Centre and five Janata Samajbadi Party–had registered a no-confidence motion against Pokhrel, proposing Maoist Centre leader Kul Bahadur KC as the next chief minister.They had also demanded a special session of the Provincial Assembly. But hours after the motion was registered, Pokhrel had inducted four Janata Samajbadi Party members into Cabinet. Of the four members inducted as ministers, three had signed the no-confidence motion.All four were expelled by the Janata Samajbadi Party as members of the Provincial Assembly on April 29.In the 2017 elections, the Nepali Congress had won 19 seats, Maoist Centre 20, Janata Samajbadi six and Rastriya Janamorcha one seat.The Maoist Centre’s two members and Janata Samajbadi’s four members are suspended. With a Maoist Centre member holding the post of Speaker, the party has 17 seats in the assembly.Pokhrel’s appointment came minutes before the parties that filed the no-confidence motion were planning to stake claim to the government as per Article 186 (2), claiming that he had fallen into a minority after Khatri’s decision to join the Maoist Centre.Immediately after Pokhrel’s reappointment, Dug Narayan Pandey resigned as a UML Provincial Assembly member.“I have resigned as a [UML] party member and Provincial Assembly member on moral grounds as I failed to keep my promise to the people,” Pandey told the Post over the phone. Two other UML Provincial Assembly members, Ajay Shahi and Dharma Bahadur Lal Srivastav, have decided to support the opposition parties’ claim to the government with KC as the chief minister.Shahi and Srivastav, both from Kapilvastu, were elected with the “sun” election symbol of the UML. Though they identified themselves as independent assembly members, they had supported Pokhrel when he was elected chief minister in February 2018 with the support of the Maoist Centre. “We were not UML members, but yes, we did attend UML meetings. We identified ourselves as an independent group,” Srivastav told the Post over the phone. “We want to make it clear that we don’t support Pokhrel as chief minister.” After Pokhrel was re-appointed chief minister, as many 42 members of Nepali Congress, Maoist Centre, Janata Samajbadi Party and Rastriya Janamorcha besides Shahi and Srivastav have reached the office of the provincial chief and demanded him to stop the oath-taking ceremony as they have the majority. “We have different options even if the provincial chief refused to change his decision, Pokhrel will have to take a vote of confidence within a month,” said Dama Sharma, a Provincial Assembly member from the Maoist Centre. “We can also call for another special session which should be called within 15 days.”In the evening, amid sloganeering by opposition members of the assembly, Provincial Chief Yadav administered the oath of office and secrecy to Pokhrel.Constitutional experts have said the way Lumbini province today re-appointed Shankar Pokhrel as the new chief minister even after losing the majority was nothing but a farce and against the spirit of the parliamentary governance system. “Oli had to take a vote of confidence within a month after the court divided the ruling party. So there must be a malafide intention in his abrupt decision to seek a vote of confidence when the pandemic is becoming uncontrollable,” said Chandra Kanta Gyawali, a constitutional expert. “He has no justification now as the Maoist Centre has not withdrawn support, as he was saying he still enjoys a majority.”According to political economist Roka, Oli has become weaker but still, he wants to damage the political system by not allowing time for the new government to bring policy and programmes and the budget as stipulated by the constitution. “If he was honest he should have sought the House confidence long ago,” said Roka. “But now he is doing it after provincial governments are gradually losing grounds.”","Published at : May 2, 2021",Kathmandu,Tika R Pradhan
Pokhrel’s bid to form UML-led government in Lumbini meets with obstacles,,,,
Lumbini Chief Minister Pokhrel resigns to dodge no-confidence motion,"Lumbini Chief Minister Shankar Pokhrel, a close confidante of CPN-UML chair and Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, resigned on Sunday morning to dodge a no-confidence motion against him and stake claim to a government under his leadership without the support of any other party. His resignation was approved almost immediately by Lumbini Provincial Chief Dharma Nath Yadav.“The Office of the Provincial Chief has already approved Chief Minister Pokhrel’s resignation,” Chiranjibi Poudel, personal secretary of the Provincial Chief Yadav and spokesperson at the chief’s office, told the Post over phone. “A notice regarding approving Pokhrel’s resignation has already been issued.”A press statement issued by the Office of the Provincial Chief said Provincial Chief Dharma Nath Yadav has accepted the resignation of Chief Minister Shankar Pokhrel as per Article 169 (1) (a) and asked Pokhrel to lead the existing Council of Ministers until a new arrangement is made as per the constitution.Pokhrel now is set to seek to form government under his leadership as per Article 168 (1) of the constitution, which says: “The provincial chief shall appoint the leader of the Parliamentary Party commanding a majority in the Provincial Assembly as the chief minister, and the Provincial Council of Ministers shall be constituted under his or her chairpersonship.”He was elected chief minister in 2018 as per Article 168 (2) of the constitution, with the backing of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre).The 87-member Provincial Assembly currently has only 81 members, as two Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre) members and four Janata Samajbadi Party members remain suspended. Pokhrel’s CPN-UML party had won 41 seats in the 2017 elections. A couple of members are said to be with the Madhav Nepal faction.In the 2017 elections, the Nepali Congress had won 19 seats, Maoist Centre 20, Janata Samajbadi six and Rastriya Janamorcha one seat.With two members suspended and one member elected Provincial Assembly Speaker, the Maoist Centre currently has 17 seats.On April 19, 41 members of the Provincial Assembly–19 of the Nepali Congress, 17 of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre) and five Janata Samajbadi Party–had registered a no-confidence motion against Pokhrel. They had also demanded a special session of the Provincial Assembly. But hours after the motion was registered, Pokhrel had inducted four Janata Samajbadi Party members into Cabinet. Of the four members inducted as ministers, three had signed the no-confidence motion.All four were suspended by the Janata Samajbadi Party as members of the Provincial Assembly on April 29.As demanded by the opposition parties, the Provincial Assembly was set to convene a special session where the no-confidence motion would have been tabled.Had Pokhrel not resigned, the Madhav Nepal faction was expected to have crossed the floor during the voting on the no-confidence motion, thereby leading to the fall of his government.Pokhrel, however, seems to have pulled off a coup by tendering his resignation, which helped him avoid the no-confidence motion.“For now the game is over. Pokhrel will form a new government under 168 (1) and his government will remain unless a situation arises for him to prove his majority in the assembly,” said Khimlal Devkota, a central committee member of the Maoist Centre who is also an advocate.","Published at : May 2, 2021",Kathmandu,Tika R Pradhan
Wildfire in Rolpa destroys 25 houses,"As many as 25 houses have been destroyed in a wildfire at Triveni Rural Municipality of Rolpa district. A wildfire has been raging on at a community forest in Nuwagaun since Monday. The fire entered the nearby settlements destroying several houses and properties on Wednesday.Chief District Officer Nawaraj Sapkota along with the chairman of the rural municipality had reached the incident site to take stock of the situation. According to DSP Naresh Raj Subedi, who had also reached the incident site all 25 houses have burnt to the ground. The local people's efforts to douse the fire were unsuccessful.“Strong winds hampered our efforts to douse the fire,” said Ishwori Gharti Magar, a local resident. Forty structures including houses and animal sheds have been completely destroyed by the fire. According to the police, the fire is spreading towards the neighbouring Runtigadhi Rural Municipality. “The fire has spread across 200 hectares of land destroying drinking water pipelines and electricity wires as well,” said police. Meanwhile, personnel from Nepal Army, Armed Police Force and Nepal Police have been deployed in the area to bring the inferno under control and for rescue efforts. “At least 100 households in Hyang, Kareti, Gunam, Sakhi and Sarpal villages are at the risk of getting caught in the fire if it is not brought under control soon,” a local journalist Pahalman Ghartimagar told the Post.","Published at : April 28, 2021",Rolpa,Kashi Ram Dangi
High risk of Covid spread in absence of quarantine centres,"Hira Singh Nepali, 45, returned from India on April 15 via Belahiya border point in Bhairahawa. He reached his home in Chhatrakot Rural Municipality-3, Gulmi, the same day. A few days later, he tested positive for the coronavirus. The migrant worker died at home on Saturday.Thousands of migrant workers returning to Nepal from India via various border points in Lumbini Province are making their way home to different cities and villages across the country. Unlike last year when the local and district governments in Lumbini Province had made quarantining mandatory for returnees, this year there are no such provisions. Bhim Bahadur BK, along with his friends, returned to Madane Rural Municipality in Gulmi from Gujarat on Friday. This was the second time BK had returned to Nepal amid the coronavirus pandemic. His recent experience was starkly different from last year’s, he says. “I reached home on Friday. Nobody asked me anything so I came home,” he said. “Last year I stayed at a quarantine facility set up in a local school for 14 days when I returned home. This year no such arrangements have been made.” The district administration office in Gulmi admits that none of the 12 local units in the district has established quarantine and isolation facilities this year. According to Rudradevi Sharma, the chief district officer of Gulmi, returnees from India are advised to stay in home isolation for 14 days after reaching their villages. That is the extent of precautions the district administration has adopted this year. “We have been asked to isolate at home. I plan to get tested for coronavirus if I start showing symptoms in the next few days,” BK said. Last year, people entering Nepal through various border points were quarantined for two weeks in the public buildings of their respective districts. They could go home only after completing their quarantine stay. The provincial and local governments were heavily criticised then for the poor management at the border points and quarantine facilities that caused the rapid spread of the disease. Following the criticism, the provincial and local authorities started keeping a record of entrants with their address and sent them to their respective local units. The local units had managed separate bus services to ferry the returnees to their towns and villages. However, the authorities this time have yet to take concrete steps to prevent the virus from spreading. The returnees are taking passenger buses home, which has increased the risk of community transmission of the disease. There are 10 local units in Kapilvastu. But not a single local body has managed quarantine and isolation facilities so far. “The local unit is not concerned about a possible outbreak of Covid-19. Returnees are freely roaming around the settlement,’ said Anup Kumar Chaudhary of Shivaraj Municipality, Kapilvastu. In Palpa, a 32-year-old man returned home to Rambha Rural Municipality-3 from India a week ago. He reached home directly without undergoing any tests since he did not show any symptoms of coronavirus. He stayed with the family and mingled with the local people. However, his PCR test came positive for Covid-19 a few days ago and he’s now in home isolation. No contact tracing efforts have been made so far.Deugir Village in Mathagadhi Rural Municipality, Palpa has been sealed after nine people tested positive for the virus. “PCR tests need to be conducted on more than 500 people who were in contact with the infected people. We have asked people not to come out of their homes,” said Keshav GC, the health unit chief of the local unit. The situation is also similar in Rolpa, Arghakhanchi, Bardiya and Rukum (East) of Lumbini Province. The returnees gather with family members and villagers without following health security protocols. Unlike last year, the local units seem indifferent to set up quarantine and isolation facilities to contain the virus.“The local units have not managed quarantine and isolation facilities this year. People returning from India and some of those who test positive for the virus are asked to go home. The settlements are at high risk of virus spread. The mayor, chairman and other people’s representatives are ignoring the possible threat,” said Pashupati Mani Tripathi, a resident of Kapilvastu Municipality-2.(Manoj Paudel in Kapilvastu, Kamal Panthi in Bardiya, Kashiram Dangi in Rolpa and Hari Gautam in Rukum-East contributed reporting)","Published at : April 26, 2021",Palpa & Arghakhanchi,Madhav Aryal						 &

Tamang said that the odd-even rule will help in controlling the spread of the virus. “We would not rule out a lockdown if coronavirus cases keep increasing,” said Tamang.","Published at : April 25, 2021",Tilottama,Sanju Paudel
Hospitals across Lumbini overwhelmed with increasing Covid-19 caseload,"On Friday, Geeta Chand from Nepalgunj was at a restaurant outside Bheri Hospital, placing an order for a bowl of lentil soup for her husband who is admitted at the hospital for Covid-19 treatment. She has been staying by her husband’s side for the past few days as his attendant.“I share the sleeping space on the floor of the Covid-19 ward with other patients. I may be infected too. I don’t know,” said Chand. “But I’ve decided to stay here with my husband because there is no one else at the hospital to look after him.”Nepalgunj-based Bheri Hospital is one of the designated corona treatment centres in Banke. With the number of Covid-19 cases on the rise in the district, the hospital is bursting at the seams. Chand says the staff at the hospital has not been particularly proactive in providing medical attention to Covid-19 patients. “Staff nurses at the hospital rarely come to the ward to check on patients. That’s why most patients here are accompanied by their family members,” she said. “On Tuesday, one of the patients was asking for water. He didn’t have any attendant to look after him. He died the same day. The past few days have been heartbreaking for me.”Dirgha Bahadur Tiruwa, the attendant of another Covid-19 patient at the hospital, says he too has been sleeping on the floor at the Covid-19 ward. His brother is currently admitted to the Intensive Care Unit. “We have to request the doctors to come for medical rounds. It’s chaos here,” he said. Dr Rajan Pandey, one of the doctors at the Bheri Hospital, says the hospital is at a breaking point with a limited number of medical staff, affecting their response time to individual patients. “We have one nurse assigned to more than 60 patients. We are stretched thin,” he said. “The situation in Nepalgunj has gone out of control.”The hospital currently has the capacity to supply oxygen to just six patients while there are more than 100 patients who need to be placed in immediate ventilator support, says Pandey.The hospital needs an additional 10 nursing staff, 10 anaesthetists and 20 helpers immediately.“We have been requesting the provincial and federal governments to manage human resources for the hospital but no arrangements have been made so far,” Pandey said.On Thursday, two health workers, who were deployed at the Covid-19 ward of Bheri Hospital, tested positive for the virus but the hospital administration could not make arrangements for their treatment either. “We should’ve been able to help frontline workers but we are helpless. I can understand the frustration of patients and their family members but there is very little we can do unless the authorities step in,” he said.Bheri Hospital has a total of 142 isolation beds, 35 ICU beds and seven ventilators. “All of those beds and ventilators are occupied,” said Pandey. According to him, over 80 percent of people who underwent Covid-19 tests in the last few days have tested positive for the virus. The overwhelming percentage of patients seeking admission at the hospital has crippled the medical infrastructure. People have to wait long for their chance at securing a bed in the hospital’s Covid-19 ward. A new patient is admitted only after the recovery and discharge of another Covid-19 patient.On Thursday night, a woman from Barbardiya in Bardiya district had to wait for five hours to get admitted to the Covid-19 ward. “I had no option but to wait. Thankfully, one patient got discharged and I was admitted,” she said. “Around a 100 people are testing positive for Covid-19 on a daily basis. All 142 isolation beds at the Covid-19 ward are occupied. The situation is beyond control. There isn’t much we can do until we get help from all quarters,” said Dr Prakash Thapa, the medical superintendent at the Bheri Hospital. “We feel helpless for being unable to treat every patient who comes to the hospital.”On Thursday, 388 people tested positive for Covid-19 in Banke district. Ranjha-based White House Hotel building was converted into an isolation centre the previous day. According to the District Health Office in Banke, over 1,000 Covid-19 patients are staying in home isolation. Bheri Hospital and Nepalgunj Medical College Teaching Hospital are the only two Covid-19 designated hospitals in the district as of now. “There have been demands from all quarters to rope in other hospitals to accommodate the growing number of Covid-19 patients in the district,” said Pramod Dhital, chairman of Bheri Hospital Development Committee. “That would come as a huge relief for the medical fraternity and for the public.”A similar scenario is playing out in another district of Lumbini Province. At the Corona Special Hospital in Beljhundi, Dang, 42 Covid-19 patients are receiving treatment at the 35-bed hospital. According to Dorna Oli, manager of the hospital, the hospital administration has been turning away Covid-19 patients for a lack of beds and other necessary medical equipment. “Five patients are admitted to the ICU while the remaining 37 have been administered with medical oxygen,” said Oli. “We cannot take in any more patients.”Around 17 to 20 Covid-19 cases are being reported in Dang on a daily basis. Currently, Bhim Hospital in Bhairahawa, Rupandehi, is also filled to the brim. The 25-bed hospital is unable to admit new patients. On Friday, 227 individuals tested positive for Covid-19 in the district. “All 13 ICU beds and four ventilators at our hospital are occupied. There are seven other patients in the fever clinic as well. The Covid-19 caseload is increasing by the day across the province. We need immediate support from all quarters before the medical infrastructure comes crashing down,” said Dr Sudarshan Thapa, a physician at the Corona Special Hospital in Butwal.(With inputs from local correspondents in Lumbini Province)","Published at : April 23, 2021",Banke,Madhu Shahi						 &

67 vultures found dead in Parasi,"As many as 67 vultures of various species were found dead at Jitpur of Ramgram Municipality Ward No. 4 in Nawalparasi (West) on Wednesday. The rare birds were found dead near a local pond.According to Bharat Kafle, chief at the district livestock service expert office in Nawalparasi (West), 33 white-rumped, 31 himalayan griffon, two cinereous vultures and one slender-billed vulture were found dead on Wednesday. Investigation is underway to find the cause behind the death of those vultures, said Kafle. “One himalayan griffon was found ailing in the area. The bird is undergoing treatment at the moment,” he said.Meanwhile, the remains of two dogs were found where the vultures were lying dead. The carcasses of two other dogs were also recovered in a sack nearby. “Preliminary investigation shows that the vultures died after preying on the bodies of the dogs who were probably poisoned to death,” said Deu Bahadur Rana, the project officer at Conservation Bird Nepal. “Sample collected from the incident site will be sent to Kathmandu for further lab tests.” “We were shocked to find dozens of dead vultures lying on the ground. It is extremely bad news for bird conservation in Nepal,” said Shambhu Prasad Upadhyay, a local resident. The local people suspect that the dogs had been fed poison-laced food. The municipality, however, said it was unaware of the killing of the stray dogs. “The local unit has not launched any programme to manage stray dogs. We do not know who was involved in the poisoning of the dogs. The police should investigate into the case,” said Rajesh Panthi, the chief administrative officer of Ramgram Municipality.The government and various organisations, in their efforts to conserve the vulture population, have launched various conservation programmes. Vulture ‘restaurants’ were set up in several places where the birds could feed on safe carrion to increase their number. Similarly, a vulture conservation and breeding centre was established in Kasara in the Chitwan National Park in 2008.“The death of 67 endangered vultures is a huge loss for vulture conservation. Proper investigation and study should be conducted to avert such a tragedy in the future,” said DB Chaudhary, a bird conservationist. “Sixty-seven vultures died on the spot where they fed on the dog carcasses. Some others that flew away after feeding the carcasses might be lying dead in other places.” According to conservationists, a wake of vultures might have flown to Jitpur from Nawalparasi—both east and west—Rupandehi and Kapilvastu, among other neighbouring districts, after sensing carrion and possible feed in Jitpur. The vultures, conservationists say, travel as long as 100 km—sometimes even longer distance—from their base in search of food.White-rumped vultures, locally known as dangar gidda, are critically endangered scavenging birds. They are the smallest among the nine vulture species found in Nepal. Their population in South Asia dwindled sharply during the 1990s due to diclofenac poisoning. The anti-inflammatory drug used to treat livestock found its way into the body of the birds that feed on carcasses and resulted in kidney failure, studies show.The population of white-rumped vulture has been gradually increasing after the government banned the production, sale and use of the drug in 2006. Around 2,000 white-rumped vultures are believed to roam Nepal’s skies at present.Conservationists say vultures are helpful in containing outbreaks of cholera, rabies, plague, anthrax and other diseases, as they feed on putrid carcasses that could spread pathogens.Nine species of vultures are found in Nepal. Four species—white-rumped vulture, slender-billed vulture, red-headed vulture and Indian vulture—are listed as critically endangered while Egyptian vulture is listed as endangered. Three other species are listed as near threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.","Published at : April 21, 2021",Parasi,Nabin Paudel

Meanwhile, Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City has decided to close all educational institutions until May 14. “All in person classes from Nursery to Grade 12 have been stopped,” reads a statement released by the sub-metropolis. “Institutions can opt for alternative ways to conduct classes.”The sub-metropolis has also halted the basic level examinations of grade 8 and other pre-scheduled examinations until the said period.","Published at : April 21, 2021",Nepalgunj,Rupa Gahatraj
Siddhartha Highway in dilapidated state,"Travelling along the Dobhan-Chidiyakhola section of the Siddhartha Highway has been made difficult due to the poor road condition.Visibility along the 5km road section is low due to dust clouds kicked up by passing vehicles. There are also several potholes and slippages along the section, making travel difficult for drivers and pedestrians alike.“We have been travelling along the dusty road for months,” said Yadav Neupane, a motorcycle rider from Kaligandaki Rural Municipality in Gulmi.Local residents say the road condition deteriorated further after the Butwal Drinking Water Project dug a roadside canal and installed pipes using excavators. “Three to four excavators are being used to dig the road section. This has caused traffic congestion along the dusty road,” said Neupane.According to the agreement of the Butwal Drinking Water Project and the Division Road Office in Palpa, pipelines should be installed without disrupting the roadside canals. “Two-way traffic movement has been blocked after the project contractor violated the agreement and installed pipelines along the canal,” said Mukunda Adhikari, division road officer in Palpa. Shyam Rana, a driver who regularly travels along the Butwal-Tansen road, said that the two-hour drive from Butwal to Tansen now takes at least five hours.According to the data of the District Traffic Office in Palpa, more than 1,000 trucks carrying limestones pass the road on a daily basis. “Various road sections have caved in due to last year’s landslides. Two-way traffic flow has been blocked in these areas,” said Krishna Khanal, a bus driver.According to the Division Road Office in Palpa, road sections at Kadambas, Siddhababa, Damsite, Paithedanda, Bhutkhola, Jhumsa, Panimil and Chaubismile, among other areas, were damaged during last year’s monsoon.In August last year, the Division Road Office had awarded the contract to Prakriti-Dhulikhel JV for the repair of the road section between Dovan to Chidiyakhola. “But the contractor has not started any work yet. We have been requesting the contractor to start repair works soon,” Adhikari, the division road officer.Every year, the Department of Roads allocates over Rs 50 million for Siddhartha Highway road repairs only. But the road section along the Siddhababa area regularly sustains damages due to huge boulders rolling down nearby cliffs during the monsoon season. Siddhartha Highway is one of the shortest highways to connect Tarai with the hill districts. It covers 120 kilometres from Sunauli, the Indian border point, to Pokhara.Over 5,000 vehicles from Sunauli, Butwal, Bhairahawa, Gulmi, Palpa, Syangja, Kaski, Arghakhanchi, Baglung, Parbat, Myagdi and Mustang use the highway on a daily basis, according to Som Bahadur Saru, chief at Dovan Police Post. “Limestone-carrying trucks are major contributors to traffic congestion on the highway,” Saru said.Another reason for the poor state of the road is the regular operation of heavy goods-carrying trucks, says Shibu Khatri, an engineer at the Division Road Office. “In the past, lorries with more than six wheels were not allowed to run on the highway. But the Department of Roads has now allowed all types of vehicles to operate on the road. This is one of the reasons behind the dilapidated state of the road,” Khatri said.","Published at : April 21, 2021",Palpa,Madhav Aryal
"Five killed, several injured in road accident in Banke on Friday","As many as five people were killed and 37 injured in a road accident near Rohini Khola Army Barracks in Kohalpur Municipality of Banke district around 7 pm on Friday evening.

Authorities unprepared to tackle Covid-19 spike in Lumbini,"A week ago, a 31-year-old migrant worker from Gubrakot Rural Municipality Ward No. 13 in Surkhet returned home from India after falling ill. He was taken to Bheri Hospital in Nepalgunj a few days ago following complaints of shortness of breath. At the hospital, his test for Covid-19 came positive and he was moved to the ICU where he was kept on ventilator support. On Friday morning, he died while undergoing treatment for Covid-19.Six critical Covid-19 patients are currently admitted to the ICU at the hospital.According to the data of the hospital, out of 74 Covid-19 patients undergoing treatment at the hospital, 49 are in critical condition.Health officials in Lumbini Province, where 238 new cases were reported in the last 24 hours, have raised concerns about the growing number of infections in all major cities of the province. The provincial authorities, however, are yet to step up preventive measures to curb the further spread of Covid-19, they say. “Neither the provincial nor the local governments are acting promptly to avoid last year’s situation where the entire province was in the grip of Covid-19,” said Tej Oli, the coronavirus focal person at the District Health Office in Banke. “We have requested the local governments to arrange ambulances for emergency use but we are yet to hear from them.” According to him, over 200 Covid-19-infected individuals in Banke have been asked to self-isolate at home for a lack of beds in the hospitals. “We put in a request for ambulances since most Covid-19 infected are in home isolation and if their condition deteriorates, we have to act fast and take them to a hospital,” said Oli. “Bheri Hospital cannot bear the pressure alone. It’s becoming increasingly important to sort out logistics and make arrangements for ambulances, isolation facilities and more hospital beds.” Nepalgunj has seen a spike in Covid-19 cases in the past few days. District authorities in Banke say that the uptick in Covid-19 cases is mainly due to the free movement of people through Nepalgunj-Rupaidiha and other open border points in the district. “Nepalgunj is at risk of being a Covid-19 hotspot again,” said Dirgharaj Upadhyay, assistant chief district officer in Banke. “We failed to keep a check on cross-border movement. We should have tightened security at the border points to prevent free public movement.” Meanwhile, the District Administration Office has tightened the Nepalgunj-Rupaidiha border point from Friday to contain cross-border movement. Despite the measures in place, movement across other open border points continues to go unchecked. “We have set up a health desk at the border point. Covid-19 suspects will be sent directly to a hospital,” said Upadhyay.According to Dr Prakash Thapa, medical superintendent at Bheri Hospital, out of 183 swab samples collected from across the province on Friday, 127 tested positive for Covid-19. “The situation is becoming critical by the day. If the number of patients keeps on increasing, the hospital will soon run out of beds,” he said. Bheri Hospital is a 72-bed facility with seven ventilators, which doctors at the hospital say are not sufficient in light of the current caseload. According to figures provided by the Ministry of Health, 289 individuals tested positive for coronavirus in Banke district in the last three days. “There are 12 patients in the ICU beds now. If we fail to bring the number of infections under control, the hospital will be overwhelmed with Covid-19 cases in the coming days,” said Dr Sudarshan Thapa, the focal person at the Coronavirus Special Hospital in Butwal.There are 16 ICU beds at the hospital. “Of the 16 beds, three are defunct,” said Thapa. Meanwhile, Kapilvastu has reported 16 active cases as of Friday. The district had not seen a single Covid-19 case since mid-February, according to the District Health Office in Kapilvastu. But the start of April marked the resurgence of Covid-19 cases in the district. “There’s a high chance of a Covid-19 outbreak in the district but the authorities are yet to take stern measures to control the spread,” said Umesh Ghimire, the coronavirus focal person at the District Health Office.On Thursday, a meeting of the district level Covid-19 Crisis Management Committee in Kapilvastu directed the government offices to adopt necessary precautions to contain the spread of the virus. In Nepalgunj, the Covid-19 Crisis Management Committee has decided to close all schools and businesses for a week, except those offering emergency and essential services. “We have decided to shut down schools after the district saw a spike in Covid-19 cases,” said Uma Thapa Magar, deputy mayor of the sub-metropolis. Education Chief of the sub-metropolis Gorakh Bahadur Thapa informed that 14 teachers and students have tested positive for Covid-19 in various schools of Nepalgunj.","Published at : April 17, 2021",Lumbini,"Madhu Shahi						,"
Nepalgunj schools to close for a week amid surge in Covid-19 cases,"Nepalgunj sub-metropolitan city has decided to close all schools for a week from Sunday with the rise in coronavirus cases in the city.A meeting of the crisis management committee on Thursday decided to close all schools and businesses for a week except those offering emergency and essential services, said Uma Thapa Magar, deputy mayor of the sub-metropolis. “We have decided to shut down schools after an increase in the number of Covid-19 cases,” said Magar, “We had proposed shutting down schools from Friday but since everyone needed to be informed the decision will take effect from Sunday.”The meeting also decided to strictly monitor people entering Nepal through the Nepal-India border and ramp up health checkups and antigen tests. The metropolis was under pressure to take precautionary measures including closing public and private schools among others following a surge in Covid-19 cases.According to Bheri Hospital, most of the recent Covid-19 cases have been detected in teachers, students and parents. “Even though some schools are following health and safety protocols, many of them are not strictly implementing them,” said Tej Oli, the coronavirus focal person at the District Health Office in Banke. “That’s also why we are seeing a surge in infections in schools.”Education Chief of the sub-metropolis Gorakh Bahadur Thapa informed that 14 teachers and students have tested positive for Covid-19 in various schools in the city.","Published at : April 16, 2021",Kathmandu,Rupa Gahatraj
Bardiya becomes a tourist hotspot courtesy of Royal Bengal tigers,"Ranjan Sapkota of Samakhusi in Kathmandu visited Bardiya National Park for the first time in March. While there, Sapkota, accompanied by his six friends, went on a wildlife jungle safari tour, where the group spotted a tiger.“I was thrilled. It was a Royal Bengal tiger,” said Sapkota. Sapkota and his friends couldn’t believe their luck for they had a relatively easy sighting, that too on just the second day of their tour. “There was no limit to our happiness when we saw the tiger. We were excited,” he said. Sapkota and his friends weren’t the only lucky ones to spot a tiger at the park in recent days. Jayant Bhatta of Kailali saw a Royal Bengal tiger with her cub at Baghaura grassland in the western section of the park. Bhatta immediately took a picture of his sighting and posted it on social media. The photo garnered much attention and soon his friends too were making plans to visit the national park to get a glimpse of a tiger. According to tourism entrepreneurs, due to word-of-mouth recommendations and social media publicity, Thakurdwara, a village adjacent to the park which is also a tourist hotspot, has been drawing a large number of domestic tourists of late. Most of the footfall in the area is that of tourists seeking Royal Bengal tiger sightings. The park is home to endangered animals such as the Royal Bengal tiger, wild elephant, great one-horned rhinoceros and a wide variety of near-threatened bird species.Jungle safari guide Tilak BK says that about 40 percent of tourists who come to Bardiya are successful in spotting a tiger these days. “Those who see tigers on their visit to the park return home with a happy heart. Those who don’t see one also enjoy the jungle safari and sightings of other rare animals and birds,” he said.The number of domestic tourists has been increasing since the park reopened on October 17 last year after several months of closure due to the Covid-19 pandemic.On Tuesday, the eve of the Nepali New Year, hotels around Bardiya were booked to their capacity mostly by tourists on the lookout for tigers. Bardiya National Park was established in 1988 as Royal Bardiya National Park. It covers an area of 968 sq km and is the largest national park in Nepal’s Tarai, adjoining the eastern bank of the Karnali River and intersected by the Babai River in Bardiya district.The park is home to 53 mammals, including rhinoceros, wild elephants, Royal Bengal tigers, swamp deer and the Gangetic dolphins, and 542 bird species.The number of tigers has increased in Bardiya in the past few years due to suitable natural habitat, availability of prey and improved security, according to the park authorities. As per the 2018 tiger census, there were 87 Royal Bengal tigers in the park. Bishnu Bahadur Thapa, director of Sansara Safari Camp, said that domestic tourists from far east to far west are coming to the national park attracted by the prospect of sighting endangered creatures in their natural habitat.“The New Year and days leading up to it have been good for hoteliers here. Business has been picking up after nearly a year of inaction,” said Thapa. “The arrival of tourists has raised hopes for a fast recovery.”Dharmaraj Ghimire, manager at the Babai Resort in Thakurdwara, said there’s a steady flow of tourists courtesy of the tigers at the park. Bishnu Prasad Shrestha, chief conservation officer of the park, says that the tiger habitat has been opened for tourists with effect from this Nepali New Year with safety standards in place. More than 16,000 domestic and foreign tourists visited the park last year. Since the reopening of the park in October last year, the park has received 6,942 domestic tourists. Similarly, the park has received 67 people from South Asian countries and 161 from third countries, according to park officials.But the tigers that are drawing in a relatively good number of tourists to the park area have also become a cause of terror for those living in areas adjoining the park. Six people have died from tiger attacks in and around the park area this fiscal year that started from mid-July 2020, according to the park authorities.","Published at : April 15, 2021",Bardiya,Kamal Panthi

Lumbini Province sees surge in Covid-19 cases,"The Covid-19 ward at Bheri Hospital, a Nepalgunj-based hospital designated for coronavirus treatment, had only six patients two months ago. Soon, the number of active cases in Banke fell to zero and the local governments decided to close down all isolation and quarantine facilities.Now, the district in Lumbini Province is once again witnessing a surge in Covid-19 cases, raising concerns among public health officials that the district might turn into a hotspot for Covid-19 yet again. According to the District Health Office, a total of 109 Covid-19 cases were reported in the district in the past two weeks. As many as 86 people tested positive for the virus in the last three days alone.“The Covid-19 ward at Bheri Hospital was empty two months ago. But now the ward is filled with Covid-19 patients once again. If this continues, there’s a high chance of Banke turning into a breeding ground for the virus,” said Dr Prakash Thapa, chief at Bheri Hospital. “People are flouting health protocols such as wearing masks, washing hands and maintaining physical distancing in public areas and this has put the entire population at risk of contracting Covid-19.” Many people are taking the disease too lightly these days, says Thapa, but the virus still poses a serious threat to the general public. “The local authorities must set up quarantine and isolation facilities again. There are a total of 142 beds in the Covid-19 ward, 15 isolation beds and 25 beds with ventilator facilities at the hospital but that may not be enough in the coming days,” he said.The District Health Office is equally worried about the unchecked cross-border movement along the Nepal-India border in Lumbini Province. The office on March 24 set up a health desk at Nepalgunj-Rupaidiha border point given the high volume of workers returning to the country from India, where coronavirus cases are surging. According to the office, out of 124 antigen tests conducted on Nepali returnees at the health desk so far, 10 results have come positive for Covid-19. Around 500 people have been entering the country daily through the border point, but the health desk is not equipped to run antigen tests on every individual.“We cannot test all people entering Nepal due to a lack of required human resources and equipment. We run tests only on those individuals with visible symptoms. The infected people are then sent to Bheri Hospital for treatment,” said Dhirjung Shah, chief at the District Health Office in Banke. Meanwhile, public health officials in Rupandehi are concerned about the increasing number of Covid-19 cases that are being reported in educational institutions. Two educational institutions in the district have been closed after students and employees tested positive for the virus. A campus in Siddharthanagar has been closed for 10 days starting April 5, as two students tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday and Wednesday respectively. The campus carried out antigen tests of 28 students and employees later. Among them, a bus driver tested positive for the virus. All of them are now in home isolation.Dr Sudarshan Thapa, the focal person at Corona Special Hospital in Butwal, said that educational institutions should be on high alert to protect children from the second wave of the virus. “People have been ignoring health safety protocols as Covid-19 cases were not reported in Rupandehi district for many days until three weeks ago. Coronavirus cases are now increasing due to the carelessness of the people,” said Thapa. “At least two Covid-19 patients with serious symptoms are brought to the hospital on a daily basis these days.” Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City has also decided to close a secondary school for at least five days starting from Sunday, as seven teachers and employees were infected with the virus on Thursday. The teachers and employees of the school had returned after visiting various places in the country last week. According to the school administration, all the infected employees are in home isolation. There are a total of 38 community schools and 58 institutional schools in Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City.The district administration and the local government have urged schools and colleges to implement strict health safety measures. “We have notified all schools to maintain physical distancing protocols and use face masks and hand sanitisers. The students, teachers and employees should be kept in isolation in case they are found infected with the virus,” said Mitramani Khanal, the chief at the health unit of Butwal Sub-metropolis. “We might be heading towards a dire situation if immediate preventive measures are not taken. Health check-ups should be conducted on those returning from India through various border points,” said Roma Ghimire, a lab technician at Siddhartha Municipality. According to Kedarnath Sah, an officer at the District Health Office in Rupandehi, there are 86 active cases of Covid-19 in the district. As many as 65 people tested positive for Covid-19 in the last three days. A total of 9,216 people have been infected with Covid-19 in Rupandehi so far with 86 deaths.","Published at : April 13, 2021",Banks/rupandehi,Thakur Singh Tharu						 &
‘No drugs’ campaign has dismal results,"Police in Bardiya launched a ‘No Drugs’ campaign in the district two months ago. However, officials say the campaign, which was initiated to control the smuggling and consumption of drugs in the district, hasn’t been effective so far. According to the data of the District Police Office, 47 individuals were interrogated for smuggling and consuming contrabands in the last month. Among them, four were taken into custody whereas one individual has been sent to a rehab centre.Superintendent of Police Ishwor Karki said 42 drug users were handed over to their parents after counselling. “We have already organised 15 awareness programmes targeting schools, colleges and public places. Those awareness programmes were attended by 2,500 individuals,” said Karki.The District Police Office plans to make Bardiya a drug-free district. However, cases of drug smuggling and the arrest of users and smugglers in the district have shown that the campaign has not been as successful as expected.The District Police Office says it will continue with the campaign despite getting dismal results. “Most of the drug users are young people. We have been taking classes in 10 community schools in a day to raise awareness among them,” SP Karki said.Mayor of Madhuban Municipality Ganesh KC said the police campaign hasn’t yielded the expected results but it should be continued to control smuggling and consumption of drugs in the long run. According to the District Police Office, the campaign will end by the end of the current fiscal year. “The consumption and smuggling of drugs have become rampant in Bardiya due to the open border,” said Dipu Chaudhary, a civil society leader and a local resident of Gulariya Ward No. 10. “Authorities should launch awareness programmes in the settlements near the border area. The border area should also be closely monitored to control illegal trade of drugs.” According to Nara Bahadur Raut, Superintendent of Police of the Armed Police Force in Bardiya, over 12 individuals were arrested with contrabands in the last nine months. “Mostly pharmaceutical drugs are being smuggled into the country from the border point,” Raut said.","Published at : April 11, 2021",Bardiya,Kamal Panthi
Illegal extraction of riverbed materials goes unchecked in Narayani river,"Illegal extraction of riverbed materials is going unchecked in the Susta area along the Narayani riverbanks in Nawalparasi (West) for the past few months.Although extraction of riverbed materials is prohibited in Narayani river, people continue to take part in such illegal activities, with the local administration, local unit and the District Inspection Committee turning an blind eye to it. “Smugglers have been excavating riverbed materials from Narayani river, as the local unit has put a ban on collection of sand, stones and pebbles from local streams. The riverbed materials extracted from Narayani river are being transported to India illegally,” said a resident of Susta, preferring anonymity.Susta shares an open border with India. According to the Nepal-India agreement, it is illegal to extract riverbed materials from Narayani river. But smugglers have been collecting stones, pebbles and sand worth millions of rupees from the river and transporting the goods to India. “Illegal extraction of riverbed materials from Narayani has affected the repair works of Gandak dam and spurs,” said Dudhnath Gupta, chairman of Gandak River Control Struggle Committee. “We have informed the concerned authority to control smuggling in the area. But they have not done anything to stop such activities.”According to Gupta, the continuous extraction of riverbed materials can also cause the river to change its course time and again.“The rural municipality alone cannot stop the illegal extraction. Local residents, security personnel and other concerned stakeholders should take initiatives to stop such illegal activities,” said Ram Prasad Pandey, chairman of Susta Rural Municipality. “It is impossible to stay on the lookout all the time. But we are going to inspect the area and take action if necessary.” This year, the rural municipality has not conducted any inspection of the river bank area. According to the local people, smugglers are extracting riverbed materials from various areas along the river bank but the concerned authorities are staying mute.Under the Gandak agreement with India, an office has been established to coordinate various issues relating to the dam between India and Nepal. Tara Singh Thapa, an official at the office, said that the rampant extraction of riverbed materials can cause massive floods in the Gandak dam during the monsoon.“The Gandak dam has become old now. It can collapse anytime in case of flood,” Thapa said. Meanwhile, Shiva Shankar Raya, chief at the District Coordination Committee in Nawalparasi (West), says that inspection is difficult since smugglers are active mostly during the night. “The inspection team has found riverbed materials stored in bordering Ramnagar, Beduali, Bahuwar, Basiaya and Bhujahawa, among other areas. The price of riverbed materials is higher in India. That is why smugglers are transporting the extracted materials to India via boats and tractors,” said Raya.","Published at : April 4, 2021",Parasi,Nabin Paudel
"Ghorahi constructs artificial lakes, ponds to preserve ecology","Ghorahi Sub-Metropolitan City in Dang has launched a campaign to construct artificial lakes and ponds across the local unit to preserve the local ecology.The sub-metropolis aims to conserve wetlands, increase greenery, provide irrigation facilities to local farmers, preserve the habitat of various species of wildlife and birds and promote tourism with the construction of the water bodies.“A total of 22 ponds have been constructed in Ghorahi Sub-Metropolitan City so far. The ponds occupy around 33 bighas of land and have a capacity to store 2.2 million cubic metres of water,” said Ramdhan Shrestha, an engineer at the sub-metropolis. According to him, 3,500 families of local farmers have benefited from the initiative.The artificial ponds have been constructed in Chepe, Balarampur, Dundra, Thanti, Jankholi, Jyamire, Gangate, Dhikpur, Katahari, Aarogya, Dabari, Gulariya, Belghari and Githepani areas of Ghorahi. These ponds are managed by the local people, who use these water bodies for irrigation and fish farming. Boats are also operated in the ponds in Chepe and Jyamire to attract tourists. According to the local unit, it spent more than Rs 100 million on the construction and management of such ponds. “Efforts are underway to build more artificial ponds to preserve the wetlands,” said Shrestha.Local residents say the construction of artificial ponds is necessary since the natural water bodies in the area are gradually drying up.“In the past, we did not even have water to feed our cattle. Now, with the construction of artificial ponds, we have enough water to irrigate our farmland as well,” said Som Prasad Subedi, a local resident of Chepe. According to him, artificial ponds have been very helpful in preserving the local ecology. He even claimed that various birds, which were hardly seen in the past, recently visited the wetland.As many as 22 lakes and ponds have been constructed in Ghorahi Sub-Metropolitan City in the past seven years.“Rainwater is collected in the artificial ponds and lakes. Such wetlands have helped in the conservation of various bird and animal species,” said Mayor Narulal Chaudhary. He said the sub-metropolitan city came up with the idea to construct artificial water bodies to minimise the impact of climate change and provide irrigation facilities to local farmers. “Such lakes and ponds have multiple benefits. They help in the conservation of ecology and promote internal tourism as well,” Chaudhary said. “They even help in replenishing underground water.”","Published at : April 3, 2021",Kathmandu,Durgalal KC
Conservationists begin study on tiger movement and behaviour in Bardiya,"A team of conservationists has initiated a study to identify the movement and behaviour of tigers at Bardiya National Park. The team plans to install satellite collars on the big cats to trace their movement.Conservationists on Monday darted a five-year-old tiger in the Kauwabhar area with a tranquilliser and attached a satellite radio collar to it. “We will study the movement of the tiger and the way it hunts with the help of radio signals,” said Asim Thapa, the assistant conservation officer at the park. According to him, the study on the movement and behaviour of tigers began after the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation, as per a ministerial-level decision, issued permission for the study of four tigers of Bardiya and Banke Complex.“Every activity of the tiger will be monitored from the park’s headquarters in Thakurdwara. Field inspections will be conducted in accordance with the information collected through radio signals,” said Thapa.A joint team of conservationists from the department, National Trust for Nature Conservation, International Union for Conservation of Nature, Michigan State University in USA and Bardiya National Park are involved in the study of tigers along the East-West Highway. The team will also study the possible measures to reduce human-animal conflict and the road infrastructure that passes through the protected area.“Tigers cannot freely move across the highway due to heavy traffic. As a result, both tigers and people are at risk. We will recommend the government to construct over-and-under passes for the free and safe movement of tigers and other animals,” said Naresh Subedi, a wildlife expert working at National Trust for Nature Conservation.According to him, the study team will track how often the tiger crosses the highway, its body temperature, heartbeat and its behaviour. A similar study on tigers is being conducted in Banke, Bardiya, Chitwan and Parsa districts.Conservationists believe that a thorough study on the tigers’ behaviour and movement will be helpful in resolving human-animal conflict in the highway areas. “The study will help minimise human-animal conflict and preserve wildlife in protected areas,” said Rabin Kadariya, chief at the National Trust for Nature Conservation.However, the study on tigers is not immediately possible in the buffer zone of the national park where frequent incidents of human-animal conflict are being reported of late. Mohammad Kar Khan, the central member of the Federation of Community Forest Users Nepal, says it's important to carry out a similar study on tigers in the buffer zone. “Human-wildlife conflict is mostly reported from the buffer zone area. Installing radio collars on the tigers in the area should also be prioritised,” said Khan.As per the latest tiger count held in 2018, there are a total of 87 tigers in the Bardiya National Park. But conservationists and park officials estimate the number to be 125 at present. With the rise in the number of tigers, human-animal conflict has also increased in the park area. As many as 17 people in Bardiya and two in Banke were killed in tiger attacks in the past two years.","Published at : April 2, 2021",Bardiya,Kamal Panthi
"Wildlife in Banke, Bardiya national parks affected as water sources dry up","Wildlife in Banke and Bardiya national parks have been hugely affected due to the drying up of water sources in the protected areas. The scarcity of water has led to more animals entering human settlements in search of water and causing human-wildlife conflict.Banke National Park, which spreads across 550 square kilometres of area, does not have perennial rivers and rivulets that pass through the protected region. “There are a few streams that pass through the park forests but water level there sharply decreases during the dry season,” said Shyam Shah, the chief conservation officer at the Banke National Park. To address the water issue, the national park a few years ago had constructed around four dozen artificial ponds in the park area. According to the park administration, there are around 100 natural and artificial water sources within the park area but almost all of them run dry during the dry season.“Wild animals from the park come out and enter human settlements due to water shortage. It is one of the reasons behind the unchecked incidents of human-animal conflict,” said Shah. Frequent road accidents involving wildlife are reported along the East-West Highway, as the animals in the park have to cross the highway to reach Rapti River, which lies in the buffer zone area.A 102-km stretch of the highway passes through the park. To avoid human-wildlife conflict and reduce the number of road accidents involving wildlife, park authorities have constructed ponds in the park area so the animals don’t have to cross the highway to reach Rapti River.Artificial ponds have been constructed in Giddhenichaur, Bikasnagar, Khadkawar and Navapratibha, among other areas of the park. “It is necessary for park authorities to manage water for wild animals all year round. Animals start entering human settlements when there’s no water source inside the park,” said Krishna Chaudhary, a conservationist in Banke. “The park should lift water from Babai and Rapti rivers to save wild animals.” Banke National Park is home to 21 tigers along with wild elephants, deer and spotted deer, among other animals.Bardiya National Park also has a similar problem. A sharp decline in the water flow in Geruwa river, an offshoot of the Karnali River a few kilometres downstream from Chisapani, has affected wildlife in the western part of the national park. “The park forest along the Geruwa river banks is the habitat of several wildlife, including tiger, rhino, elephant and spotted deer. The animals enter human settlements in the dry season, as the river hardly has any water,” said Rangilal Tharu of Geruwa Rural Municipality-4. “Wildlife menace in the area can be contained if the authorities manage water for park animals.” Over the past few years, Geruwa River has been gradually changing its course from the main stream of Karnali. As a consequence, the water flow has declined sharply, as floods in the past have deposited too much silt at Lalmatiya. The local people and conservationists are demanding authorities to channelise water in the Geruwa river by removing the siltation. Asim Thapa, assistant conservation officer of the park, however, said that the park administration is working to manage water in Geruwa River.“We have constructed 52 artificial ponds and installed 45 solar water pumps for the management of water for wildlife,” Thapa said.But locals say the park’s efforts are not sufficient. Mohammad Kar Khan, a member of the secretariat of the Federation of Community Forestry Users Nepal, said the park authorities should work more efficiently to manage water for its animals to contain human-wildlife conflict. Bardiya National Park, which spreads across 968 sq km of area, is home to an estimated 125 tigers along with rhinos, wild elephants, swamp deer and black buck, among other animals.","Published at : March 28, 2021",Banke,Thakur Singh Tharu						 &
Madhuban forests closed off to people over tiger attacks,"Madhuban Municipality has prohibited local residents from entering Khata biological corridor and Samjhana Community Forest due to the rising number of tiger attacks.On Wednesday, a 29-year-old woman of Madhuban Ward No. 3 was killed in a tiger attack. She had gone to the community forest to collect fodder. Ganesh KC, mayor of Madhuban Municipality, said his office has banned local residents from entering the forest and the biological corridor to collect fodder and firewood and graze their cattle. “The movement of tigers has increased in the biological corridor. Madhuban, which also shares a border with Bahraich, India, has a dense forest cover along the border, heightening the risk of tiger attacks,” said KC.In the current fiscal year, five individuals have already been killed in separate tiger attacks in the community forest area. “It is necessary to verify the exact number of tigers in Bardiya National Park and see if they are all being accommodated. We have also started raising awareness in the communities to minimise human-wildlife conflict. But forest and park authorities should also do more to protect the lives of people,” said KC. Camera traps have been installed in various parts of the forest after the death of the woman on Wednesday. “Eight camera traps were installed in the forest area. We are looking at ways to minimise human-animal conflict,” said Chief District Officer of Bardiya Santa Bahadur Sunar.According to the data of the park, eight people have already been killed in separate tiger attacks in Bardiya.“The park provides relief to the family of those killed in wildlife attacks. The families of those killed inside the buffer zone area are entitled to Rs 1 million as relief,” said Bishnu Shrestha, chief conservation officer at the park. “We also provide Rs 1,500 per month to single women and scholarships to the sons and daughters of the deceased.”According to the count of 2018, there were 87 tigers in the park. The residents of Bhagraiya in Ward No. 3 of Madhuban are terrorised by the growing number of tiger attacks. The villagers have stopped going out of their homes after 5pm. “We do not even walk around the village alone for fear of being eaten by tigers. Our children are not allowed to go outside alone,” said Saraswati Sah, a local resident in Madhuban Ward No. 3. Wild animals are found roaming around the Khata biological area and Katarniaghat Wildlife Reserve, say local residents. Madhuban residents do not travel along the 2km stretch of the Postal Highway from 10pm to 6am. The local administration has requested all travels be avoided on the road stretch after 6pm.The residents of Dhanaura, Kothiyaghat, Khata and Bhagraiya of Khata biological corridor in Madhuban Municipality say they are frightened to walk around the villages even during the day. “We close our doors and windows in the evening to keep wild animals out. We don’t walk out alone even during the day,” said Phularam Tharu, a local resident of Bipatapur in Madhuban Ward No. 3. “Last year, wild elephants had destroyed dozens of houses and damaged crops in Madhuban.” Three months ago, a Border Out Post of the Armed Police Force was established in Madhuban. Asmit Chauhan, police inspector of the BOP, said that the movement of tigers has increased in this area. “We have observed frequent movement of tigers here in recent days,” Chauhan said.","Published at : March 13, 2021",Bardiya,Kamal Panthi
Police in Kapilvastu develop school curriculum to raise awareness on cybercrime,"Supriya Mishra, a 10th grader at Aniruddha Public Secondary School in Kapilvastu, is learning how to use social media safely.“I am understanding about cyber crime and have started to differentiate criminal and non-criminal activities in cyberspace,” said Mishra from Baidoli in Yashodhara Rural Municipality.Keeping in view the rise in cybercrime cases of late, the District Police Office in Kapilvastu has started developing a new curriculum to aware students about cyber crime and safe internet use.The student-targeted curriculum has been launched in 80 schools of Kapilvastu Municipality and Yashodhara Rural Municipality, police said.Anita Chaudhary, a 10th grader at Kanakmuni Secondary School in Ward No. 9 of Kapilvastu Municipality, says she has learnt from the curriculum about safe internet usage.“I have even learnt how to find educational materials from the internet. This has been very helpful,” Chaudhary said.According to the District Police Office, this School Police Partnership Programme will help children be aware of risks associated with the use of the internet and protect them from such crimes.“This will eventually help the children grow into responsible citizens,” said Superintendent of Police in Kapilvastu Nawaraj Adhikari.The District Police Office has distributed textbooks to the schools. The book aims to educate students on various issues like drug abuse, smoking, alcohol consumption, cyber crime and the use of social media in a safe way.Several social issues like child marriage, withchcraft accusation, dowry system, crimes incurred on children and sexual misbehavior on children have been included in the text book. Similarly, the book gives information about legal punishment on rape conviction, criminal record system, retaliation against gender violence, drug addiction, human trafficking, cyber crime and traffic rule awareness. The safety measures to protect from snake bite and fire incidents are also incorporated in the book along with the positive and negative aspects of using social media.The book will be distributed among the students from grade 5 to grade 12. The District Police Office is planning to launch the book in all 10 local units of Kapilvastu district. “We will expand the book distribution programme to all the local units within a month. Police officers will take classes as a guest teacher if need be,” said Superintendent of Police Nabaraj Adhikari.Ramesh Pandey, principal at Anirudra Secondary School in Baidoli, expressed his hope that the book would be helpful to make a responsible citizen out of the students. “The book will be helpful in maintaining peace and security in the society,” said Pandey. “Students can prevent themselves from being a victim of various social crimes with the help of the course.”At present, the book distribution scheme is a pilot project of the police administration. The administration says the book will be further revised and distributed widely in the future.","Published at : March 11, 2021",Kapilvastu,Manoj Paudel
Grants under People’s Housing Programme insufficient,"Last year, Pabitra Pariyar of Sainamaina Municipality received a grant under the People’s Housing Programme.Pariyar’s six-member family was relieved to be moving out of the shed that they called home. But to Pariyar’s dismay, the aid afforded by the government could not cover the total construction cost of the house. According to Pariyar, the government had granted the family Rs 336,000 under the housing programme but the amount was insufficient to complete the house’s construction. Halfway through the construction work, she ran out of money and had to borrow Rs 150,000 from her neighbour to complete her house. The family has now moved out of the shed but Pariyar is facing difficulties to pay back the loan. “My husband is ill and my children are young. I do not have the means to pay back the loan to my neighbour,” she said. In 2013, the government had announced the People’s Housing Programme under which it would build houses for impoverished Dalit families. Under the programme, authorities had planned to construct 20,000 houses every year. But in the last eight years, only 20,000 houses have been constructed across the country. The programme has not met its target due to a lack of necessary budget and delay in administrative works, said Dil Bahadur Gurung, a member of the Planning Commission. In the fiscal year 2018/19, the programme initiated by the federal government was handed over to the provincial government.In Lumbini Province, 3,428 houses were constructed under the People’s Housing Programme in the last three years, according to the data of the Ministry of Physical Infrastructures Development. After the programme was handed to the provincial government, the province had permitted 7,416 families for new housing. “The beneficiaries—impoverished minorities and Dalits—should have land plots to get housing grants under the programme. But most don’t have their own land. This has led to difficulties in reaching the target of the programme,” said Sushilchandra Tiwari, secretary at the ministry.“There’s no management of budget and human resources for the programme,” Chitra Bahadur Karki, mayor of Sainamaina Municipality, told the Post. “Local units are not involved in the programme since it falls under the provincial government.”Under the People’s Housing Programme, the government had pledged to provide Rs 336,000 each to the recipient families to construct a two-room house. “The plan is not suitable for those with a large family. On the other hand, the allocated budget is not sufficient to build a house with a toilet. This is why many houses are left incomplete,” said Dhurba Dhital, contact officer of the People’s Housing Programme, also an engineer at the ministry. “Impoverished families have to take loans to complete the construction of their houses. Most of them have left their homes incomplete since they don’t have the means to pay back the loans.”The situation in Province 2 is also similar. “The federal government did not allocate a budget as per the target. We don’t even have the budget to monitor and conduct inspection” said Ramadhar Sah, secretary at the Ministry of Physical Infrastructures in Province 2. “The programme could be effective if local units were made responsible to select impoverished households and mobilise budget.”","Published at : March 11, 2021",Butwal,Amrita Anmol
Dang coal mines have become death traps,"Mohanlal Kami was crushed to death when a boulder collapsed on top of him while working in a coal mine at Ramche, Dang on Monday.The 41-year-old from Tirsang of Ghorahi Sub Metropolitan City-19 was working nearly 160 metres underground at the time of the accident. His three friends who witnessed the accident could not rescue him. Mohanlal had been working as a coal miner for the last 13 years.His wife Shanti said it was desperation that drove her husband to work as a miner. “My husband was working in the mine to earn a livelihood. The day before the incident he had been told that they found water in the tunnel. I had told him not to go but he did not listen,’ she said. Tirsang is located on a geographically remote area between the border of Dang and Rolpa districts, 21 km north from the district headquarters. The place is arid with little farming prospect. As a result most men in the village work in coal mines to support their families. “There’s no other work available in the village. We don’t have irrigation facilities here to grow crops. So most of the people work at Ramche coal mine,” said Shanti. There were 15 workers inside the mine on the day Mohanlal lost his life in the accident. “We could not do anything to save him,” said Shovakar Sunar, Mohanlal’s friend and a fellow miner.Harka Gharti, the ward chairman of Ghorahi-19, says Monday’s mine accident was a result of the company, Satya Sai Coal Industry, ignoring workers’ safety. “There are no safety measures for workers. We have been requesting the company to manage helmets, boots and other safety equipment to the workers. But the company has not paid any heed,” he said. “After the incident we have asked the company not to resume work at the mine without adopting proper safety measures.” Lumakanta Budhathoki, the in charge of Satya Sai Coal Industry, claimed that the company has adopted all safety measures and blamed the workers for not following them. “It is the workers who do not adopt the safety measures that are already in place,” he said. “We have insured all miners and taken all possible measures for their safety.” Satya Sai Coal Industry has agreed to provide Rs 500,000 to Mohanlal’s family as compensation. Miners say despite the risky nature of their job, they are not paid well. “A worker who digs a quintal of coal makes Rs 140. One can dig up to eight to 10 quintals a day. Other workers who carry coal make Rs 70 per quintal,” said Basanta BK, who works at another coal mining site at Tosa of Ghorahi Ward-19.Coal is being excavated from 12 places at Ghorahi Sub Metropolitan City and Bangalachuli Rural Municipality in Dang.At least five miners have died and four others have sustained serious injuries in the last 10 years.Although coal excavation in the district began almost 25 years ago, these mines are not being inspected or monitored. According to Mines and Minerals Rules, 1999, there should be appropriate safety measures to avoid any accident in a tunnel, well, and pits made in course of excavation of mines.According to the government policy, the District Coordination Committee in the district should inspect the mines on a regular basis. The inspection team has the right to scrap licence, stop excavation or direct necessary guidelines for excavation if found the ongoing work against the rules and standard. None of which has happened in Dang coal mines. “We are preparing to carry out field inspections soon,” said Jitendra Man Nepali, chief at District Coordination Committee, when inquired about the situation of coal mines in the district.","Published at : February 27, 2021",Dang,Durgalal KC
Industrial area plan faces backlash from former Kamaiyas and landless in Banke,"The residents of Baijanath Rural Municipality in Banke are protesting the government’s decision to set up an industrial area in the local unit. They claim that the land proposed for the industrial area has been used by freed Kamaiyas (bonded labourers) and landless people for years.Minister for Industry, Commerce and Supply Lekhraj Bhatta recently laid the foundation stone for the industrial area in Baijanath.“We are not against the establishment of an industrial area in our rural municipality. All we want is for the authorities to manage land and housing for the hundreds of impoverished families who have been staying in the area for decades. What kind of Loktantra is it to ignore the people’s problems and forcefully implement its decision?” said Subas BC, the chairman of Naubasta Industrial Area Victims’ Settlement Management Struggle Committee. Around 500 households are a part of the struggle committee.The government had announced that it would set up an industrial area in 525 bighas of land in Baijanath seven years ago. Out of the total land cover, 338 bighas are unoccupied while the remaining land is home to several settlements of freed Kamaiyas and landless squatters. The district administration, people’s representatives and local leaders claim that the dispute regarding the land has already been solved. But members of the struggle committee say they are convinced that the government will manage housing for the families likely to be affected by the project. The protesting locals demand that the authorities first manage housing for the concerned families before the industrial area is set up. Kul Bahadur Shahi of Baijanath said that the government has seized the settlements of the freed Kamaiyas and landless people in the name of industrial development. “The authorities concerned have assured the families of resettlement. But the details are yet to be discussed. The government should manage the resettlement first before beginning works on the project,” said Shahi. According to him, his family has been staying in the Naubasta industrial area since 1966.The struggle committee claims that the authorities prepared the Detailed Project Report and Environment Impact Assessment by ignoring their issue.Nautan Tharu, a 67-year-old freed Kamaiya who has been living in the area for the last three generations, is anxious about his family’s future. “The government had settled us here after our liberation. But the land is about to be seized. Where should we go now?” said Tharu.The Industrial Area Management Limited, however, claims that it will take over the land of the protesting villagers gradually. “Works will begin in the unoccupied land first. The settlements that lie in the industrial area will be resettled within six months,” said Nanda Kishwor Basnet, the chairman of the Industrial Area Management Limited. According to him, the issues of the protesting villagers will be resolved with the help of the Land Problems Resolution Commission. Basnet said the construction of the industrial area would be completed within two years at the cost of Rs 9 billion.","Published at : February 26, 2021",Banke,Madhu Shahi
Bardiya villagers build huts in community forest in hopes of getting land deeds,"Many people living near the community and national forest areas in Bardiya have started building temporary huts inside the forests after a commission was formed to distribute land to landless people. Many believe that the commission will provide them with land plots if they claim to be landless and living in the forests.The Land Problems Resolution Commission was established on March 3, 2020. Following the establishment of the commission’s district branch a few months ago, the ward offices had started to recommend the local units to keep a record of landless people. Now, more than a dozen huts have been built inside Jaya Kusumba Devi Community Forest in Gujarana, Ward No 2 in Gulariya. Those who have recently constructed huts in the forest land are the residents of nearby settlements.“We don’t really live in our temporary huts. We return home at night,” said Tiru Gujjar, a resident of Gulariya Ward No. 2, who has set up a temporary hut inside the community forest. “I own three katthas of land but it is not sufficient for my family. We are daily wage workers and need more to survive. That’s why I built a temporary hut inside the forest in hopes of receiving land from the government.”Another Nokhe Gujjar, a resident of Gulariya Ward No. 2, shared similar sentiments. Nokhe, who is also a member of the Community Forest Users Group, has included his name in the list of landless people. “Hopefully, I will also receive a plot of land,” he said.According to the Forest Consumers Committee, dozens of villagers have set up huts in the forest land in recent times. Four days ago, the Division Forest Office in Bardiya had demolished dozens of huts from the forestland only for the villagers to rebuild huts in the area.Jaya Kusumba Devi Community Forest covers 115 hectares of land. According to the data of the Division Forest Office, 68 hectares of the forestland have been encroached upon in the name of landless people.Currently, 51 individuals have built temporary huts in the forestland. Satyandra Yadav, chairman of Jaya Kusumba Devi Community Forest, said, “Those who already own houses and properties elsewhere have been constructing huts in the forest. Some of them are also engaged in selling land plots of forest illegally.”According to Mahendra Wagle, division forest officer in Bardiya, his office has been notified that some of the land mafias have been engaged in selling the forestland illegally after knowing that land plots are being distributed through the Land Problems Resolution Commission.“There are some genuine landless families who have been living in Phanta of Jaya Kusumba Devi Community Forest for over two decades. But a majority of those who have recently built huts in the forestland are not genuine landless people,” said Deepak Phadera, a local civil society leader in Phanta.Meanwhile, 53 temporary huts constructed in the name of landless victims in Neulapur, Thakurbaba Municipality Ward No. 3, were also recently demolished by the Division Forest Office.However, Bhim KC, chairman of the Land Problems Resolution Commission in the district, said that only those families staying in the public or forest land for more than a decade will receive land plots. “We are in the process to manage houses for landless people after conducting a detailed investigation. The respective ward office should provide recommendations for the landless people to receive land plots,” he said.","Published at : February 24, 2021",Bardiya,Kamal Panthi
Rukum (East) residents say they don’t have proper hospital facility,"While most district hospitals across the country are facing problems due to a lack of human resources, the district hospital in Rukum (East) has four medical officers and 49 other health workers—enough to run the 5-bed health facility.The provincial government plans to upgrade the hospital to a 50-bed facility but the upgradation process is yet to begin.Meanwhile, the health staff find themselves without much to do at the hospital, as the facility lacks medical equipment, medicines and other physical infrastructure.The Rukumkot health post situated in Sisne Rural Municipality Ward No. 5 was turned into a district hospital with the division of Rukum district into east and west in 2017. Despite it being turned into a district hospital, it still remains ill-equipped and faces a shortage of infrastructure and essential medicines.“We have enough staff with us but we are still unable to cater to the local people since we do not have the necessary equipment, medicines and other required physical infrastructure,” said Dr Purna Bahadur Pun, the medical officer at the hospital. According to him, some medical tools at the hospital have been left unused as there is not enough space to install them. “The hospital has a digital X-ray machine but it is not in use since there is no space to set it up,” he said. The hospital operates out of a building constructed for delivery services. The building also houses the Out-Patient Department, In-Patient Department and doctors’ quarters. Chief Minister of Lumbini Province Shankar Pokharel had inaugurated the hospital in November last year. After the inauguration, necessary human resources were posted to the hospital but not much was done to upgrade the physical infrastructure. The local people, who had expected quality health services with the establishment of the district hospital, complain that they can’t get treatment for even minor health problems at the institution. “The district hospital is only for the namesake. We have to go to other health facilities to receive services. The hospital is like a referral centre,” said Bikram Shahi, a local resident.Mana Kumari Budha, a resident of Sisne-4, said that she had visited the district hospital of Rukum (West) twice in the past year, as the district hospital of Rukum (East) is not equipped well. “I had consulted with the doctors there but they could not treat me since they did not have the equipment or the medicines I needed,” said Budha.The district hospital in Rukum (East) is under the provincial government. Health workers at the hospital say that the provincial government is to be blamed for the current state of the facility since it has yet to provide them with the needed medicines, equipment and infrastructure. Dr Ganesh Chaudhary, the chief at the hospital, said the provincial government had sent a few beds but they are yet to be installed since the hospital building doesn't have space. “It’s a long process but efforts are underway to manage the required medicines, tools and infrastructures for the hospital and provide quality health services to the people,” said Chaudhary.","Published at : February 24, 2021",Rukum (east),Hari Gautam
Water shortage pushing Arghakhanchi residents into hardships,"Bimala Baijali of Asurkot in Bhumikasthan Municipality-6, Arghakhanchi, has to struggle every dry season to manage drinking water for her family. This year, the scarcity of water has gotten worse with the decrease in the water level in the local springs.“We have an acute shortage of drinking water in the dry season every year. It takes hours to collect even a jar of water. We can not even grow vegetables and rear animals due to the water scarcity,” said Baulaji. According to her, the water sources in her village dry up from February until June. “We have to go from one stream to another to collect a jar of water and it takes us hours.” She and her husband had plans to start a self-sustaining agricultural venture by growing vegetables and rearing goats and cows in the village. But that plan has been put on hold for now. “My husband decided to go abroad for employment. Two of my neighbouring families also migrated out of the village because the scarcity of water does not allow us to do anything,” Baulaji said. Several settlements in the district have a similar problem. The local residents are hugely affected by the shortage of drinking water that generally starts from November and lasts till mid-June. Kamala Pariyar, 59, of Budhunamara in Bhumikasthan-5 walks for an hour every day to fetch a jar of water. “Managing water for the family is a difficult job. The springs closer to our settlements have dried up so I have to walk for one hour every day to collect water for household consumption and for domesticated animals,” said Kamala. She said she sold two goats two months ago, as it was too laborious to manage water for the cattle.The villagers, whose main profession is farming, are unable to produce vegetables and keep domesticated animals in the dry season because of the water scarcity. “Spinach, cauliflower and radish wither away for a lack of water. We don’t know how to support ourselves anymore,” said Pariyar.Chhatradev is another water crisis-hit local unit in Arghakhanchi. Bishnu Prasad Bhusal of Chhatradev-3 runs a vegetable farm on a few ropanies of land that he leased near a local stream. “I have rented land near a stream to start an agriculture farm since my settlement is crippled by a water crisis,” said Bhusal. According to him, rich families migrate to the towns and the Tarai region while the poor ones migrate towards the banks of streams due to the water crisis in the area.In the dry season, the villagers are forced to sell their cattle and buy vegetables from the markets. According to Balaram Ghimire, an agriculture officer at the Agriculture Knowledge Centre in Arghakhanchi, around 80 percent of vegetables consumed in the district are imported from the Tarai during the dry season. “Most settlements in the district face a shortage of water in the dry season. Vegetables cannot be grown, as the fields do not have irrigation facilities,” said Ghimire. According to him, even winter crops like wheat cannot be produced well in the district in the absence of irrigation facilities.“It is difficult just to manage drinking water for our families, let alone grow green vegetables in our fields,” said Bimala Shrestha of Wangla. She opines that rapid population growth is the main reason behind the water scarcity in the area. “Houses used to be scattered across settlements in the past. Now, the villages are dense because of rapid population growth. So the available sources must not be enough for the increasing population.”","Published at : February 17, 2021",Arghakhanchi,Birendra KC
Factories in Bhairahawa switch to hiring women as high male employee turnover bites productivity,"Until a few months back, Juna BK of Hadhade, Gulmi was a homemaker managing her household and looking after her child with the money her husband sent from Malaysia.But now the 25-year-old earns more than Rs24,000 per month working at Jagdamba Spinning Mills in Bhairahawa. Her husband, on the other hand, has returned after losing his job due to the Covid-19 pandemic.“I work at the mill during the day shift and my husband takes care of our child. He works during the night shift and then I take care of the child,” said BK.The couple’s combined income is more than what the husband was earning abroad.It is not just women like BK who had been a homemaker that are working at the yarn factory.Durga Basyal of Motipur in Butwal Sub-metropolitan City, Rupandehi is an undergraduate student in the third year of her degree in Education but is working at the same factory. “I decided to work to help my family financially,” said Basyal. ""I also wanted to be a skilled worker."" While women are taking home cash income, factories are benefitting too. With Nepali men opting to go abroad to work for better pay, factories like Jagdamba Spinning Mills in Bhairahawa, which has turned into an industrial powerhouse from a sleepy town in less than a decade, had been hiring Indian workers. But now, women workers have become an alternative. Nepali male workers were a problem because they would leave for greener employment pastures. Employee turnover was high. “Many male workers, after learning skills for months, abruptly quit and most of them leave for India or other foreign labour markets as they are paid higher there,” said Chiranjeevi Rayamajhi, managing director of Jagdamba Spinning Mills.Jagdamba Synthetics, another factory in the Lumbini Industrial Corridor, has been training and providing jobs for workers. But because of high employee turnover, there is always a shortage of workers, not only in this factory but others as well. In the last 14 years, Jagdamba Synthetics claims to have produced 15,000 skilled workers. But, according to the company, only about 500 workers are available, although it needs 800. It said a three-month training of each worker costs at least Rs45,000.""No matter how much we train people and make them efficient, there is always a shortage of workers,” said Ratan Acharya, manager of Jagdamba Synthetics. But factories are breathing easier as far as finding qualified employees is concerned since they started hiring women workers.“We have accorded priority to female workers as women work [more] responsibly and with sensitivity compared to men,” said Rayamajhi. “Since we started hiring women, we are not facing employee turnover like before.”Jagdamba Spinning Mill, which earlier had an average of 700 all-men workforce, now employs 130 women mostly from neighbouring Palpa, Gulmi, Arghakhanchi and Kapilvastu districts besides Rupandehi. But there are workers even from as far as Bajura in the west and Udayapur in the east.Twenty-one-year-old Juna Kumari Rokaya of Bajura in Sudurpaschim Province has been getting trained at the factory for a month now. “I don’t have anyone in my family,” said Rokaya, who has completed her high school education. “I heard that mills in Bhairahawa have been hiring women and I came here.”More than 85 percent of the women working in the spinning industry are literate. The factory produces yarn used for making men's clothing and is exported mainly to Turkey and India. It produces 30 tonnes of yarn a day. With demands for its product high, the industry operates 24/7. Managers are now thinking of having an all-women day shift. “We are also thinking of operating the entire day shift by women workers after seeing the positive changes in the industry in the last two months,” said Rayamajhi. “We need an additional 350 women workers to run the day shift.”Jagdamba Synthetics also plans to hire more women. “We have a plan to give priority to women workers like the spinning industry did,” said Acharya. ""We are planning to start with 60 to 70 women workers on a trial basis."" According to the proprietors of industrial enterprises, Indian workers still occupy a big share of the labour market in the domestic industry. But that may change in the near future.“Women arrive at work on time. They work full time,” said Rayamajhi. “They work with care as a result of which breakage of equipment and machines is at a minimum. There has been a change in the security, discipline and cleanliness in the factory as well.""Men on the other hand, according to managers of factories, are frequently absent and take a day off even if there is a small festival. To attract more women, the factory is building a hostel within the premises.“Hostels are being built in the industrial premises to accommodate women workers,” he said. “Women who are unable to commute daily to work already have an option of renting a room inside the factory premises. Some of them are even living with their families.”According to a 2018 World Bank report, there were 3.8 million wage jobs in Nepal, while another 2.8 million Nepalis were employed in other countries. Nepal Jobs Diagnostic indicates that most wage jobs are going to men. Altogether, men took up over two-thirds of the new wage jobs added to the economy since 2008.“Although most women in Nepal work, the majority are unpaid. Nepal remains a highly rural economy where subsistence farming is the main economic activity for women,” said the report. The Lumbini Industrial Corridor, which houses 26 factories, including cement, synthetics, spinning, steel, paper, plywood and food grains, employs about 5,000 daily workers directly and indirectly.In addition, there are around five dozen factories in the Bhairahawa-Parasi and Bhairahawa-Butwal industrial corridor which requires thousands of skilled workers. If, like Jagdamba Spinning Mills and Jagdamba Synthetics, more factories hire Nepali women, the benefit will go beyond just providing employment, according to factory managers.The wages earned by women workers go directly to the family and there are little chances of the money being misused, Rayamajhi said. Men’s income, on the other hand, does not all go to their families. “Male workers spend their salaries unnecessarily,” said Bidur Dhungana, general secretary of the Western Cement Producers' Association in Rupandehi. According to the World Bank report, women using their productive capacity to feed their families, while important, generates no income for them, under-utilising their human capital and leaving them economically isolated. “As a result, Nepal’s economy is losing out on much of the production potential of women,” said the 2018 report.","Published at : February 14, 2021",Bhairahawa,Madhav Dhungana
Political leaders on ribbon-cutting spree in Lumbini in a bid to woo voters,"On Saturday, Chief Minister of Lumbini Province Shankar Pokharel laid the foundation stone for an under-construction motorable bridge over Dhangsi stream in Libang, Rolpa. Only 25 percent of the bridge’s construction work has been completed so far. On January 27, Finance Minister Bishnu Paudel inaugurated the road expansion work along the Siddhartha Highway from Chauraha to Chidiya Khola in Butwal. The expansion work of the six-lane road was started in the fiscal year 2016-17 and was expected to be completed within two years. But the project has missed several deadlines and is unlikely to meet the next deadline of April 2022, since only 10 percent of the work is complete so far. But Paudel nevertheless went ahead and inaugurated the project. He also inaugurated two bridges that were completed a year ago while in Butwal. According to the local residents, ever since Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli called midterm polls in two phases on April 30 and May 10, following the split of the Nepal Communist Party into two factions, leaders of the ruling party have been busy inaugurating and laying foundation stones for infrastructure projects in Lumbini Province in a bid to woo voters. “The leaders have already started campaigning for the elections. They are in a rush to show that development is happening in their constituencies. They are now trying to expedite work that has been pending since the last elections,” said Birman Budha, 62, of Tulsipur Sub Metropolitan City Ward No. 5. “They have come back again with fake agendas and activities. We will not be fooled this time,” he said. On January 18, Baijanath Chaudhary, minister of Physical Infrastructure Development, also the spokesperson of Lumbini provincial government, laid the foundation stone for the expansion of a 6.8 km road that connects Tinau river to Patthardanda Chowk in Tilottama Municipality, Rupandehi.At the beginning of 2021, Chief Minister Pokharel had also laid the foundation stone for the Sulichaur-Thabang road project in Rolpa and inaugurated Sonatara Lift Drinking Water Project in Swargadwari, Pyuthan, and several other development projects in Kapilvastu, Dang, Banke and Bardiya districts. On January 25, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli had also arrived in Dang to inaugurate a motorable bridge the construction of which was completed a year ago. The programme was attended by Chief Minister Pokharel and Minister of Drinking Water Mani Thapa. Even members of the National Assembly are busy laying foundation stones for various development projects in the province. On January 27, Komal Oli, a member of National Assembly, laid foundation stones for a suspension bridge at Tulsipur Sub Metropolis. Civil society leaders in Dang have criticised the inauguration and foundation stone laying spree of the Prime Minister, Chief Minister, ministers and other assembly members. “Important issues such as education and health have taken a backseat,” said Chandra Raj Pant, a civil society leader in Dang. “The threat of Covid-19 is still high but that has not dampened leaders’ enthusiasm for inaugurations and ribbon-cutting ceremonies. They are again engaging in cheap publicity campaigns.” Seema Chaudhary, 34, a local resident of Ghorahi Sub Metropolis, says the political parties are going against public sentiment, unable to feel the pulse of the people. “The leaders should know what people want by now. Rather than spending their time in petty political squabbles, they should work on improving the health sector for the public,” Chaudhary said. Dhanbir Nepali, 48, a native of Babai Rural Municipality, echoed Chaudhary’s sentiments. “We want development in the education and health sectors. Leaders should work as per the aspiration of the people. But that has never happened,” he said. Currently, the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure Development in Lumbini Province coordinates the inauguration and foundation stone-laying ceremonies of development projects. Sushil Chandra Tiwari, secretary at the ministry, says the timing of these ceremonies has inadvertently made these occasions look like election campaigns. “It wasn’t planned that way. Some of the inauguration and foundation stone laying programmes were scheduled for earlier dates but the ministers weren’t free and the Covid-19 pandemic was at its peak,” said Tiwari.","Published at : February 8, 2021",Dang,Durga Lal KC
Kapilvastu Municipality distributes bicycles to girl students,"Eighteen-year-old Bidhyawati Yadav of Kapilvastu Municipality Ward No. 2 in Kapilvastu district says she is looking forward to attending school on her bicycle that was gifted by the ward office. She is an eleventh grader at Tauleshwornath Sanskrit School in Taulihawa, the district headquarters of Kapilvastu district.On Friday, Kapilvastu Ward No. 2 distributed bicycles to girl students of impoverished, Dalit and Muslim families pursuing their higher education at various community schools. According to the ward office, the bicycles were distributed to the girl students to encourage them to attend school regularly. “My school is far from my house. By the time I got done with household chores and left for school, I would always be running late. But now I can reach school quickly on the bicycle. This has made my life easier,” Yadav said. Twenty-five girls studying in various community schools of Ward No. 2 received bicycles on Friday. They have assured the ward officials to be regular in their schools.Most of the girl students from the southern part of Kapilvastu face difficulties in continuing with their higher education because of household responsibilities and long distance to their schools. “I had to walk all the way to my school after completing my household chores. But now, I can reach school on time on my bicycle and don’t have to waste so much time on the road,” said Deepa Kurmi, 18, from Ramatalahaki in Kapilvastu Municipality. She studies at grade 11 of Buddhapadam Higher Secondary School.According to Ram Bhajan Kalawar, chairman of Kapilvastu Ward No. 2, the ward office decided to distribute bicycles to young girls to empower them. “Ill practices like child marriage are prevalent in our society due to a lack of education. With the cycle distribution drive, girls have become motivated to attend schools regularly. This is our achievement,” Kalawar said. The ward office said it will continue the campaign in the next fiscal year as well.","Published at : January 25, 2021",Kapilvastu,Manoj Paudel
Wildlife rescue in Palpa unsafe due to ill-equipped forest offices,"An adult leopard fell into a snare that some villagers had set up to trap porcupines at Bhuwanpokhari in Rainadevi Chhahara Rural Municipality, Palpa in November last year.After spotting the leopard entangled in barbed wires, the villagers immediately informed the Division Forest Office. The forest officials reached the site but they did not have a tranquiliser gun to dart the leopard and rescue it. The ill-equipped team of forest officials and security personnel rescued the leopard four hours later with the help of an excavator. By then, the leopard had sustained serious injuries and had to be taken to Chitwan for treatment the next day. He died a couple of days later. “The leopard could have survived if we had been able to tranquilise it and remove him from the trap on time. But the rescue operation took too long. The forest office does not have the necessary tools and technologies required for wildlife rescue,” said Mohan Paudel, chief at the Division Forest Office in Palpa. “As a result, most of the animals die while being rescued or shortly after their rescue.” Bhuwanpokhari’s incident of leopard rescue is just a case in point. The rescue of wildlife is a difficult task for the forest officials and security personnel due to a lack of tranquiliser guns and various other equipment required for a safe and immediate rescue work.According to the data available at the forest office, around 50 leopards were rescued in Palpa district in the past year. “More than 40 of them died while being rescued or due to delay in rescue,” said Yamlal Pokharel, the information officer at the Division Forest Office. According to him, the rescue work of other animals, including snakes, bears, wild boars, porcupines and barking deer, among others, are equally difficult.Pokharel also underscored the need for a wildlife rescue and treatment centre for the effective rehabilitation of wildlife. “We have difficulties in rescuing wild animals, as we do not have the necessary infrastructures and facilities where we can rehabilitate the rescued animals,” said Pokharel.The local residents of Bhuwanpokhari say wild animals have begun entering human settlements in search of food and water of late. The forest consumers’ groups and the villagers use sticks and other tools to chase the wild animals away. “We chase away the straying wild animals by ourselves and inform the forest office if an animal is found injured or trapped. But the forest officials cannot always rescue the trapped wildlife to safety, as they do not have tranquiliser guns and other tools required,” said Jhabindra Neupane, a consumer of a local community forest in Ribdikot Rural Municipality-1.Paudel admits that wildlife rescue in Palpa is ineffective and unsuccessful due to a lack of modern technologies and equipment in the district forest offices. “We have to rescue wild animals by using traditional tools and technologies. So many wild animals die because of that,” said Paudel, adding that the forest office has informed the higher authorities about the need for tranquiliser guns and other tools. “But they are yet to address our issue.”The conservation of various wild animals has been challenging across the country, mainly due to poaching and smuggling. The unsafe rescue of wildlife further worsens the wildlife conservation efforts, conservationists say.“Various wild animals, including leopards and bears, are tortured and even killed during rescue operations. The necessary tools and equipment are required for their safe rescue,” said Dil Bahadur Khangaha, another consumer of a local community forest in the district. He urged the concerned authorities to manage the tools and set up a rescue and treatment facility for the rescued wildlife’s rehabilitation in the district.","Published at : January 21, 2021",Palpa,Madhav Aryal
Pyuthan District Hospital fails to provide effective health services,"Buddhiram Sarki, 73, of Baddanda in Ward No. 4 of Pyuthan Municipality took his 71-year-old wife Sukundra to the District Hospital in Bijuwar a few days ago. His wife is suffering from movement disorders.The hospital referred Sukundra to the local medical clinic citing that the hospital could not treat her there. A doctor of the clinic then referred her to the Butwal-based Lumbini City Hospital and Medical Science Pvt Ltd. She was taken to the city hospital in an ambulance covering a distance of 133 kilometres by road.Buddhiram says after three days at the city hospital, he could no longer afford to keep his wife admitted. “I spent Rs 120,000 at the hospital in three days. I could not bear the treatment cost so I moved my wife to Gurans Hospital in Butwal where the cost of treatment is less,” he said. Sukandra is currently admitted at Gurans Hospital and Buddhiram has returned to Pyuthan to manage money for his wife’s treatment. “Now I have to sell our house and property for my wife’s treatment,” he said. “Just keeping her at the hospital is not enough. We have to bear more expenses of food and accommodation since we are seeking treatment outside the district.”Most Pyuthan residents are compelled to seek treatment outside the district since the health infrastructure there is poor, says Buddhiram. “The district hospital does not have doctors and other medical professionals. Because of this, patients have to be taken to hospitals outside the district,” he said.Laxmi Prakash Raj Bhandari, spokesperson and also the chairman of Ward No. 4 in Pyuthan Municipality, said, “Doctors at the District Hospital do not stay on duty regularly. Patients are facing difficulties in receiving treatment. We tried our best to reform the hospital, but failed to do so.”According to Bhandari, the municipality had also helped the hospital administration to construct physical infrastructures. “We have also informed the chief district officer of Pyuthan about the condition of the hospital. On Monday, when a team of municipal officials reached the hospital, there were only two health workers—a health assistant and an auxiliary health worker,” Bhandari said. The District Hospital in Pyuthan is a 50-bed health institution with two positions of medical specialists and five medical officers. The positions of medical specialists have been vacant for a long time now. There should have been five medical officers at the hospital but only one is on duty at present. Two of the medical officers are in training, one on leave and the post of another one is vacant. But even that one doctor on duty is found to be absent on most days. Chief District Officer Khimraj Bhusal says he has received numerous complaints about mismanagement in the hospital. “There are issues with filling the vacant posts at the hospital. Dr Sabhu Kafle, acting medical superintendent, is currently in training in Butwal. She will soon join the hospital,” Bhusal said. Video X-ray and lab services, among others, are also irregular at the hospital. “We will soon inspect the hospital and take stock of the situation and try to reform it through the hospital development committee,” said Bhushal.“The hospital used to receive 400 patients on a daily basis but these days, hardly 100 patients visit the hospital,” said Bhandari, the ward chairman of Ward No. 4 Pyuthan Municipality.","Published at : January 16, 2021",Pyuthan,Giru Prasad Bhandari
"One dead, three injured at the hands of faith healers in Gulmi","An elderly man died after a faith healer couple burned parts of his body and thrashed him in the name of treatment at Resunga Municipality-1 in Gulmi district on Wednesday.Three others were also injured due to the beating of the couple. DSP Purushottam Pandeya at the District Police Office said Ram Bahadur Mukhiya, 64, of Darlamchaur in Isma Rural Municipality-3 died in the incident that he described as “inhuman and shocking”. “The faith healer couple had been employing similar superstitious rituals in the name of treatment to other people for years,” said Pandeya. “Mukhia died as the couple branded him with heated iron and steel rods.” Mukhia’s two sons Hum Bahadur and Krishna and one Topala Damai of Resunga-5 were also injured due to the beating of the faith healers. “Damai who was seriously injured in the incident was referred to United Mission Hospital in Palpa while Hum Bahadur is being treated at Gulmi District Hospital,” said Pandey. Krishna sustained minor injuries and did not require a hospital stay.Pandeya said Mukhia succumbed to injuries inflicted on him by Ram Prasad Shrestha, 38, and his wife Shantila Shrestha, 36. The Shrestha couple, originally from Malika Rural Municipality-6 in Gulmi, was living at Tindhara in Resunga-1 on rent. According to Udaya Bahadur Thapa, the ward chief of Resunga-2, the Shrestha couple had taken a local man’s land on lease and built a hut there.Police handed over Mukhia’s body to the family after carrying out his postmortem at Gulmi District Hospital on Wednesday. He was cremated the same day.The Shrestha couple were taken into custody after the incident. “Investigation is going on into the incident. A case will be filed against them on murder charge. They will also be tried for spreading superstitious beliefs,” said Pandeya.The deceased was suffering from severe back pain and had been visiting the Shrestha couple regularly since Saturday. “They [Shrestha couple] forbade our father from eating on Tuesday evening. They repeatedly burnt different parts of his body with a heated iron rod and severely beat him till midnight,” Hum Bahadur said. “They stopped beating our father only after he fell unconscious. They told us that our father would be fine the next morning. But he was dead the next morning.” Hum Bahadur said his family had paid the Shrestha couple around Rs 30,000 to treat his father. Damai, the other victim, said she visited the couple because her thyroid issue was not getting better.  “I started taking medicines for thyroid condition from June last year but I wasn’t getting better. I stopped taking medicines after a few months and visited the Shrestha couple seeking a cure at the recommendation of my neighbours,” said Damai. She had already paid Rs 11,000 to the couple. “They beat me and burnt me with heated iron rods and pipes in the name of treatment,” she said.The Shrestha couple did not let others, except those seeking their service, into the hut. According to the local residents, they did not know what the Shrestha couple was up to.On Wednesday, Ram Prasad lodged a complaint with the police stating that some unfamiliar people had entered his house and were disturbing him.""We sent a police team to the hut. We found Mukhia dead and three others injured when we reached there,” said Pandeya.","Published at : January 14, 2021",Palpa,Madhav Aryal
Cold weather affects life in several Tarai districts,"Tulasa Chaudhary, 56, of Butwal Sub-metropolitan City Ward No. 17 in Rupandehi has been housebound for the past four days due to a plunge in temperatures. A vegetable seller, she moves around the city selling the produce from her field. “The past few days have been very difficult for me. The cold wave has made it difficult for me to go about my daily work. It’s hard to preserve my vegetables too,” she said. Hawkers generally go from street to street in the morning to sell vegetables but the streets have been empty of hawkers in Butwal of late due to the cold wave.Rupandehi, a Tarai district in Lumbini Province, has not received sunshine for the past four days, according to local residents. Human movement in the marketplaces and even the traffic flow in the streets have significantly decreased. The cold wave has affected everyone but it’s the daily wage earners like Chaudhary who have been hit the hardest.Sharada Tharu of Butwal says she is worried about managing her daily expenses since it’s getting difficult for her to go out in the morning to sell vegetables. “I sell vegetables door-to-door but the past few days have seen a thick blanket of fog in the morning,” said Tharu. “It’s difficult to go out in the morning but I am braving the cold for now. If the cold wave continues, I may not be able to step out.” Cold wave is a weather condition with a rapid fall in temperature due to a lack of sunshine, dense fog and cold wind. Districts across the Tarai region are affected by the cold wave every year. Patients with special medical needs are also hit hard by the increasingly cold weather in the area. “I have to provide special care to my elderly father-in-law, an asthma patient. The cold is cruel to patients like him,” said Dharmikala Chaudhary of Kohalpur-2 in Banke district. She too has not been able to venture out of her house for the past few days due to the cold wave.In Nepalgunj, business activities have come to a standstill, which has pushed many wage earners into difficult times. “I haven’t been able to find any work in the past two days,” said Jogendra Khatri, who ekes out a living as a porter in BP Chowk, Nepalgunj. “So many of us have been jobless with no alternate source of income.” Various district administrations and local units have started distributing warm clothes and firewoods to the impoverished people. The district administration office in Baridaya has distributed 50 blankets to elderly people and postpartum mothers. Chief District Officer Liladhar Adhikari said the district administration released Rs 1 million budget as disaster management to eight local units in the district in light of this year’s cold wave.In Kapilvastu, marketplaces and government offices on Tuesday wore a deserted look due to the biting cold. According to Ramu Regmi, an officer at Ramnagar field unit of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, Tuesday was the coldest day in Kapilvastu this year. “The minimum temperature was recorded at eight degree Celsius on Tuesday. The sky might not open up for the next few days,” said Regmi.Medical professionals advise people to stay indoors to avoid catching cold-related diseases like pneumonia and viral fever. “In cold weather, the chances of infants below five years catching pneumonia are very high. Special care should be provided to senior citizens and people with chronic diseases,” said Dr Dinesh Shrestha, the deputy director at Nepalgunj Medical College.Dharan in Province 1 witnessed dense fog for the first time in 12 years and visibility was reduced to 50 metres on Tuesday morning, according to Akhalesh Chaurasiya, an assistant meteorologist in the Dharan-based Meteorological Forecasting Division.Geographically, Dharan, which is encircled by hills from three sides and connected to Chhar Koshe forest in Tarai, is listed as a low fog area. “Cold waves are common in Tarai during this season. The dense fog in Dharan is mainly due to the western low-pressure system,” said Chaurasiya.According to him, the minimum temperature was recorded at 14.4 degree Celsius in Dharan on Tuesday.Meanwhile, normal life in Province 2 has also been affected due to the cold wave since the last two days. But authorities have done nothing for impoverished households who are facing extreme cold weather conditions.(With inputs from our local correspondents)","Published at : January 13, 2021",Lumbini,Lumbini Province Bureau
"Women hit by pandemic, domestic violence at high risk of trafficking","A woman from Sindhupalchok district was rescued by the officials of Maiti Nepal, an social organisation working in the field of anti-human trafficking, in Nepalgunj, Banke on January 1.The woman in her early forties was on her way to the Gulf country, as assured by her agent, through India. She learned that she was being sent abroad illegally only after she was rescued from Jamunaha border point.“My husband has been rendered jobless by the Covid-19 pandemic. Now he has taken to alcohol. He idles away at the village drunk and comes home and beats me,” she said. “I have to live in poverty and violence. That’s why I decided to go for foreign employment.” According to her, she came to Nepalgunj with an acquaintance expecting to go to India and fly to the Gulf country thereon.But she did not have the necessary documents required to travel to a foreign country for employment. So was stopped at the border unit on suspicions of being a victim to human trafficking.According to Maiti Nepal, she was rescued along with five other women while they were being smuggled into India.Keshav Koirala, Nepalgunj coordinator of the organisation, said that human traffickers have been luring women hit hardest by the pandemic and gender-related violence.A 35-year-old woman from Makwanpur district was also rescued on the same day. She was also running away from poverty after she separated with her husband. “My husband and I have separated. I could see no way I could make a living in the village so I decided to go abroad,” said the woman. According to the Nepalgunj branch of Maiti Nepal, as many as 14 women who were heading to the Gulf country through India have been rescued from Jamunaha border point in the past two weeks. Eight women were rescued in January while six were rescued in the last week of December. Most of the rescued women are from Sindhupalchok, Kavre, Makwanpur, Dhading, Bhojpur, Kapilvastu, Tanahun, Lamjung, Chitwan among other districts.“The women who attempted to cross the border did not have any documents required for foreign employment. The women did not know where they were going,” said Koirala. According to him, the rescued women, aged between 22 to 45 years, will be sent back to their families.“The women and girls who are hugely affected due to the pandemic are at high risk of trafficking. Women who find themselves in a financial crisis are found taking risks to go abroad even illegally. But they don’t know the risks involved. Going to India to fly to a Gulf country without necessary documents is risky and they can become victims to human trafficking,” said Koirala.Human traffickers have been using the Jamunha border to take the foreign job aspirants to India illegally. According to the data available at the Nepalgunj branch of the Maiti Nepal, a total of 267 India-bound women and girls were rescued in 2020 in suspicion of possible human trafficking. “It is difficult to conduct a successful rescue operation once the victims have crossed the border. So we try our best to stop such incidents at the border” said Koirala.","Published at : January 9, 2021",Banke,Madhu Shahi
Smuggling of wildlife parts rampant in Butwal,"On December 6, Rupandehi police confiscated a rhino horn from New Kalash Hotel in Sukhanagar, Ward No. 8 of Butwal Sub Metropolis.While confiscating the horn, Birendra Bahadur Singh, one of the smugglers, snatched a pistol from a policeman, opened fire and escaped the scene. Rakesh Neupane from Kathmandu, who was involved in the smuggling racket, sustained bullet injuries in the incident. Two arrests were made that day. Singh of Nayakbada Rural Municipality in Jajarkot is still at large, police said. The next day, on December 7, police confiscated a musk deer’s gland from Ward No. 10 in Devdaha Municipality. Satya Narayan Thapa, deputy superintendent of police in Rupandehi, said eight incidents related to wildlife smuggling were reported in the first five months of the current fiscal year. “Eighteen individuals were arrested for their involvement in wildlife smuggling. Among them, nine have been remanded in judicial custody,” said Thapa. As per the existing legal provisions, a jail term of five to 15 years and a fine of up to Rs500,000 can be given to a person convicted of poaching a rhino or musk deer and smuggling their body parts.Of late, Butwal in Rupandehi has become a hub for wildlife smuggling. According to police investigation, smugglers have been bringing wildlife parts from various parts of the country and using Butwal as a transit point to smuggle them to China from the Korala border point.“Butwal is one of the big cities in the country and people's movement is high here. Smugglers take advantage of this to smuggle wildlife body parts,” said Prabin Pokharel, superintendent of police in the District Police Office in Rupandehi. On September 11, five people were arrested with two sets of pangolin skulls from Nepalgunj Road in Ward No. 5 of Butwal Sub Metropolis. According to the Division Forest Office, the five arrested had killed the pangolins themselves with the intention to sell the body parts in Butwal. “The carriers were mostly found with leopard and pangolin body parts. But we haven’t been able to arrest the individuals responsible for the export of wildlife parts to China” said Bodhraj Subedi, chief at the Division Forest Office in Rupandehi.In the past, smugglers used to transport wildlife parts to Tibet in China from Darchula, Dolpa or from Rukum (East). But of late, smugglers have been using an alternative route—Rupandehi-Gulmi-Dhorpatan-Korala border point—for the export. “Butwal has become a safe bet for wildlife smugglers because it's a big commercial hub,” said Deepak Gyawali, spokesperson at the Ministry of Industry, Tourism, Forest and Environment in Lumbini Province. “So far, police have been able to arrest only carriers. The police must go after the criminal masterminds of wildlife smuggling to eradicate this illegal activity.”","Published at : December 16, 2020",Butwal,Amrita Anmol
Construction of waste processing centre in Rupandehi starts,"The government has started the construction of a waste processing centre in Sainamaina Municipality of Rupandehi district.The investment in the project is said to be around Rs 1 billion. According to authorities, the waste processing centre will be able to process 400 tonnes of garbage on a daily basis.Waste management is a major problem in Rupandehi district. Due to the absence of proper waste management plants in the district, the majority of the local units have been dumping waste on river banks and open areas. To solve the garbage management problem in Rupandehi, the federal government has enlisted waste management projects in the district as one of the national priority projects.To address the garbage issue in the district, authorities had earlier initiated the construction of a waste disposal centre in Butwal but the project could not move forward due to locals’ disagreement with the proposed location. The proposed waste management centre in Butwal was said to be constructed with financial support from a donor. But locals and leaders of various political parties protested against the proposal and the plan was cancelled.“The construction of a waste management centre in Butwal came to a halt due to obstruction by the locals. Therefore, a waste management centre is now being constructed in Ward No. 10 of Sainamaina with the government’s investment, ” said Shivaraj Subedi, mayor of Butwal Sub Metropolis.In the first phase of the project, garbage from Sainamaina, Butwal and Kanchan Rural Municipality will be processed at the waste management centre. “In the second phase, we plan to process waste from all 16 local units of Rupandehi and also from four local units of Kapilvastu district,” said Chitra Bahadur Karki, mayor of Sainamaina Municipality. “All solid waste, including medical ones, can be processed at the waste processing centre. We plan to utilise the by-products as compost fertiliser.” According to him, they are also looking into monetising the plan in the future. “We have selected an area far from human settlements to minimise conflicts with the local residents,” he said. “The centre will be handed over to the private sector for operation after completion of the construction work.”The proposed waste processing centre is spread in three bighas of land in Ukash Chhetra of Khormor Khola. It is five kilometres away from the East-West Highway and two kilometres from a human settlement.According to Mayor Karki, the project was started after conducting an Environmental Impact Assessment in the proposed area. “The report showed that we could go ahead with the construction of the waste processing centre at Sainamaina,” he said.The federal government has provided Rs 100 million as grant for the construction of the waste processing centre. In the last fiscal year, the government had allocated Rs 30 million for the project. Suraj Neupane, the project chief of Sainamaina Municipality, said, “The Ministry of Urban Development has also allocated Rs 4.5 million for garbage management in the district. The amount will be utilised to repair and upgrade the side roads that link the highway to the waste processing centre.”The Ministry of Finance has also vowed to provide an additional budget for the construction of the waste processing centre after the project was included in the national priority projects list. “A Detailed Project Report has been prepared for the construction of the project. We will send additional budget on the basis of the work performance,” said Finance Minister Bishnu Prasad Paudel, adding that he has directed the project officials to complete the construction of the waste processing centre within two years.","Published at : December 9, 2020",Butwal,Amrita Anmol
Only isolation centre in Rolpa closed despite several active Covid-19 cases,"The only isolation facility in Rolpa has been closed down by authorities despite the district having many active cases, according to the health and population ministry. There are 22 active Covid-19 cases in Rolpa as of Monday. With the closure of the isolation centre at Jaljala Multiple Campus in Liwang, the district headquarters of Rolpa, Covid-19 patients in the district have been deprived of proper health care and facilities. The isolation facility was closed three weeks ago after the campus administration asked the District Covid-19 Crisis Management Committee to vacate its premises.“We asked the chief district officer and other concerned authorities to make arrangements for a new location for the isolation centre and not to shut it down completely but they paid no heed to us,” said Phabindra Aacharya, the coordinator of Rolpa Hospital Management Committee. “The treatment of the infected has been greatly affected by the closure of the isolation centre. We held talks with the chief district officer several times regarding the management of the isolation facility but to no avail,” said Aacharya. According to him, the health authority is facing further challenges in their fight against coronavirus since the District Covid-19 Crisis Management Committee, which is headed by the chief district officer, is ineffective in its actions.“The District Coordination Committee, Rolpa Municipality Office and other local units are also indifferent towards the issue,” said Aacharya. “We have been asking them to make arrangements for an isolation centre but no one has listened to us.” The isolation centre at Jaljala Multiple Campus, which had been set up at the cost of Rs3 million, had started providing services in June. The centre was run with the financial support of Rolpa Municipality and nine rural municipalities in the district. Around 200 coronavirus-infected people received health services from the centre since its establishment.Chief District Officer Narendra Rana said the District Covid-19 Crisis Management Committee has not taken any decision over the operation of the isolation centre in the district due to the government’s policy of giving priority to home isolation. “We have urged the infected people to stay in home isolation by following health security protocols,” said Rana, adding that the committee would provide necessary support to the infected if they faced any health difficulties. According to Rolpa Hospital, 15 Covid-19 patients are receiving treatment outside the district. The infected people have been urged to stay in home isolation but no institution has been given the responsibility to monitor them.Health officials have underscored the need for a separate treatment centre for Covid-19 patients to prevent the community transmission of the virus. They say the risk of community transmission is high from patients staying in home isolation since they cannot strictly follow health security measures in congested living quarters.“We are planning to provide treatment to the infected people by isolating them. But we cannot do it due to a lack of space,” said Dr Dhanamaya Gharti Magar. According to her, the hospital refers symptomatic Covid-19 patients to Banke, Dang, Butwal and Kathmandu for treatment due to the lack of isolation ward in the district.A total of 253 people have been infected with the virus in the district so far. Three patients died in the course of treatment.","Published at : November 25, 2020",Rolpa,Kashiram Dangi
Jagadishpur lake welcomes thousands of migratory birds,"Thousands of migratory birds have arrived at Jagadishpur lake, a Ramsar wetland site in Kapilvastu, with the arrival of the winter season this year.Various species of birds from as far as Siberia migrate to the lake during winter in search of food. The migratory birds started flocking to the Jagadishpur lake in October second week this year. The lake, which is considered as a haven for birding, is hosting thousands of birds at present. “Around 6,000 to 8,000 birds have arrived at the Jagadishpur lake so far,” said ornithologist Hem Sagar Baral. “The arrival of migratory birds will continue for the next few weeks.” According to conservationists, several bird species including, Common coot, Gadwall, Lesser Whistling duck, Tufted duck, Ferruginous duck, Northern pintail, Northern shoveler, Eurasian Wigeon, Common Pochard and Cotton Pygmy-goose, migrate to the Jagadishpur lake every winter.Shiva Bahadur Wagle, the chief of Kapilvastu Municipality Ward No. 9, said around 300 migratory birds have been making their way to the Jagadishpur lake from the north every day. “Common coot, locally known as Marul, is the major bird species that have arrived in the lake. Approximately 3,000 Common coots have already reached the lake this year,” said Wagle. Many tourists have been frequenting the lake area since the first week of November for bird watching, says Rambilas Kewat, an employee at the lake conservation committee. “The flow of visitors has increased after the Dashain festival. More than 200 people visit the lake on a daily basis now,” he said. Madhab Belbase of Bhumahi from neighbouring Rupandehi district had visited the lake area with his friends a couple of days ago. “I came here to watch birds after I heard their arrival to the lake had already begun. This is a sight to behold,” Belbase said. Shyam KC, a resident of Bhaluwang in Dang district, has also had a similar experience. “It is an immense pleasure to watch thousands of birds at the same time. I walked around three kilometres around the lake watching the birds and listening to their chirpings,” said KC.Ruddy Shelducks, a bird species known as Chakhewa in Nepal, are the major attraction in the Jagadishpur lake. Hari hans, a rare bird species, are also spotted in the lake in a good number. “The birds will stay in the lake till February,” said ornithologist Baral.According to conservationists, of the 886 species of birds officially recorded in Nepal, around 118, including grebes, cormorants, herons, egrets, stork, ducks and geese, terns and gulls, are found in the Jagadishpur area.According to Som GC, another ornithologist, birds from as far as Siberia, China, Mongolia, Turkmenistan, and Kyrgyzstan, among other countries, migrate to the Jagadishpur lake every year to avoid severe cold. “The birds also face a shortage of food when it starts snowing in the northern areas. So they migrate to warmer places like the Jagadishpur lake area. Some birds travel around 4,000 to 5,000 miles to arrive at the lake,” said BC.The lake is spread over an area of 157 hectares and is located in Kapilvastu Municipality-9, 11km north of Taulihawa, the district headquarters. As Nepal’s biggest man-made lake, the Jagadishpur lake has been included in the list of Wetlands of International Importance. It was listed as the international wetland area in August 2003.","Published at : November 24, 2020",Kapilvastu,Manoj Paudel
Uncontrolled people’s movement risking Rupandehi to Covid-19 outbreak,"Over a 100 Covid-19 cases are being reported in Rupandehi district on a daily basis. But the district is not doing much to contain the spread of the virus.Kedar Shah, vector control chief of the Health Office in Rupandehi, said, “People in Butwal, Bhairahawa, Tilottama, Murgiya and Devadaha are not following social distancing measures. They are roaming around the bazaar areas without adhering to safety protocols, increasing the rate of infection in Rupandehi.”According to him, 80 out of 100 individuals in Bhairahawa and Butwal could have contracted the virus by now. “The situation is going out of control. But there’s no proper control and prevention measures to contain the disease,” said Shah. So far, 22,073 individuals have tested positive for Covid-19 in Lumbini Province with 2,807 active cases as of Friday.In Rupandehi alone, there are 8,478 Covid-19 cases. As the district lacks the mechanism to control the spread of the virus, Covid-19 cases have been increasing day by day. Dr Pushpa Raj Paudel, corona focal person at the Ministry of Social Development in Lumbini Province, said, “The majority of people in Rupandehi are found roaming the bazaar areas without face masks. They are not following proper health protocols in places of business and public vehicles. That is why Covid-19 cases have escalated in Rupandehi.” Rupandehi is the trade point of the western region of the country. The Lumbini provincial government has also prioritised Butwal while developing infrastructures to combat coronavirus. The government has established Covid-19 Special Hospital in Dhago Karkhana in Butwal. Until now, over 400 Covid-19 patients have received treatment from the hospital. Dr Bishnu Gautam, information officer at the Covid-19 Hospital, said, “Covid-19 patients from other provinces like Lumini, Gandaki and even Karnali come to our hospital for treatment. Among the 400 patients that received treatment here, around 80 percent have already recovered.” Gautam further added that most patients these days come to the hospital only when their health condition deteriorates.“Most of the patients are staying in home isolation,” he said.Rupandehi is also the trade point of Baglung, Parbat and Syangja districts. Every day, more than 5,000 vehicles to and from Butwal run on the East-West Highway. “Rupandehi has become the hotspot of coronavirus in the province, as Butwal is the centre of business, transportation, health and education, among other sectors,” Minister for Social Development of Lumbini Sudarshan Baral said. “Due to uncontrolled people’s movement and negligence in following safe health measures, the rate of Covid-19 infection has increased here. The virus can only be controlled if the citizens are aware and careful.” Lockdown in Resunga, GulmiResunga Municipality in Gulmi has reimposed lockdown for eight days starting from Friday due to the spread of Covid-19 in schools, financial institutions and colleges. Bom Aryal, health in-charge at the municipality, said, “We have decided to reimpose lockdown to control the spread of the virus.” Until Friday, the district had 179 active cases.","Published at : November 24, 2020",Rupandehi,Ghanashyam Gautam
"Murder investigation an excuse for police to harass locals, Dudawa residents say","On October 27, the body of 12-year-old Sunil Raidas was found in a pond close to his house in Dudawa Rural Municipality-3, Banke. Since then, the police have detained several locals and taken many into custody for questioning. One such suspect, Babulal Raidas, 36, of Bankatti in the rural municipality was found hanging inside the toilet of the District Police Office on Friday.The locals of Dudawa claim that police personnel frequent the villages every day and detain them but have so far failed to build a case against anyone. The police have so far detained 18 villagers, including children, in connection with the incident. Babulal, who was in custody for 25 days, was one of them. Babulal’s family claim that he was tortured while in police custody and blame the police’s botched investigation for his death.“Security personnel come to the settlement almost every day and detain whoever they meet in the village. They have arrested my son and kept him in custody. The police have terrorised us,” said Lalita Soni, mother of 21-year-old Ajaya who is also in custody for investigation. While the locals express their displeasure at the police administration’s approach to the investigation, Sunil’s relatives are still seeking justice for their murdered son. “It’s been almost a month since our son was tortured and killed. The police are yet to find the culprits,” said Bisharam, Sunil’s father. “We have been trying to register a complaint naming the suspect/s but the police haven’t done so. They say it will affect their investigation.” Sunil had gone missing on October 26 and his body was recovered the next day. The Area Police Office in Bankatti is just 500 metres from the incident site. Deputy Superintendent of Police Subhas Khadka claims that a detailed investigation into the case is underway. “We began investigating immediately after the incident came to light. We will soon bring the culprit/s to book,” he said.","Published at : November 23, 2020",Nepalgunj,Thakur Singh Tharu
Delay in hospital visits putting mothers and newborns at risk in Rupandehi,"On September 29, 20-year-old Kaushilya Yadav gave birth to her daughter at Bagaha Health Post.Yadav, a resident of Rohini Rural Municipality Ward No. 1 in Rupandehi, was taken to the health post after prolonged labour pain since her family had decided to opt for a home birth. “She delivered her child at the health post but both the mother and the child’s health deteriorated after the birth. The newborn needed supplemental oxygen so we referred them to Universal College of Medical Sciences in Bhairahawa,” said Shanta Gyawali, an auxiliary nurse midwife at the health post. The baby did not survive, according to family members. “We were making arrangements for Rs 10,000 needed for the baby’s admission to the ICU. By the time we got around to it, my baby had died,” said Yadav. Thirty-year-old Shila Yadav, a resident of Rohini Rural Municipality, gave birth to her son at home on September 2 even though the nearest health post was just five metres away from her house. “She was brought to the health post with post-birth complications,” said Gyawali. “If there was any further delay in bringing the mother and child to the hospital, we would have lost them both.” According to Gyawali, delay in bringing expecting mothers to health posts puts both the child and the mother at grave risks. The local health post has been raising awareness among locals about the importance of prenatal and postnatal care and the safety of institutional births, but it hasn’t stopped locals from opting for home births. “We also provide counselling to family members of expecting mothers. We ask them to visit the health post as often as possible but not many listen,” said Gyawali.Most pregnant women in the northern and southern parts of Rupandehi only visit health posts and hospitals when they face complications during home birth, say health officials. Rajyalaxmi Shrestha, an auxiliary nurse midwife at Dhakdhahi Primary Health Centre in Rupandehi, says, “By the time pregnant women are brought in, it’s too late for us to be able to help them. So we have to refer them to fully facilitated hospitals. If they come to us before their health gets worse, we can help them with safe delivery.” According to Dr Bishnu Gautam, an obstetrician at Lumbini Hospital, the locals’ preference for home births and postponing hospital visits put both mothers and their babies at risk.“We need to sensitise the local population and raise more awareness about safe institutional delivery,” Gautam said. “The pandemic has also affected the rate of institutional births in the district. Health posts in the northern and southern parts of Rupandehi used to receive 30 to 40 cases in a month,” said Gautam. Now, these health posts are receiving just five to 10 delivery cases, according to the data of the District Health Office in Rupandehi. Dr Arun Kharel, the medical officer at Basantapur Primary Health Centre in Omsatiya Rural Municipality Ward No. 4, says a fewer number of pregnant women are visiting health posts for deliveries since the pandemic hit. “Women have started to opt for home births, as they fear contracting Covid-19 when visiting health institutions. This stands to affect the infant mortality rate,” Kharel said. Sixty-four health posts, five primary health centres and two government hospitals have been providing birthing services in the district.","Published at : November 22, 2020",Tilottama,Sanju Paudel
Murder suspect found hanging inside District Police Office in Banke,"A murder suspect in police custody was found hanging inside a toilet at the District Police Office in Banke on Friday morning.Babulal Raidas of Bankatti in Daduwa Rural Municipality Ward No. 3, Banke, was arrested on the charge of killing a 13-year-old boy of the same village. He was in police custody for the last 25 days.The District Police Office in Banke had filed a murder case and also a case of misbehaving with police officers against Raidas. Relatives of the deceased have demanded an investigation into the case citing the incident as suspicious. Deputy Superintendent of Police at the District Police Office Subash Khadka said, “Raidas was arrested on a murder charge. But a case of misdemeanor was also filed against him for misbehaving with police personnel during interrogation.”According to him, Raidas committed suicide at 5:30am on Friday using a headscarf he had with him. Relatives of the deceased, however, have accused the police of foul play. They claim that the deceased was tortured in police custody leading to his death. Patilal Raidas, the deceased’s brother-in-law, said, “How can one commit suicide inside the police station with police personnel present. We suspect foul play and demand fair investigation into the case.”According to him, the police also conducted the postmortem of the deceased without informing the relatives. “Raidas had denied police allegations. Police tortured him to make him admit to the crime but he did not. Police also tortured many locals in relation to the murder incident,” said a local leader of Betahani.","Published at : November 20, 2020",Nepalgunj,Thakur Singh Tharu
Construction of Tinau-Danab corridor road begins in Rupandehi,"The construction of a corridor road along the Tinau and Danab rivers has begun in Rupandehi district for the sustainable management of the rivers and development of eco-tourism in the area.According to the Division Road Office in Butwal, 35 kms of the road stretch will be constructed along the Tinau river and 15 kilometres along the Danab river in the first phase. The two-lane road will be constructed on both sides of the rivers. “Two separate construction companies were awarded the contract to build an eight kilometre-road stretch along the Tinau and three kilometres along the Danab river two months ago,” said Krishna Bahadur Kunwar, the spokesperson at the division office. According to him, the government has a long-term plan to extend the Tinau-Danab corridor road to reach the Nepal-India border through the Marchawar area.Kirateshwor Mainachuli Abisa JV in September was awarded the contract to construct the eight-kilometre road along the Tinau river at the cost of Rs 524.6 million. The contractor has to complete the construction work within 36 months from the signing of the agreement. Similarly, Lama Baniya JV was awarded the contract to construct the three-kilometre corridor road along the Danab river at the cost of Rs 194.2 million with the deadline of 27 months. Kunwar said the construction companies have already started work on the road projects. “Survey work is underway from Zero Point in Butwal Sub-metropolis to Magarghat in Tilottama Municipality along the Tinau river and Belbas to Nayagaun along the Danab river. Construction works will begin once the survey results are out,” said Kunwar. Locals in the area will benefit from the construction of the Tinau-Danab corridor, as there are no motorable roads at present. “The road project will connect various settlements to the road networks. We are happy with the construction of the corridor road,” said Laxmi Prasad Shrestha, a local of Butwal-13.The Department of Roads had prepared a Detailed Project Report (DPR) two years ago for the construction of the Tinau-Danab corridor road. The report shows that it costs around Rs 4.13 billion to complete the construction of the 50 km-long corridor roads. As per the DPR, a retaining wall should be constructed along the banks of the rivers and two-lane roads with the width of seven metres should be constructed on each side of the rivers along with a three-metres-wide berth for plants.The federal government has allocated Rs 450 million for the construction of the Tinau-Danb corridor in the current fiscal year. According to Kunwar, the finance ministry will release additional funds as per the need of the project. “Discussions are underway to award contracts for the construction of other road sections as well. The project will be completed within three years if the required budget is released,” said Kunwar.The government had released Rs 450 million budget for the Tinau-Danab corridor road project in the last fiscal year as well. But the Division Road Office could not sign construction agreements due to eviction issues faced by people living on the banks of both the rivers. According to the office, around 700 houses and sheds should be removed for the construction of the 50km corridor roads along the rivers.“The contracts have been signed this year, as the local units—Butwal Sub-metropolis, Tilottam Municipality and Sainamaina Municipality—took responsibilities of dismantling the structures for the road construction,” said Jayalal Marasini, the chief at the Division Road Office in Butwal. The Tinau river, which originates from Palpa district, bifurcates at Tinau Bridge in Butwal, forming Danab river. The Tinau and Danab again merge when they reach Mayadevi Rural Municipality. Floods in the Tinau and Danab rivers wreak havoc in nearby settlements every monsoon.","Published at : November 20, 2020",Butwal,Amrita Anmol
Cooperative campaign empowers freed Kamalaris in western Tarai districts,"Former Kamalaris—indentured girl child labourers—have been running a number of cooperatives to help each other be financially independent. Many of them have initiated their own businesses thanks to the cooperatives that they own and manage.Manjita Chaudhary, the founding chairperson of the Freed Kamalari Development Forum, said the lives of many Tharu women who had worked as Kamalaris in the past have significantly changed now with the help of the cooperatives. “Most of the freed Kamalaris are involved in various economic activities and running their own businesses. There is no need for them to go to others asking for loans now. Their own cooperatives support them financially if they want to start businesses or learn income-generating activities,” said Manjita.The freed Kamalaris started a cooperative campaign after the government declared free Kamaiyas in July 2000. Forty-seven cooperatives have been established in five western Tarai districts of Dang, Banke, Bardiya, Kailali and Kanchanpur for the upliftment of the former Kamalaris’ economic status.According to the forum, a total of 12,532 former Kamalaris are members of various cooperatives in the western Tarai districts. Lawajuni Saving and Loan Cooperative had been established first in Lamahi of Dang 12 years ago.Many former Kamalaris, who had to work as domestic help to get two square meals a day and clothes, have started their own businesses by taking loans from the cooperatives. According to Manjita, most of the Tharu people used to take loans at high interest rates from local landlords and sent their daughters as Kamalari after failing to pay the money back.Hundreds of former Kamalaris took loans from their cooperatives and started various businesses like goat and pig rearing, vegetable farming, fresh houses, grocery stores, hardware shops and tailoring shops, among others. Bishnu Chaudhary, the central treasurer of the forum, said that the cooperatives provided loans to the members at low interest rates and encouraged them to initiate businesses of their own. According to her, a total of around Rs 88 million have been collected in the cooperatives. Nepal Youth Foundation, an organisation that has been working for the welfare of freed Kamalaris, provided an additional Rs 11.5 million as a revolving fund to the cooperatives.“As many as 1,278 freed Kamalaris took Rs 92.6 million loans to initiate their own businesses,” said Bishnu. According to her, the cooperatives also provide counselling to aspirants wanting to start their own businesses.Nirmala Chaudhary, the forum’s central secretary, said that a total 12,435 freed Kamalaris were present in Dang, Banke, Bardiya, Kailali and Kanchanpur districts alone. But only 4,791 of them have the identity cards issued by the government authority, she added.The umbrella organisation of the former Kamalaris have also underscored the need for education to uplift their life. The forum said a total of 166 freed Kamalaris with no families have been pursuing education in five different hostels. There are two such hostels in Dang and Kailai and one in Kanchanpur. According to Shanti Chaudhary, the forum’s central chairperson, 11 freed Kamalaris hold Master’s degrees, 171 others hold Bachelor’s degrees, 489 have passed secondary level and 97 lower secondary level.","Published at : November 18, 2020",Dang,Durgalal KC
Seven doctors at Butwal Covid-19 Special Hospital resign over allowance issue,"Seven medical officers at Covid-19 Special Hospital in Butwal, Rupandehi, have tendered their resignations after they did not get the promised risk allowance for months.The doctors deployed for the treatment of Covid-19 patients put in their papers on Wednesday. Five of the doctors have not received the risk allowance since July while two others have not received the amount since April. “How long can we work without receiving the allowance? The authority assured us the allowance but we never got them,” said one of the doctors. According to him, they had earlier submitted an application to the authorities concerned asking for the risk allowance. Dr Rajendra Prasad Khanal, the medical superintendent at Lumbini Provincial Hospital, said the medical officers deployed at the Covid-19 Special Hospital halted their works even though the provincial hospital had assured to provide them their due allowance after Tihar. According to Khanal, the provincial hospital had talked to the provincial Social Development Minister Sudarshan Baral after the doctors had submitted the application a few days ago.“We have managed their meals and hotel expenses for now. We will provide them with the allowance immediately after the social development ministry releases the fund,” said Khanal. The provincial government had announced risk allowance for the health workers deployed at Covid-19 special hospitals. Baral said the ministry had sent a written commitment to provide the allowance immediately after it was informed about the doctors’ protest. “The doctors should not halt their work in this situation. They should return to work soon,” he said. The Covid-19 Special Hospital at Butwal Thread Industry has a total of 107 staff including seven doctors and six health assistants. The 54-bed hospital was set up in April with an objective to provide treatment for the coronavirus patients of Rupandehi, Nawalparasi (West), Kapilvastu, Palpa, Gulmi and Arghakhanchi districts. Currently, 34 Covid-19 patients are receiving treatment there.","Published at : November 13, 2020",Butwal,Amrita Anmol
Patients of chronic ailments and accident injuries deprived of care due to pandemic,"Jitendra Gupta has a 9mm stone in his right kidney that doctors have recommended removing it surgically. But Gupta and his family have decided against the surgery fearing Covid-19 infection.“I need to get the surgery done but I’m afraid of contracting Covid-19 while at the hospital,” said Gupta, a resident of Ramgram Municipality-9 in Nawalparasi (West). “I am also suffering from diabetes and asthma and the hospital is also reluctant to admit patients with these ailments.” According to health workers, elderly patients who are in need of medical treatment have been avoiding hospital visits out of fear of contracting the coronavirus these days. Dr Nurul Hoda, medical superintendent at the district hospital, says the patient flow has decreased significantly in the past few months. “Patients of chronic ailments, especially senior citizens have been greatly affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. Most patients have refrained from seeking regular health checkups,” he said.Debaki Saru, 50, of Sunawal has gallstones and her doctor had recommended her for immediate surgery a few months ago. Like Gupta, she too is scared of going to the hospital. “The coronavirus has been spreading like a wildfire everywhere. The hospital has more risks of disease transmission,” she said. “I will wait one more month.” While patients of chronic ailments are avoiding health facilities, those with accident injuries have been rejected admission at hospitals. Lalmani Kami came to Kohalpur, Banke, from Kalikot for the treatment of his 16-year-old son with serious head injuries. But the neurologist was unavailable so he went to Bheri hospital in Nepalgunj. “But the hospital refused to admit him, citing lack of ICU beds. I spent two days visiting other hospitals,” said Kami, whose son was admitted at Kohalpur Medical College. “We had to wait for five days for his PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) test report and other lab reports before he finally received treatment. The delay could have cost us more than just financial loss,” said Kami.Besides daily health services, the pandemic has also affected immunisation drives in health posts across Lumbini Province, say health workers.Immunisation services at a health post in Niglihawa, Kapilvastu, have come to a halt after seven health workers tested positive for Covid-19 on October 21. The next day the health post was closed until November 6. Around 200 children below two years of ages have been deprived of vaccinations including Polio, BCG, DPT and Hepatitis after the health post halted its vaccination programme.“One of the seven employees at the health post recently tested positive for Covid-19. The health post is running with two employees now,” Hariram Chaudhary, chief at the health post, said. According to Maharani Chaudhary, an auxiliary nurse midwife at the health post, they are working under pressure due to the lack of staff. Shiva Bahadur Wagle, ward-9 of Kapilvastu Municipality said they have informed the District Health Office about the situation.“We have also informed the office about the Covid-19-caused disruption in the regular immunisation programme,” he added. Immunisation services in Bake and Bardiya have also been affected due to the coronavirus pandemic. Since the health workers are focused on treating Covid-19 patients, other regular patients are not getting medical care from several health facilities.According to the District Health Office in Banke, regular vaccinations have been lowered by 15 percent now. “The immunisation programme has been affected since the start of the pandemic. We were providing 11 types of vaccines free of cost through various health posts in the district but we have stopped that for now,” said Dhirjang Shah, chief at the office. In Nepalgunj Sub-metropolitan City, the immunisation programme has been limited to 79 percent. Likewise, vaccination services in Kajura, Baijnath, Rapti, Sonari and Kohalpur have also been affected. “If the immunisation campaign can be taken to people’s doorstep, these problems can be solved,” said Shah. Gaunghar Clinic of Siktahan Health Post at ward-12 of Devdaha Municipality in Rupandehi district halted its immunisation programme for a month due to the Covid-19 pandemic.“We had to halt the immunisation programme in March. Services for pregnant women had also been affected for some time. But now, we have resumed the immunisation programme by following preventive health measures”, said Resham Sunar, chief at the health post.Sanju Paudel in Rupandehi, Manoj Paudel in Kapilvastu, Birendra KC in Arghakhanchi, Madhu Shahi in Banke and Thakur Singh Tharu in Bardiya contributed reporting.","Published at : November 13, 2020",Parasi,Nabin Paudel
Twenty-five landslide displaced families to get new homes this Dashain,"As many as 25 families displaced by last year’s landslide at Satyawati Rural Municipality in Gulmi district are getting new homes this Dashain.The construction of houses has been completed in Limgha and Thulolumpek settlements with the financial assistance of the federal, provincial and local governments. Another 27 houses are still under construction and likely to be completed within a month. “Ten new houses in Thulolumpek and 15 others in Limgha have been completed. We are preparing to hand over these houses to the landslide displaced families on the day of Bijaya Dashami on October 26,” said Parishwor Dhakal, chairman of Satyawati Rural Municipality. Two separate landslides in Limgha and Thulolumpek had claimed 13 lives and displaced around 100 families last year. The local government had identified 79 houses as vulnerable to landslides and decided to relocate them as well.According to Dan Bahadur Rana, the ward chairman of Ward No 4, an integrated settlement has been constructed for 27 households of Thulolumpek while 14 houses have been constructed at Khotdanda for the displaced families of Limgha. The local government had provided Rs 500,000 each to the families whose homes were completely destroyed in the landslide while the provincial government had provided Rs 350,000 each to the families whose homes were partially damaged.The local government had purchased land to build integrated settlements for the landslide displaced families with the financial help from the federal government, various social organisations and individual donors.According to Ruk Bahadur Rana, the ward chairman of Ward No 3, the local government had provided Rs 4 million and the provincial government Rs 6.6 million to construct houses for the displaced families of Thulolumpek. “We need more funds to construct homes for the remaining displaced families. We have asked the provincial government for support,” he said Ruk Bahadur.","Published at : October 22, 2020",Gulmi,Ghanashyam Gautam
Bardia National Park counts on technology to protect its wildlife,"Bardia National Park has turned to technology to protect its valuable wildlife and check illegal movement of people inside the park and prevent poaching activities.As part of this initiative, the park, which is home to the second largest population of tigers in the country, has installed cameras at critical locations to track movements inside core areas.According to Ashim Thapa, information officer at the park, there are 64 CCTV cameras installed at crucial locations to track the movement of people as well as wild animals.“These cameras have been installed over the years and placed in areas where people and wild animals move about frequently,” Thapa told the Post from Bardia. “These cameras have been placed in core areas as well as on the outskirts to keep a watch on suspicious movements around the park.”The CCTV footage is closely monitored by a joint command operation cell consisting of Nepal Army and park officials. Likewise, the park has also set up 50 camera traps to observe the movement of wild animals and study their behaviours, according to Thapa.“These cameras have been placed inside core areas as well as near the East-West Highway to study how wild animals roam the area,” said Thapa. “These are the same cameras used during tiger counts, but these cameras have been installed to study their behaviour.”In addition to this, the park has been relying heavily on eight spy cameras used to also monitor activities outside the park. “These cameras are placed secretly and are also frequently moved from one location to another,” said Thapa. “These cameras have been really handy in capturing the movement of poachers and intruders inside the park.”The spy cameras are connected to the internet and footage is sent to officials via email. Once the pictures are received, security forces and park officials are immediately mobilised, according to Thapa.Bardia National Park, spread across 968 sq km, is home to 87 tigers, 29 one-horned rhinos as per their respective latest census of 2018 and 2015. The park has seen a remarkable increase in tiger population over the years. But the park continues to face conservation challenges, especially from poachers.“With the help of our spy cameras, we could track and capture people carrying woods, fishing nets, axes, and other local poaching gear,” said Thapa. “During the lockdown, such movements and activities were rampant. People had entered without permission. We could capture people red-handed inside the park. We have even filed cases against such culprits.”Joint teams from the park and the Nepal Army also conduct ground-level sweep operations frequently. Each post has to conduct two sweeping operations every week, according to Thapa. Also, realtime smart patrolling has also been going on in Bardia Park to minimise potential threats to wildlife.“We have been implementing all these measures to discourage movement inside the park,” said Thapa. “But we had seen an increase in such activities during the lockdown when outsiders were entering the park. The threat is still there as the festive season has come, and many people will be returning to their homes.”","Published at : October 22, 2020",Kathmandu,Chandan Kumar Mandal
"Despite spending millions on Covid-19 prevention and control, Lumbini has little to show for it","The Lumbini provincial government has spent nearly half a billion rupees for the prevention and control of Covid-19 so far, but the rate of disease spread has not slowed down in the province, nor are the patients getting quality care.According to the data of the Ministry of Social Development in the province, Rs 495.2 million has been spent to combat Covid-19 so far. Officials say a large chunk of this amount was spent on procurement of medical equipment and medicines for government hospitals and health facilities.But despite making a big investment to improve and strengthen the medical care infrastructure in the province, patients are not getting admittance in government-run health facilities designated for Covid-19 care and treatment.Forty-three-year-old Rishi Sharma, a local of Butwal Ward No 11, tested positive for Covid-19 two weeks ago. When he sought admission in government hospitals in Rupandehi following severe illness, every one of them turned him away saying they did not have enough beds.“I was staying in home isolation but I had difficulty breathing after a couple of days. I needed medical assistance so I first sought admission at government hospitals but none of them had a bed for me,” he said. “I was then admitted to Universal Medical College in Bhairahawa, a private institution. I spent nine days at the hospital and spent Rs 20,000 per day.”Lumbini Province has four Covid-19 special hospitals in Butwal, Bhairahawa, Dang and Banke districts to treat critical patients from 12 districts. There are also 13 hospitals, 12 district health offices and 12 Ayurvedic hospitals that have isolation facilities. According to the data of the Ministry of Social Development, the provincial government has invested Rs 216.1 million for the management of four Covid-19 special hospitals and Rs 109.84 million on risk allowances for front line health workers.But none of the government health institutions has been able to accommodate the rising number of Covid-19 patients. Currently, there are 195 beds in four Covid-19 special hospitals in Butwal, Bhairahawa, Dang and Banke. The active number of cases across the province reached 3,719 as of Friday.Until Friday, 14,490 individuals have been tested positive for the coronavirus in the province. Of the total infected, only 1,085 people were able to get treatment at Covid-19 special hospitals. Among them, 66 succumbed to the disease during the course of treatment. According to the records kept by the Provincial Health Directorate in Lumbini, 15 Covid-19 patients died for want of treatment because they were turned away by Covid-19 special hospitals, citing lack of beds.Two months ago, a Cabinet meeting issued a directive to hospitalise only symptomatic patients while asymptomatic patients would be asked to isolate at home. Following the directive, free swab collection was also stopped in the province. Dr Pushparaj Paudel, information officer at the Ministry of Social Development, believes the number of Covid-19 patients may be higher than what’s being reported daily. “These days even those who are entering the province do not have to conduct mandatory PCR tests,” said Dr Binod Kumar Giri, the health director of the province. “PCR tests of asymptomatic patients have also been stopped. We are conducting free PCR tests only on critical patients.” The provincial government has provided seven ventilators to three Covid-19 special hospitals (Bhairahawa, Dang and Banke) in the province. The Butwal-based Covid-19 special hospital has five ventilators. There are only 12 ventilators throughout the province. A majority of Covid-19 patients have been asked to stay in home isolation but since there are no mechanisms to provide medical assistance to Covid-19 patients staying at home, most of them are unaware of changes in their medical condition. There are 2,165 Covid-19 patients in home isolation who have not received any health services or medical care from the government. “I did a PCR test in Lumbini Provincial Hospital after suffering from a high fever about three weeks ago. My report was positive. I stayed in home isolation for 14 days,” said Sushmita Pandey, a resident in Ward No. 6 of Siddharthanagar Municipality. “None of the authorities checked up on me so I had to monitor my health improvement myself.” The provincial government says it will soon introduce plans to better the current medical infrastructure keeping in mind the chances of further spread of the virus during the festive season. It, however, does not have plans to increase the scope of PCR tests, or monitor the health condition of patients in home isolation. “The government is going to expand and increase health services in Covid-19 hospitals,” said Baijanath Chaudhary, spokesperson of the provincial government. “But there are no plans yet to extend the same services to those in home isolation.” Sudarshan Baral, minister for Social Development in the province, said the ministry has released funds as per the demand of the health facilities so it is not the lack of money that has stunted the health sector in the province. “We have been providing the necessary funds to all Covid-19 specific and other hospitals to equip them to fight the pandemic,” said Baral. But since there’s no proper mechanism to inspect and monitor the expenditures of the hospitals, the funds are not being utilised as needed, says Dr Krishna Kharel, a member at the Medical Council at the central level. “Even though hospitals have purchased medical equipment, the failure to manage skilled human resources in health facilities has rendered the investment null,” said Kharel. “The government is injecting funds in hospitals but there is no progress to show for all the money spent. The spending has not been result-oriented.” Krishna Bahadur Paudel, an assistant accountant at the Ministry of the Social Development in the province, said out of 495.2 million, Rs 209.92 million was from the Covid-19 fund and the rest of the budget was provided by the provincial government.","Published at : October 17, 2020",Butwal,Amrita Anmol
Monsoon-battered Siddhartha Highway causes hours long jam,"The number of people travelling to Gulmi, Baglung, Syangja, Kaski and Mustang from Kathmandu and various parts of the country via Siddhartha Highway for the festival season has increased in recent days.But their journey has become a difficult one due to traffic jams. The lack of proper road maintenance for the past several years and this year’s landslides have made travelling a frustrating experience. Major sections of the highway experienced multiple landslides during this year’s rainy season and the authorities are yet to completely clear the debris, which has been causing traffic bottlenecks, sometimes for hours.The highway condition is particularly rough where it passes through Palpa district. Tilak Neupane, who reached Pokhara from Rupandehi last week, complained of being stuck in a six-hour-long traffic jam along the highway. “There are huge mounds of landslide debris by the highway side and in some places landslides have washed away parts of the highway. Travelling on the highway was a nightmare,” he said.According to the Division Road Office in Palpa, road sections at Kadambas, Siddhababa, Damsite, Paithedanda, Bhutkhola, Jhumsa, Panimil and Chaubismile, among other areas, were damaged during this year’s monsoon. Two-way traffic has been blocked in many of these areas. Officials at the road office said the damaged highway sections will not be repaired this year since they do not have funds. “We still have to clear landslide debris and we have limited funds,” said Mukundaraj Adhikari, chief at the rad office.The road office does not expect that the Department of Roads will be issuing funds for the highway repair works anytime soon.“It takes at least six hours to go to Tansen from Butwal these days. Earlier the distance could be covered in almost 45 minutes,” said Sumit Kunwar, a jeep driver. According to the road office, at least 50 to 80 metres of the highway has caved in at several places. “Two-way traffic flow is impossible on these highway sections,” said Janga Bahadur Sunar, supervisor of the road office. “More than 50 metres of the highway in Tinau area has also been swept away by torrential downpour.”The Bhutkhola and Siddhababa sections of the highway had suffered heavy damages during last year’s monsoon too, but the repair works have still not been initiated. “We always face trouble while travelling through Siddhababa section of the highway in Palpa. Last year’s damaged roads have still not been repaired and the area is still prone to landslides,” said Shiva Nepali, a local man of Ribdikot in Palpa. Shiva Sherchan, a bus driver, says he spends four to six hours everyday in traffic jams on the highway. “There are no alternate routes, so we are forced to drive through this dangerous section of the highway,” he said.Traffic jams have worsened due to the frequent movement of trucks carrying limestones, Prithvi Narayan Kafle, chief at the District Traffic Office, said. “Travellers are facing more traffic jams now, as the movement of trucks carrying limestones on the highway has become more frequent since mid-September. On top of that the highway is already in a dilapidated state,” said Kafle. According to the data of the District Traffic Office in Palpa, more than 800 trucks carrying limestones ply the road daily. “These trucks have been contributing to the traffic congestion on the highway. The situation is not going to improve unless the two-way traffic movement on the highway is opened,” said Kunwar.","Published at : October 16, 2020",Palpa,Madhab Aryal
Bhairahawa Covid-19 hospital lacks infrastructure and human resource,"Ten days ago, a Covid-19 patient of Bank Road in Siddharthanagar Municipality Ward No. 5 fell unconscious at his home. The 47-year-old’s family called for an ambulance from the nearby Bhim Hospital. But the hospital did not send the ambulance on time and the patient died for want of treatment.Bhim Hospital in Bhairahawa, also known as the district hospital in Rupandehi, has been running as a Covid-19 Hospital since March. However, the hospital is reeling under a shortage of physical infrastructure and human resources and has been facing difficulties in providing effective services to patients.Dr Shakuntala Gupta, the medical superintendent of the hospital, said, “Ever since the provincial government designated Bhim Hospital as the Covid-19 hospital, we have been having problems in running the hospital effectively. We have received no additional infrastructure or human resources to deal with the pandemic.”According to Gupta, the hospital should have a separate ambulance to carry Covid-19 patients. “But we don’t have a separate ambulance nor do we have enough human resources,” she said.The hospital at present has only one ambulance that is being used to carry pregnant and postpartum women. “The same ambulance that carries Covid-19 patients cannot be used for pregnant and postpartum mothers,” said Gupta.According to the hospital data, around 10 to 12 pregnant women give birth at the hospital on a daily basis. “Among them, three to four women undergo C-section delivery,” Gupta said. “If an ambulance carries a Covid-19 patient, we have to send the driver to stay in quarantine. But we have only one ambulance driver at the hospital. That is why we cannot use our ambulance to carry Covid-19 patients.” The problem is not limited to the ambulance facility. There’s also a shortage of skilled human resources to operate ventilators in the hospital. On September 7, the provincial government provided three ventilators to the hospital but there are no health workers to operate them. Because of this, Covid-19 patients are not receiving ventilator services. “There should be one aesthesist and an assistant to operate the equipment. But have none,” said Dr. Gupta.On September 7, the hospital started operating its ventilators with the help of some health workers from Universal Teaching Hospital, a private hospital in Bhairahawa.“But the health personnel returned to their own hospital within a few days,” said Dr Narayan Pokharel, spokesperson at the hospital. “Our hospital receives three to four Covid-19 patients on a daily basis. But critical patients who need ventilator support cannot be treated here. We have to refer patients to other hospitals if they need ventilator services, as we lack the staff to operate the machine.”Govinda Gyawali, chief at the hospital administration, said, “We have been requesting the ministry to send us an anesthetist and an assistant to operate the ventilators. The ministry said it would send them soon but we have yet to receive any personnel.” According to him, the hospital plans to hire human resources to operate ventilators on its own, as the ministry has delayed sending over the required health workers.Besides Covid-19 patients, around 250 service seekers visit the hospital on a daily basis. The 25-bed hospital is currently running with 95 beds but the number of health workers remains the same.Out of three posts of medical specialists and three posts of medical officers in the hospital, one post of each is still vacant. Out of 10 posts of staff nurses, two are vacant whereas the hospital has only one auxiliary nurse midwife and 16 office assistants.“With limited manpower, we are facing difficulties in treating Covid-19 patients and patients of other ailments. We have been compelled to deploy the same health workers in both the Covid-19 isolation ward and other medical wards,” Gyawali said.According to Dr. Gupta, the hospital needs thrice more health workers and other staffers to provide effective health services to patients of Covid-19 and other ailments.","Published at : October 12, 2020",Bhairahawa,Madhav Dhungana						 &
Two women people’s representatives in Ghorahi join school to learn to read and write,"Yami Kumari Pun of Kalimati in Ghorahi, Dang, has a hectic schedule since he started attending classes to learn to read and write.The 55-year-old ward member of Ghorahi Sub-metropolitan-2 attends school with students her grandchildren’s age. The ward office and her school is only 50 metres apart making her commute easy between her workplace and school. “I never went to school during childhood. I was busy tending to the household chores and when I got married it was my children I got busy with,” said Pun. “Holding public office made me realise the importance of education. That’s why I took admission at the local school.” Pun enrolled herself in grade three at Rampur-based Ganga Secondary School this academic year. She has been attending classes regularly since mid-September when the school administration started classes by maintaining physical distancing. “At first, I felt uncomfortable studying with young children but soon I got used to it,” she said. A mother of four children, Pun says she decided to learn to read and write because she came across many hurdles while implementing her duty as a people’s representative. “I was facing problems formulating plans and allocating budget. I didn’t want to sign the documents of which I had no clue.” Hima Devi BK, 47, of Balim in Ghorahi-2 is one of Pun’s classmates. She is also the elected ward member.“I wasn’t able to sign on documents for work. I wanted to learn to read and write so I joined the school with Pun,” she said. “My husband is also not educated. He works as a construction worker. So it was important for me to get an educated.” According to the teachers at the school, it is a good sign that the people’s representatives despite their age decided to pursue education. It sends a positive message about the importance of education, they say. “The senior members of the class are gradually learning to read and write words. They are slowly getting confident,” said Shreeman Neupane, a teacher at the school. “We decided to enroll them in grade three as they could read and write Nepali alphabets,” he added.A good number of people’s representatives in the local units in the district are illiterate. According to Bharat Aryal, chief at the education unit of Ghorahi Sub-metropolis, only about 80 percent of elected representatives in the sub-metropolis are educated. “But this is going to change. Many people’s representatives at Ward No 2, 3 and 12 have been studying formally in school or taking adult literacy class,” said Aryal.The ward office also hails the efforts of its ward members. “They could hardly write their names. They are now learning to read and write. Their learning will help accelerate the work at the ward office in the future. Their self-confidence has increased as they started formal education in school,” said Keshab Acharya, the ward chairman of Ghorahi-2.","Published at : October 9, 2020",Dang,Durgalal KC

The protesters chanted anti-government slogans and warned the leaders to respect people’s sentiments.Addressing the corner meeting, Khim Bahadur Hamal, the chairman of the joint struggle committee, said that the government has decided to shift the provincial capital from Butwal by ignoring the contributions of the private sectors. Butwal is the temporary capital of the province. “The business community even provided their private buildings to the government. We will not accept the government’s decision at any cost,” he said. The main opposition, Nepali Congress, called a general strike in Rupandehi on Sunday as a protest to the government's decision.

Decrease in tracing and testing efforts puts public health at risk in Province 5,"On September 20, a 70-year-old man of Sukhkhanagar Ward 8 in Butwal visited a local clinic with complaints of fever and cough. Although he showed symptoms of Covid-19, the physician at the clinic advised him to take medicines for viral fever since the patient had no travel history and there were no reported Covid-19 cases in his locality.Five days later, the patient exhibited respiratory problems and was taken to Lumbini Provincial Hospital for a swab test. He tested positive for the coronavirus and was shifted to the provincial Corona Special Hospital. A week since the patient’s diagnosis, tracing of those who came in contact with him is yet to be done. The Butwal Sub-metropolis has stated that contact tracing will only be done if the suspects show symptoms of the virus. In another instance, a 50-year-old man of Manigram in Tilottama Municipality Ward 8 tested positive for the coronavirus in the first week of September. The patient had stayed in home isolation for nine days before being moved to the ICU of the provincial Coronavirus Hospital on September 19. He died two days later while undergoing treatment.His family members tested positive for the virus three days after his death and his neighbours a week later. Had the family members’ tests been conducted while the patient was in home isolation, the virus would have been contained within the family, local residents say.“If the family members had known that they were also infected, they wouldn’t have moved about. The virus would not have spread in the community,” said Laxman Khatri, a local entrepreneur. “The government’s decision to lower the scope of contact tracing and the rate of testing is putting the public at health risk.” Between April and August, Kapilvastu, Banke, Dang and Rupandehi districts reported hundreds of Covid-19 cases per day. The authorities used to collect swab samples from the affected areas and test them on a daily basis. But now only around 650 PCR tests are being conducted on a daily basis, according to the data of the Ministry of Social Development. According to health workers in Kapilvastu Municipality, the isolation facility in Taulihawa, the district headquarters of Kapilvastu, has been vacant since Saturday. Umesh Gupta, coordinator at the health section of Kapilvastu Municipality, says that the municipality does not have any critical Covid-19 patients, but the number of active cases in the local unit is 79.“At the beginning of last month, the government stopped conducting contact tracing and the local units have also slowed down PCR testing,” said Gupta. “Although the number of active cases seems low, there is no telling how many people are infected since not enough tests are being conducted”Until September 8, the provincial government conducted tests from six different places in the province. Around 800 swab samples used to be collected on a daily basis. Since mid-September, the province has been collecting swab samples from nine different places but the number of samples being collected has decreased. On Wednesday, only 609 swab samples were collected from various locations.Govinda Khanal, senior central vice chairman of the Human Rights and Peace Society, says the government is making a mistake by slowing down tests in the province.“Currently there is no contact tracing of suspects and the rate of PCR tests has gone down. It looks like the government has surrendered to the virus,” he said. “Hospitals, clinics and doctors have also started to treat patients for seasonal flu without checking for coronavirus infection.”Dr Bishnu Gautam, information officer at the Covid-19 centre in Lumbini Provincial Hospital, says the number of critical patients has started to increase in the hospital after the government stopped contact tracing. “Since there is no tracing and testing, Covid-19 patients reach the hospital only when their health deteriorates,” he said. “The government should not stop contact tracing and testing. Treatment of the infected is only possible when the patients know that they are infected.”According to him, there are 57 critical Covid-19 patients in the hospital at present. “Three patients are on ventilator support while 29 others are receiving oxygen. Twenty-five patients are in the ICU facility,” said Gautam.Dr Pushparaj Paudel, spokesperson for the Ministry of Social Development, however, claims that the province has not lowered the rate of PCR tests but that it is adhering to the standard issued by the provincial government in the first week of September. According to the standard, only patients with symptoms will be tested by the local units. “The government is currently focused on treating symptomatic and critical patients,” he said. The government is preparing to add ICU beds and ventilators in various hospitals in the province. “We are conducting contact tracing and PCR tests of those who fall within the government guidelines.”“If one member of a family tests positive for the virus, we test other members only if the patient shows symptoms within seven days of home isolation,” said Paudel. “We follow the same procedure for contact tracing.”The total number of Covid-19 cases stands at 10,720 in the province with 2,144 active cases. The death toll in the province has reached 83 as of Thursday. Manoj Paudel in Kapilvastu contributed reporting.","Published at : October 2, 2020",Rupandehi,Ghanashyam Gautam
People rendered homeless await resettlement in Musikot,"Govinda Sarki and his family from Musikot in Gulmi have been taking shelter at a local school building after a landslide destroyed their house and property on July 2.The Sarki family, along with 15 other families from Musikot village, was displaced by the July 2 landslide. They have been taking shelter at Shree Nera Tribhuvan Secondary School for the last two-and-a-half months.“All my properties were swept away by the landslide. I have nothing left now. We don’t know where to go after the school reopens,” Govinda said. According to the displaced families, they are barely surviving with the help of reliefs provided by Musikot Municipality. “We don’t know when my house will get swept away. The house and the courtyard have developed cracks in the landslide,” said Nanda Bahadur Sarki, another displaced victim. “The landslide has made us refugees. The entire settlement has developed cracks. There’s no safe place for us in the village.” The entire village is at high risk of landslides, as it lies on steep land, the villagers say.Following the landslide, Musikot villagers have been demanding the municipal office to move them to a safer location. Sudip Khatri, a displaced victim of Musikot Ward No. 2, said he has been taking shelter at his relative’s house in a neighboring village since the disaster. “It's been almost three months that we left our settlement. But the municipality has not done anything to resettle us. We are feeling neglected,” said Khatri, requesting the government to take the matter seriously.Dhal Bahadur Khatri, a displaced victim of Musikot Ward No. 2, said, “We cannot stay in our settlement now, as it is at risk of landslides. The authorities concerned need to move us to a safe location.”Out of a total of 50 households in the ward, 20 have been displaced by the landslide. “The July 2 landslide displaced 16 households and the remaining four were displaced by the landslides triggered by rainfalls in the last three days,” said Laxman Khatri, the ward chairman. “Some of the displaced families are taking shelter at a school building while some are staying at their relatives’ houses. There is no other alternative than to relocate the families to a safer location.”According to Musikot Municipality Mayor Somnath Sapkota, his office is searching for safe locations for the resettlement of the displaced households. “We, in coordination with the provincial government, plan to develop an integrated settlement for the displaced households,” Sapkota said.

The landslide also swept away our fields,” said Saraswati Thapa, a displaced local. There was no human casualty in the devastating landslide since the villagers had evacuated the settlement on time, said Thapa. “But we only had that house and the plot of land. Now the entire settlement is sinking and we don’t know where to go,” she said.The land on which the settlement stands continued caving in on Sunday as well.

According to him, 54 families have been shifted to a local school and a meadow. “Only 16 houses in the settlement are safe now. But they will also be at risk if the land continues sinking,” Gaire said.Around 700 ropanis of arable land, according to Gaire, has been damaged by the landslide. “All the resources have been mobilised to pitch tents and provide relief to the displaced families. They should be resettled to a safe location, as their settlement is not safe,” said municipality Mayor Surya Prasad Adhikari.“I have been staying in a nearby meadow with my four family members.

Tiger carcass found inside Bardiya National Park,"Bardiya National Park on Friday made public its discovery of a tiger carcass inside the park. The incident, park officials say, is indicative of poachers being active in the park area.The decomposed carcass was found by the park’s patrol team in Lamkali Phant near Pakuwa village in Thakurbaba Municipality Ward No. 7 on Thursday. The dead tiger is estimated to be about five years.“Poachers might have set the trap for wild boars and Chitals,"" said Bishnu Shrestha, the chief conservation officer of the park. ""The tiger must have been killed at least a month ago. We are investigating how the poachers managed to set a trap in the park area."" According to Shrestha, the incident site is about five kilometres from the park headquarters in Thakurdwara. A Nepal Army battalion has been stationed for the security of the park.Locals and conservationists have raised serious concerns about poachers being active in the park and have questioned the park officials on their failure to come across the carcass sooner despite claims of strict patrolling inside the park. In the count of 2018, there were 87 tigers in the park which is spread across 968 square kilometre. According to officials, the population of tigers in the park could be around 100 now. Although Nepal, which is among the 12 countries that pledged to double its tiger population between 2009-2022, has made much progress in achieving its goal, poaching remains one of the greatest challenges the country faces in its conservation efforts, say conservationists.","Published at : September 26, 2020",Bardiya,Kamal Panthi
Pregnant women and postpartum mothers hit hardest by Covid-19 pandemic,"Pregnant women and postpartum mothers have been hit hardest by the Covid-19 pandemic, as they have been deprived of timely treatment.Seven women died of delivery complications in Banke in the span of two months. According to the District Health Office, a lack of timely treatment and regular health check-ups during pregnancy is the leading cause behind the alarming deaths of pregnant women and postpartum mothers.[Read: Reproductive health gains at risk as 85 pregnant women die due to lack of care in last five months]“The number of deaths in just two months is very alarming. It seems that the women delayed their hospital visits due to the fear of Covid-19. Some pregnant women even attempted home births during the pandemic, which led to further complications,” said Dhirjung Shah, chief at the District Health Office in Banke. According to him, the number of people who have opted for home birth has increased by around 20 percent during the pandemic.Several pregnant women have been deprived of regular health checkups since the country went into lockdown amid Covid-19 fear on March 24. Many women, mainly from poor economic backgrounds, could not manage transportation to reach health facilities on time. “Many others preferred not to visit health institutions fearing that they might contract the virus,” said Shah. Three women of Janaki Rural Municipality, two of Nepalgunj Sub-metropolis and one each of Duduwa and Baijanath rural municipalities in the district died due to delivery-related complications in the last six months. Sah said three of the women died in Bheri Hospital and one in Nepalgunj Teaching Hospital. Two women from Duduwa and Baijanath breathed their last on their way to a hospital while one of the two women from Nepalgunj died during home birth. The provincial government has launched a special health programme in Banke to reduce maternal and infant mortality rate. The government has been providing Rs 800 to a woman who undergoes complete health check ups during pregnancy and an additional Rs 1,000 if she gives birth at a health facility. However, most pregnant women were found to have skipped prenatal check ups during the lockdown period. According to health workers, a pregnant woman has to undergo health checkups at least four times—in the fourth, sixth, eighth and ninth month of her pregnancy. “The health risk is significantly low if a woman gets a regular health check up during pregnancy. But the number of women visiting hospitals for regular health checkups and safe delivery has decreased during the pandemic,” said Durga Laxmi Shrestha, chief nursing administrator at Bheri Hospital in Nepalgunj. Regular health checkups and timely admission of patients at health institutions will decrease the mortality rate of pregnant women and postpartum mothers. According to Shrestha, most of the women give up regular health checkups during pregnancy after the first or second test. “However, there are other factors too that contribute to the high mortality rate among pregnant women. A lack of health awareness and poverty are also why women give up regular health checkups during pregnancy,” she said.Besides Bheri Hospital and Nepalgunj Medical College, there are three primary health centres and 44 health posts in Banke district. Maternity centre has been set up in each health institution to provide a safe motherhood facility.Meanwhile, Bishnu Shrestha, the focal person of the safe motherhood programme at the district health office, said that all the health posts have been instructed to refer pregnant women to hospitals for safe delivery. “The number of deaths caused by delivery complications is unchecked, as the patients are not taken to the hospital on time,” she said.","Published at : September 22, 2020",Nepalgunj,Thakur Singh Tharu
Nepal and India begin joint security patrol along border in Kapilvastu,"Security forces of Nepal and India have initiated a joint security patrol of the Nepal-India border in Kapilvastu district to control the spread of Covid-19 and check illegal cross-border activities.The local administration said security along the sealed border has been heightened in light of possible illegal cross-border movement and smuggling. A joint security patrol of Nepal Police and Armed Police Force of Nepal and Seema Suraksha Bal of India has begun from Saturday.The central committee of the Covid-19 Crisis Management Centre recently decided that it will continue to seal the Nepal-India border until November 14. Following the decision, the security forces initiated the joint security patrol. Twenty-six security personnel each from both the countries have been deployed on the border.“The Indian side took our security concerns along the border positively. So we have initiated the joint border patrol,” said Pratap Paudel, inspector at the Area Police Office in Krishnanagar.Krishnanagar is one of the major points along the Nepal-India border. The Indian side has committed to tightening security to control criminal activities along the open border, said Paudel.On Saturday, APF Inspector Niranjan Karki led Nepali troops while Sumit Harit, in-charge of the border outpost in Badhani of India, led the Indian security team and patrolled the border area between Border Pillar No 567 and 569. During the joint security patrol, the security personnel also urged the locals to stay on high alert, as Covid-19 cases are on the rise in both the countries.","Published at : September 21, 2020",Kapilvastu,Manoj Paudel
Industries begin operations in Province 5 with local labour force,"Many foreign migrant workers employed in cement and steel industries in Rupandehi left for their home country when the pandemic hit and the nationwide lockdown was put in place back on March 24. Most of these migrant workers were from India. The vacuum created by their departure is now being filled by workers from within the country, according to the Province Planning Commission in Province 5.The data available at the commission showed that more than 200,000 migrant workers in Nepal have returned to India and overseas in the last five months. “There was a dearth of workers in factories since most migrants from India went back home. But Nepali workers have gradually started working in their stead,” said Ishwor Gautam, the vice-chairperson of the commission.Although the commission does not have the updated data on all Nepali returnees who are in need of employment, it will soon have the final figures, says Gautam. “We plan to create jobs and open employment opportunities for the returnees. We are coordinating with the local units to update the data,” Gautam said.Before the pandemic, most cement and steel factories, among other industries, in Rupandehi had 80 percent workforce from India since the locals used to migrate abroad in search of jobs. But the scenario has been changed since the pandemic. “A large chunk of the workforce in various brick kilns and factories in Rupandehi used to be from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and other states of India. Now locals are working in those factories,” said Gautam.According to Bidur Dhungana, general secretary at the Western Cement Manufacturers Association, there were around 5,000 to 6,000 foreign migrant workers in various cement and steel industries in Rupandehi and Kapilvastu districts before the lockdown.“Out of around 40,000 workers in 200 brick kilns, at least 35,000 were from India. But since most of them have returned to their native country, local Nepalis are filling up the vacant positions,” said Thanseshwor Ghimire, chairman of the Federation of Nepal Brick Industries in Province 5. In the past, locals preferred going abroad for employment, creating a dearth of manpower in the local industries. “But now, Nepali workers from Rupandehi and other parts of the country have started arriving here for work,” said Dhungana, who is also the managing director of Jagadamba Cement. Bal Krishna Pandey, 32, a resident of Mayadevi-3 in Rupandehi, said he used to work in a pipe factory in Gujarat, India, before he came back to Nepal some five months ago.“Now I work at a local steel industry in the Lumbini Corridor,” said Pandey. “There is not much of a difference in the earning that I made in India and what I am making here so I’ve decided to stay back.” All industries in Rupandehi, Nawalparasi (West) and Kapilvastu districts were shut down for two months after the start of the nationwide lockdown in the country. According to Dhungana, most of the industries have now reopened and are being run by the local labour force.There are 11 cement factories and more than one-and-a-half dozen industries in the Lumbini Corridor. “We now have around 3,000 Nepalis working in the corridor. We expect the workforce to grow once the industries start producing to their maximum capacity,” said Dhungana.Likewise, there are 11 steel industries in Rupandehi, Nawalparasi and Kapilvastu districts. “Nepali workers have started visiting our factories in search of jobs. Since most of our workers have returned to their native countries, we have started employing more Nepalis in our factories,” said Suraj Upreti, operator of SR Steel Industry in Madauliya, Rupandehi. Similarly, industries in the Lumbini Corridor have also started receiving workers from Palpa, Dadeldhura, Bhojpur and Dhangadhi. Sher Baha Gaha, 38, of Palpa Dovan, said he used to work as a daily wage worker in New Delhi before he returned home following the Covid-19 pandemic. Now he works at a steel factory in the Lumbini Corridor. “I stayed home in Palpa for almost two months due to the nationwide lockdown. But I needed to work to look after my family. So in mid-July, I came to the Lumbini Corridor and started working in one of the steel factories,” said Gaha. “I used to earn Rs 20,000 in India working 16 hours a day. Here I make the same amount of money and I only put in 10 to 12 hours per day.”Meanwhile, Arghakhanchi Cement has also started appointing local workers from the Lumbini area and from Siyari Rural Municipality in Rupandehi, where its factory is situated. Uddhav Bahadur Karki, managing director at the factory, said, “We are communicating with the rural municipality chairman to find out the exact number of unemployed youths in Siyari. The factory has started deploying local workers in cement production.”","Published at : September 11, 2020",Bhairahawa,Madhav Dhungana
Delay in test reports hinders contact tracing in Kapilvastu,"People suspected with coronavirus infection in Kapilvastu still have to wait for at least 10 days to get their test results. This delay has caused difficulties in expediting contact tracing and also risked the safety of other people in communities.On Monday, a Kapilvastu-based journalist died while he was waiting for his test result. The 62-year-old from Kapilvastu Municipality Ward No 1 had given his swab samples for a test on August 29. He passed away while undergoing treatment at the district hospital in Taulihawa. He had pre-existing kidney ailment, high blood pressure and diabetes.""We came to know about the infection only after his death,” said one of his family members. “We would have isolated him and given him treatment accordingly if we had known about the infection. We would also have ensured our own safety.” A team of health officials from Kapilvastu Municipality had collected the swabs of the deceased man after one of his family members had tested positive for the disease. The team had also taken swab samples from seven others through contact tracing. According to the health unit of the municipality, the swab samples of 78 people were sent to the Public Health Laboratory in Bhairahawa in the past two weeks.""So far, we have received the test results of only six people,"" said Umesh Gupta, the coordinator of the health unit. ""We must expedite contact tracing, especially after the test result of the deceased came positive. But we haven’t been able to do so since we are yet to receive the test results.” Test results of 74 people are awaited in Banganga Municipality as well. ""We collected the swabs on September 1 and sent them to the Provincial Hospital in Butwal,"" said Thagaraj Paudel, the health coordinator of the municipality.Likewise, 60 suspected coronavirus infected people in Krishnanagar Municipality are also waiting for the test results since Thursday. According to Dr Rajendra Giri, chief at the Public Health Laboratory in Bhairahawa, the lab should ideally be able to release the test reports within 48 to 72 hours, but these days the lab has been overburdened. “The lab has been stretched too thin because we have been receiving swab samples from several districts. We get hundreds of swabs for testing daily and we have just one machine that can conduct 96 tests per day,” he said. The coronavirus tests are being conducted in Bhairahawa, Butwal, Nepalgunj and Dang districts of Province 5.","Published at : September 9, 2020",Kapilvastu,Manoj Paudel
Frontline health workers in Kapilvastu deprived of risk allowance,"A staff nurse at the Kapilvastu District Hospital got infected with Covid-19 for the second time in August. She had first contracted the virus in May and had stayed in the hospital’s isolation ward before recovering and going back to work.As per an announcement made by the Ministry of Health and Population, health workers deployed in the frontline are to get a risk allowance equivalent to their salary. The nurse, however, has yet to get her risk allowance.An auxiliary health worker at Birpur Health Post in Shivaraj Municipality also tested positive for coronavirus last month. He said he was infected while he was deployed at a quarantine facility set up at Nepal Rastriya Secondary School in Chandrauta. He too has yet to receive any allowance from the government. In fact none of the health workers deployed in the frontline in Kapilvastu have received their risk allowance.A total of 40 health workers in Kapilvastu have been infected with Covid-19 as of Saturday.With the spike in cases in the community and the high risk of virus transmission, some health workers in the district have set up coronavirus insurance in their own initiatives by paying premiums themselves, according to Ratnakar Shukla, the manager at Kapilvastu District Hospital. “We have to bear the cost of coronavirus insurance ourselves, as the authorities concerned have ignored frontline workers,” Shukla said.As many as 30 health workers at the district hospital tested positive for the virus, which had led to the closing of the hospital for two weeks from August 10. None of those infected health workers got any kind of allowance from the government.""I was infected with Covid-19 while providing treatment to coronavirus patients,"" said Dr Kishwor Banjade, the medical superintendent at the hospital. “However, the government has been neglecting the health workers who are working in the frontline to contain the virus.”Pashupatimani Tripathi, a Kapilvastu-based rights activist, argued that the provincial government should be responsible to provide coronavirus insurance facilities to health workers, as the district hospital is run by the provincial government. ""The provincial government should encourage health workers in the frontline and provide them with additional facilities and incentives,"" said Tripathi. Meanwhile, the District Health Office said that it wrote to the provincial government a few weeks ago to provide coronavirus insurance facilities to the health workers. ""But the provincial government has yet to respond,"" said Yogendra Bhagat, chief at the health office.Kapilvastu, a district in Province 5, is the hotspot for Covid-19 in the country.

Coronavirus patients in home isolation in Rupandehi complain of being neglected by authorities,"A 68-year-old woman from Tilottama Municipality Ward No. 5 in Rupandehi had tested positive for Covid-19 in the third week of August. A patient of diabetes and high blood pressure, she had been staying in home isolation despite her doctor suggesting she be placed in a hospital, as there were no beds available at the corona-specific hospital in Butwal. She died on Sunday, while on her way to Bhim Hospital in Bhairahawa.“We didn’t have a choice but to keep her at home despite her doctor suggesting otherwise. The municipality did not help us secure a bed in the isolation facility at the corona-specific hospital in Butwal,” said Ram Bahadur Gurung, one of the family members of the deceased. “On Sunday, her health condition worsened and we again asked the municipality to help us take her to the hospital. But they said all ICU beds in the hospital were taken.” Gurung says the woman died due to the municipality’s neglect. ""The authorities shirk their responsibility of coronavirus patients staying in home isolation. Despite our repeated requests, the municipality did not manage a bed for her in the isolation centre, where she would have received better care and treatment,” Gurung said. Ishwori Paudel, the corona focal person of the municipality, admitted the municipality’s failure in helping the elderly woman with preexisting health conditions. ""We were concerned about her condition. But we could not take her to the hospital since there was no bed available,"" said Paudel.Another virus-infected man staying in home isolation in Siddhartha Municipality Ward No. 8, Rupandehi, said he too is disappointed in the authorities’ response to patients staying in home isolation. ""I was suffering from fever and dizziness a few days ago. I called the municipality’s health workers multiple times but they did not answer. One person finally received my call in the evening and suggested that I drink hot water and eat nutritious food. But nobody came to check up on me,"" said the man. “We only need health consultation. But the authorities here have failed to provide us with even that.""A total of 140 people tested positive for coronavirus in Siddharthanagar Municipality as of Tuesday morning with 84 active cases. Fifty-eight of them are in home isolation. Uma Thapa, chief at the health unit of the municipality, said that health workers have been unable to reach out to every patient in home isolation for a lack of manpower and resources such as ambulances and hospital beds. She, however, claimed that health workers were in regular contact with patients through phone calls.The number of patients staying in home isolation has increased in several districts of Province 5, as the existing hospitals in the province are already filled to their capacity. The province has only four corona-specific hospitals and 138 isolation centres to cover 12 districts. There are two corona-specific hospitals in Rupandehi district and one each in Butwal and Bhairahawa. According to the Social Development Ministry, a total of 531 people are currently staying in home isolation in Province 5. As per the home isolation management regulation, health workers should immediately reach out to patients staying in home isolation and should inform the authorities about any health complications in the patient.Dr Pushpa Raj Paudel, the information officer at the ministry, claimed that the authorities allow patients to stay in home isolation only after monitoring their health condition and after ensuring their houses meet the standard required for home isolation. “A health team first inspects the patient’s house and their physical condition. Only then are they allowed to stay in home-isolation,” he claimed.","Published at : September 4, 2020",Rupandehi,Amrita Anmol						 &
Federal government injecting budget into district hospitals in haste without proper study,"The federal government has decided to upgrade Arghakhanchi and Kapilvastu district hospitals as Covid-specific hospitals. However, both the designated hospitals suffer from poor infrastructure, limited human resources, and a shortage of medical equipment.On Monday, the Ministry of Health and Population decided to provide Rs 20 million each to Arghakhanchi and Kapilvastu district hospitals to upgrade the institutions with four ventilators and 10 ICU beds each. The district hospital building in Arghakhanchi, which was established 33 years ago, still has a zinc-sheet roof. On a daily basis, the hospital receives 200 patients but has the capacity to admit only 15 patients to the inpatient care department. “The federal government has decided to provide Rs 20 million to upgrade the hospital. But we don’t know what to do and how to prepare to handle Covid-19 patients,” Dr Kapil Gautam, acting medical superintendent of the hospital, told the Post. “We can’t start taking in more patients in this poorly built hospital which is understaffed at the moment. Adding ICUs and ventilators is not going to prepare us to treat Covid-19 patients.” According to him, there are six medical officers and four nurses working at the hospital. According to Gautam, the provincial government had planned to upgrade the hospital to a 50-bed health institution two years ago but the plan is yet to come to fruition. “On Tuesday, Minister for Social Development Sudarshan Baral said he will decide on the hospital’s upgradation into a 50-bed hospital within a week,” he said.The 15-bed district hospital in Kapilvastu currently employs only six medical officers. “Among them, five have been appointed on a contract basis. The federal government’s decision to inject Rs 20 million into the hospital does not change anything. We are not prepared to handle Covid-19 patients immediately as envisioned by the federal government,” said Dr Kishor Banjade, acting medical superintendent of the hospital. “It is not possible to immediately purchase medical equipment and install them and also manage human resources to fill the vacant posts.” According to him, there are currently 25 vacant positions for medical officers in the hospital. Dr Binod Kumar Giri, provincial health director, said the federal government has been making decisions on distributing budget to district-based hospitals without coordinating with the provincial governments. “The federal government made the decision without a proper understanding of the ground realities,” he said. “There are no consultants, physicians, anaesthetists and other health workers to operate ventilators in the district hospitals.” According to him, the federal government did not consult with the provincial government before making the decision to provide a budget to Arghakhanchi and Kapilvastu district hospitals and a PCR machine to Palpa Hospital. The data of the Provincial Health Directorate shows that there are 19 government hospitals in Province 5. A total of 70 consultants, 156 medical officers and 149 staff nurses are working in these hospitals. But there are only four anaesthetists—medical professionals who are needed in ICUs. “ICU and ventilators cannot be operated without anaesthetists. We had given out a notice asking for anaesthetists but haven’t received any applications,” Giri said. “The government can use private hospitals as corona treatment centres rather than distributing budget to the district hospitals haphazardly,” said Devraj Pokharel, a social campaigner in Rupandehi. “Government hospitals with poor infrastructure and a lack of human resources cannot be upgraded immediately. It takes time to manage medical equipment and skilled workers. But Covid-19 patients need treatment immediately.” The provincial government in the current fiscal year has allocated Rs 1 billion budget for Covid-19 prevention and treatment. Dr Pushparaj Paudel, information officer at the Ministry of Social Development, said, “Out of 12 districts in the province, four hospitals in three districts have been developed as Covid-specific hospitals. But those hospitals are also reeling under a shortage of essential medical equipment and skilled human resources. There are only 33 ICUs, 33 monitors and 17 ventilators across these hospitals.” Minister for Social Development in Province 5 Sudarshan Baral said the need for Covid-19 specific hospitals is immediate in the province given the spread of the virus. “Covid-19 has started to affect senior citizens and the number of symptomatic patients has risen of late,” he said. “There are no ICUs and ventilator beds available in the province and there is a shortage of skilled health workers.” Kapilvastu is ranked the first in Province 5 in terms of total cases of Covid-19. Until Friday, 1,110 people tested positive for coronavirus in the district; four deaths have been reported so far. Meanwhile, in Arghakhanchi, one person had died and 379 individuals had tested positive for coronavirus as of Friday.","Published at : August 28, 2020",Rupandehi,Ghanashyam Gautam

Newly constructed hospital in Kapilvastu yet to come into operation,"Shivaraj Municipality had started the construction work of a hospital in mid-May, amid the Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown. The construction of the building has completed, but the hospital is yet to start its services, as it lacks human resources.“The physical infrastructure of the hospital is ready. We are facing problems running the hospital due to a lack of manpower,” said Sheshkanta Paudel, chief administrative officer of the municipality. According to him, the hospital, Basic Health Center, a few months ago had appointed two auxiliary health workers and auxiliary nurse midwives on a contract basis. “For the time being, we are going to deploy them to the hospital and start providing health services,” said Paudel. In May, an executive meeting of the municipality had decided to construct the hospital for coronavirus patients. Mahadev Pokharel, chairman of the consumer’s committee responsible for the construction work, said the hospital was built at the cost of Rs 7.2 million. “The municipality had provided Rs 6.5 million and locals donated the remaining 10 percent of the construction amount,” said Pokharel. The hospital building has six rooms that can accommodate six beds each, a store room, a room for health check ups and two other rooms for staff. “We constructed the hospital within three months to help the municipality fight against coronavirus. But the hospital has yet to start its services, as it does not have doctors and nurses, among other medical staff,” said Pokharel. However, the executive committee of the municipality has already endorsed the position of a medical doctor for the hospital.“The isolation centre, which is being operated at a resort in Kharendrapur, will be shifted to the hospital after the hospital comes into operation. The health facility will be developed into a municipal hospital after the coronavirus pandemic is over,” said Netraraj Adhikari, mayor at the municipality. Shivaraj Municipality is not the only local unit in the district that is ill-equipped to deal with the pandemic. The Kapilvastu District Hospital, the only hospital in the district headquarters of Taulihawa, has been sealed for the past two weeks, depriving many of health services. The hospital management decided to seal the hospital on August 10 after 25 of its health workers tested positive for Covid-19.Similarly, Bijayanagar Rural Municipality is also facing difficulties in managing its Covid-19 patients, mainly due to a shortage of skilled human resources. ""The risk of coronavirus transmission is increasing day by day. But we have not been able to effectively control the disease’s spread and provide treatment to the infected people due to the shortage of health workers,"" said Gopal Thapa, chairman of Bijayanagar Rural Municipality.Out of the posts for 30 health workers in Bijayanagar, 11 of auxiliary health workers and auxiliary nursing midwife are vacant now.In Krishnanagar Municipality, four posts of MBBS doctor and six posts of senior auxiliary health workers and auxiliary health workers are vacant in Shivaraj Hospital. Likewise, 26 posts of health workers in Maharajgunj, 13 in Shuddhodhan and eight in Shivaraj municipalities in the district are vacant now.Kapilvastu is ranked ninth across the nation and first in Province 5 in terms of total cases of Covid-19.

Local units in Rupandehi facing difficulties to set up isolation centre,"On August 15, the Covid-19 Crisis Management Centre of Tilottama Municipality, Rupandehi, decided to set up an additional isolation centre in view of the increasing number of coronavirus patients.However, the decision to set up the isolation centre at Puspalal Park in Banbatika has hit a snag after the park officials refused to vacate their newly constructed office building for the municipality to keep coronavirus patients. Tilottama Municipality has so far reported 32 Covid-19 cases. Twenty patients among them are being treated at Shankarnagar Health Post, two symptomatic patients are receiving treatment in Butwal Corona Hospital and the remaining patients are staying in home isolation. “The municipality has been witnessing a rise in the number of coronavirus cases in the last few weeks. There is currently only one isolation centre. We need to add at least one more,” said Moti Prasad Paudel, the health coordinator of the municipality.For the time being, the municipality has been using the building of the Shankarnagar Health Post as an isolation centre. “We have proposed the building of Puspalal Park as it is adjacent to the health post. It will be difficult for the municipality to run isolation centres in two different places,” said Basudev Ghimire, mayor of the municipality. “This is why we chose the park’s building since it’s close to the health post.” According to him, they can accommodate up to 20 patients in the park’s building. However, Ram Giri, coordinator of the Park Management Committee, said:“The construction work of the building has not been completed. The committee’s meeting of Wednesday has decided not to provide the building for an isolation centre. We are yet to fix electricity wires and bulbs in the hall room. And, the building cannot accommodate 20 individuals.” The locals also agree that the municipality needs another isolation centre. “The Park Management Committee should allow the authorities to use one of its buildings. The park’s building is in a suitable location near the health post,” said Bel Prasad Sharma, a resident of Tilottama-2. Meanwhile, Siddharthanagar Municipality Ward No. 2 is also facing resistance to set up an isolation centre at a local school.Dipak Kumar Thapa, ward chairman, said the local people in the ward are against the idea of setting up an isolation ward at Balbhahira School. The locals had even staged a protest against the municipality’s decision on Monday.“The school building can accommodate up to 100 individuals. But the locals aren’t happy with the decision to convert the school into an isolation centre,” Thapa said. Until Thursday, 5,288 Covid patients tested positive for coronavirus in Province 5.

People from remote districts stranded in Nepalgunj Airport for want of PCR test,"Lok Bahadur Shahi of Mugu, a remote district in Karnali Province, had come to Nepalgunj for his wife’s medical treatment last month. Shahi and his wife had flown to Nepaljung on a private airline and they have been stranded in the city ever since, as the government has banned airlines from flying passengers without their Polymerase Chain Reaction test reports.Regular flights to and from Nepalgunj Airport have been halted for the past four months. However, rescue flights are in operation for the districts that are not connected with a road network. ""We were supposed to return home on Friday. We had already boarded the flight but the airline officials asked us to deboard since we did not have our PCR test results,” said Shahi. “We have spent a lot of money on my wife’s treatment and our hotel stay here.” According to Shahi, there are around 30 people from Mugu, Humla and Jumla who are currently stranded in Nepalgunj.Nepalgunj Airport Office of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) has stopped issuing flight permits to airlines that do not implement the health and safety protocols set by the government. As per the protocols, a passenger should have a PCR test report, should use face masks at all times and the aircraft should manage sanitiser for all passengers. Although the authorities have made PCR test reports mandatory for passengers, there are no clear instructions on who should bear the expenses of the tests. ""The governments of the respective provinces are responsible for conducting the PCR tests of their air passengers. We only carry out the PCR tests of seriously ill people,"" said Naresh Shrestha, the focal person at the District Health Office in Banke. Meanwhile, the Social Development Ministry of Karnali Province has decided to bar the entry of individuals to the province without a PCR test report effective from August 17. But the ministry has not taken into account the people stranded at domestic airports.“The provincial government conducts the PCR tests of returnees who enter the province by road. The returnees are kept in quarantine centres where their PCR tests are conducted,” Dal Rawal, Social Development minister of Karnali Province, told the Post.

He and seven other people who came to Nepalgunj together from Bajura are waiting to return home, he said.The CAAN Nepalgunj Office on Friday cancelled the rescue flights of two private airlines that were scheduled to depart for the hill districts of Karnali and Sudurpaschim provinces, as they were not implementing the health security protocols.""The airlines had been operating rescue flights by following health security protocols. But of late, they have been found flouting the regulations despite our repeated requests,"" said Premnath Thakur, chief at the Nepalgunj Airport Office of the CAAN. ""It’s imperative for us to maintain health and safety protocols at all times,"" said Thakur. “That’s why we have had to cancel scheduled flights to Sudurpaschim and Karnali in the last few days.” According to Nepalgunj Airport, a total of 15 rescue flights were scheduled to fly to Dolpa, Humla, Mugu and Bajura districts on Sunday. “The cancellation has obviously put passengers in a fix but we can’t be negligent about health security at a time like this,” Thakur said. The airlines, meanwhile, expressed their dissatisfaction about the cancellations of the scheduled flights. ""Our flight, which was about to take off for Mugu, was cancelled at the eleventh hour on Friday. This has caused a lot of hassle for the passengers and for the airlines too,"" said Basanta Malla, the assistant station in-charge of Summit Airlines in Nepalgunj.(Kalendra Sejuwal contributed reporting from Surkhet) Frequently asked questions about the coronavirus outbreakUPDATED as of September 22, 2020What is Covid-19?Covid-19, short for coronavirus disease, is an illness caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, short for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Common symptoms of the disease include fever, dry cough, fatigue, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In severe cases, the infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. How contagious is Covid-19?Covid-19 can spread easily from person to person, especially in enclosed spaces. The virus can travel through the air in respiratory droplets produced when a sick person breathes, talks, coughs or sneezes. As the virus can also survive on plastic and steel surfaces for up to 72 hours and on cardboard for up to 24 hours, any contact with such surfaces can also spread the virus. Symptoms take between two to 14 days to appear, during which time the carrier is believed to be contagious.Where did the virus come from?The virus was first identified in Wuhan, China in late December. The coronavirus is a large family of viruses that is responsible for everything from the common cold to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). After an initial outbreak in Wuhan that spread across Hubei province, eventually infecting over 80,000 and killing more than 3,000, new infection rates in mainland China have dropped. However, the disease has since spread across the world at an alarming rate.   What is the current status of Covid-19?The World Health Organisation has called the ongoing outbreak a “pandemic” and urged countries across the world to take precautionary measures. Covid-19 has spread to 213 countries and territories around the world and infected more than 31,405,983 people with 967,505 deaths and 22,990,260 recoveries. In South Asia, India has reported the highest number of infections at 5,557,573 with 88,943 deaths. While Pakistan has reported 306,304 confirmed cases with 6,420 deaths. Nepal has so far reported 65,276 cases with 427 deaths.How dangerous is the disease?The mortality rate for Covid-19 is estimated to be 3.6 percent, but new studies have put the rate slightly higher at 5.7 percent. Although Covid-19 is not too dangerous to young healthy people, older individuals and those with immune-compromised systems are at greater risk of death. People with chronic medical conditions like heart disease, diabetes and lung disease, or those who’ve recently undergone serious medical procedures, are also at risk. How do I keep myself safe?The WHO advises that the most important thing you can do is wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizers with at least 60 percent alcohol content. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unclean hands. Clean and disinfect frequently used surfaces like your computers and phones. Avoid large crowds of people. Seek medical attention if symptoms persist for longer than a few days.Is it time to panic?No. The government has imposed a lockdown to limit the spread of the virus. There is no need to begin stockpiling food, cooking gas or hand sanitizers. However, it is always prudent to take sensible precautions like the ones identified above.","Published at : August 17, 2020",Nepalgunj,Rupa Gahatraj
Two dozen cases reported in Kapilvastu’s Taulihawa Bazaar on Friday,"A 49-year-old man from Taulihawa Bazaar in Kapilvastu has been undergoing treatment for Covid-19 at the corona special hospital in Butwal for the past week.On Thursday, his wife and daughter also tested positive for coronavirus. Since they are symptomatic patients, they were asked to get admitted to a hospital immediately. But the mother-daughter duo could not seek treatment at the District Hospital—the only government hospital in the area— as it was sealed from Monday following coronavirus infections among hospital staff. The duo then had to travel all the way to the corona special hospital in Butwal for treatment. The distance between Taulihawa and Butwal is around 52 km by road.The District Hospital on Monday closed its services after 25 health workers, including three doctors, tested positive for coronavirus. The infection has spread in Taulihawa Bazaar in the past week, and the locals have been left out in the cold since the hospital closed its services. “The closure of the hospital has not only affected coronavirus patients but also those of us who need medical attention for other ailments,” Pashupati Tripathi, a local of Taulihawa, told the Post. “We have no option but to go to Butwal for medical treatment and not everyone can afford to make the journey, especially at a time like this.” Taulihawa Bazaar in Kapilvastu Municipality was relatively untouched by the virus when infections started appearing in the district back in May. But on August 5, 17 individuals tested positive for coronavirus in the area. By Friday, the number had soared to 71, with 26 new cases reported on Friday alone.For the locals of the area, the spread of coronavirus and the closing down of the only government hospital have come as a rude awakening. “The number of coronavirus infections has been increasing every day. Most of the patients are those who were in regular contact with the public—they are bank employees and grocery store owners,” said Chakra Bahadur Chhetri, a resident of Taulihawa Bazaar. “What’s worse is that the only affordable hospital in the area has closed down its services so it’s difficult to check into a hospital if we get infected.” There are around half-a-dozen private hospitals and medical clinics in the area but not everybody can afford these private health institutions, says Chhetri. With the surge in cases, the locals have been demanding that the local authorities expand PCR testing in Taulihawa but the concerned authorities haven’t even been able to effectively contact trace possible coronavirus patients.The District Health Office in Kapilvastu says it hasn’t been able to expedite contact tracing in Taulihawa Bazaar because the office is facing a shortage of Viral Transport Medium sets.“We only have 50 VTM sets available now so we haven’t been able to expand contact tracing in Taulihawa,” said an official at the District Health Office, preferring anonymity. Until Friday, the total number of cases in Kapilvastu district had hit 923. Among them, 136 are active cases.","Published at : August 15, 2020",Kapilvastu,Manoj Paudel
Stray dogs terrorise Bhairahawa locals,"Stray dogs have been terrorising the locals of Bhairahawa in Rupandehi district with more than 200 cases of dog bite reported by a local hospital in the past one month alone.Locals say packs of violent dogs roam the streets and they have been routinely attacking humans.Officials at the Bhairahawa-based Bhim Hospital said 243 people were treated for dog bites in the last one month.“Seventy-three patients came seeking treatment for dog bites on August 2 alone,” said Gopal Upadhyay, an information officer at the hospital.The hospital records show that around 1,000 dog bite patients were treated in the last fiscal year.Locals have now started to blame the local municipal office for failing to curb the street mutts and allowing them to terrorise their neighbourhoods. ""My neighbours have been attacked by street dogs and have been hospitalised,” said Bijaya Gobinda Shrestha, a local of Bhairahawa. “The municipality has so far done nothing to control these animals.” Ishwor Chandra Chaudhary, chief at the veterinary unit of Siddharthanagar Municipality, said that the municipal office is aware of the street dog problem in Bhairahawa and its adjoining areas.""We have to control them through the sterilisation process. But the municipality does not have enough human resources or the necessary medical equipment,"" said Chaudhary. ""Just one sterilisation programme is not enough to curb the menace caused by stray dogs. All the concerned authorities must come together to start a campaign from the ground up.” Geeta Sharma, a local woman, is worried that the stray dogs in her locality are rabid.“It’s hard to step out of the house these days. We can’t walk or ride on two-wheelers without being chased by snarling dogs,"" she said. Although Siddharthanagar Municipality had allocated Rs 500,000 to run a street dog population control programme last fiscal year, the amount was never put to use. ""We had tried to sign an agreement with the Kathmandu-based Animal Nepal and Paklihawa Campus to run a sterilisation programme, but it couldn’t happen because of the Covid-19 pandemic,"" he said. The municipal office does not have any figure on the stray dog population. Chaudhary says their numbers could be more than 300. According to Dr Nabin Darnal, the medical superintendent of Bhim Hospital, a sudden spike in cases of street dogs turning vicious and attacking people means either they are infected with rabies or they are hungry. Dr Darnal himself is inclined towards the latter explanation. “These dogs could be acting out because they could be hungry. The lockdown has hit the dog population as well. Most of the eateries and shops that fed them are closed. These dogs are underfed and irritated,” he said.Bhairahawa does not have any animal welfare centres to look after and feed the street dogs.","Published at : August 14, 2020",Bhairahawa,Madhav Dhungana
Province 5 flounders in Covid-19 prevention and control efforts,"Province 5 was one of the hardest-hit provinces by the coronavirus pandemic back in April with districts like Kapilvastu, Dang, Palpa and Banke reporting the highest number of cases in the country closely followed by Province 2.In June Province 5 saw a substantial decrease in the number of cases and in July the nationwide lockdown was lifted in light of the slowing down of Covid-19 cases across the country. However, the past few weeks have seen an uptick in infection numbers in various parts of the country, including in Province 5, with some health experts warning of possible community transmissions in some places.The period between the last few days of the lockdown leading up to until a few days ago was seen as a “lull period” in terms of the coronavirus status of the country. This was also a missed opportunity for local governments to expedite and strengthen their efforts in containing the coronavirus spread. Civil society leaders in Kapilvastu point out the failure of the local governments to prepare themselves for the second wave of the pandemic which has been picking up pace in recent days. “The local and the provincial governments should have worked together to prepare for the second wave. They should have taken measures to control the spread during the lull period,” said Bhaktiram Panthi, chairman of the Abhibhak Samaj in Kapilvastu. ”They should have managed quarantine facilities and isolation centres instead of packing up and leaving. The virus has reached the communities now and it is imperative to expand the testing capacity of every local unit in the province.” The second wave has caught the authorities in Province 5 ill-prepared with no concrete plans and preparations to combat the spread at the community level. In Kapilvastu, which was among the districts with the highest number of Covid-19 cases, the local units have failed to manage isolation centres. A health worker of Krishnanagar Municipality Ward No 6, who tested positive for coronavirus on Tuesday, has been staying in his rented room alone. “The local unit has not managed an isolation centre here. I have been staying indoors since Tuesday and haven’t told my landlord about the infection,” he said. “If he finds out, he will not let me stay. I will have nowhere to go then.” Another employee of Krishnanagar Municipality, who also tested positive for Covid-19, has a similar story. “Nobody knows I am a Covid-19 patient. I am alone here but can’t tell anybody about my condition because the other people in the building will not let me stay here.” On Sunday, the municipality had collected 133 swab samples in Krishnanagar. Among them, 10 tested positive for coronavirus. Since the municipality has not managed an isolation centre in Krishnagar, all of the Covid patients are currently staying home. “All of the patients are in home isolation,” said Gehendra Bahadur Dangi, chief administrative officer of the municipality. “We haven’t decided if we will be constructing an isolation centre in the municipality or not.” Out of 10 local units in Kapilvastu, only Shivaraj and Badganga Municipalities have isolation centres. Most of the quarantine facilities and isolation centres in other local units have already been closed down. According to local units, individuals who were in those facilities went home after completing their quarantine or isolation periods. The local governments do not have a plan to stem the spread of coronavirus which has put all lives at risk, says Shambhu Upadhayay, former chairman of Civil Society in Nawalparasi (West). “The local governments do not have a long-term plan. Now the virus has reached the community level but the local units are still seeking help from provincial and federal governments,” he said. “This is where the local units have failed. They haven’t been able to even manage basic things like quarantine and isolation facilities.” There are a total of 4,150 isolation beds in 97 isolation centres including Covid-19 Special isolation hospitals in Province 5. Out of 4,150 beds, 270 beds are occupied. Govinda Khanal, the central vice chairman of the Human Rights and Peace Society, says the lack of initiatives from the local units, provincial and federal governments in tackling the pandemic highlights the inefficiency of governance at all levels. “The local units never have enough budget or the manpower to run isolation centres. This is where the provincial government should step in,” he said. “The last few weeks had presented a window for all tiers of government to work together to fight against Covid-19.” On Thursday, Provincial Health Directorate in Butwal organised a two-hour virtual meeting with local unit chiefs, chief district officers and health officials from high risk districts and discussed plans and preparations for the next phase. Dr Binod Giri, director at the Provincial Health Directorate, said, “It is necessary to stay alert and make preparations for the second wave of the coronavirus. In the meeting, we discussed how to manage isolation centres and adopt safety measures to fight against the virus.” However, people’s representatives, who attended the virtual meeting, said the outcome of the meeting was dismal and that the provincial directorate only managed to add more responsibility on the local units while letting the provincial government off the hook. Preferring anonymity, one of the people’s representatives from Kapilvastu, said: “Local units are not equipped to manage expenditure required for the fight against Covid-19. The lockdown has left the local economy in shambles and with the possibility of another lockdown looming large, recovery looks impossible.” The representative believes that by directing the local units to set up a local fund for Covid-19 expenditure, the provincial government is shirking its responsibility as a bigger and better equipped authority. Minister of Social Development Sudarshan Baral, meanwhile, says that none of the local units in the province have requested for funds to prevent and control the Covid-19 spread in the current fiscal year. “Currently, we have a total of Rs 170 million in the Covid-19 Prevention and Control Fund. If the local units demand a budget, we can mobilise the fund. Additionally, we can also seek help from the federal government if needed,” he said. According to the Ministry of Social Development, community level testing of swab samples started in the province from last week. “Until now, 1,528 swab samples have been collected from six districts of the province. Out of 858 results, 18 have come positive so far,” said Baral. The data of the Ministry of Social Development showed that 4,382 individuals tested positive for coronavirus in Province 5 until Thursday. Among them, 13 died, 4,099 have been discharged and 270 are still undergoing treatment.

Multiple landslides obstruct several sections of Siddhartha Highway,"Multiple landslides triggered by incessant monsoon rain have obstructed traffic on various parts of the Siddhartha Highway that connects Bhairahawa to Pokhara.Some of the road sections blocked by landslide debris had also suffered the same fate last year. Authorities had built walls to prevent a repeat the next year, but that doesn’t seem to have worked, locals said.On Sunday night, around three meters of road caved in at Dhovan near Naag Mandir area in Ward No 3 of Tinau Rural Municipality. Vehicular movement on the road was obstructed for 10 hours due to the damage. A diversion was constructed after clearing debris from the landslide. Som Bahadur Saru, of Dhovan police post, said, “It was possible to construct a diversion within a short time as the road was wide enough,” he added. One-way traffic resumed on the road section later in the day. “Although one-way traffic resumed, it’s still risky to drive heavy vehicles on the road as the area is prone to landslides,” said Saru.The Dovan area had also witnessed a landslide, two years ago. This time, a large boulder lodged itself into a hill around 100 meters above the road. Authorities are worried that the boulder may roll down and block or damage the road. Two years ago, the Division Road Office, Palpa, had constructed a retaining wall worth more than Rs 10 million to prevent landslides on the road section. However, this year’s rain swept the wall away . Bikram Bhusal, assistant traffic sub-inspector deployed on the road section, said, “The Siddhababa area is still prone to landslides. We advise drivers to remain on the lookout for rocks and boulders.” Likewise, a road section of the highway near the Ramapithecus Park was also obstructed by a landslide on Monday. “There’s one-way vehicular movement in the area now. Two years ago, the Division Road Office in Palpa, had invested Rs 50 million to control landslides in the area,” said Bhusal. “We have been deployed to clear the road. Two excavators are working to clear landslide debris from the damaged road sections.” Similarly, three years ago, the road section in Bhutkhola suffered damages due to a landslide. The road section is still in need of repairs. On Monday, a massive landslide occurred near the permanent bridge joining Bhutkhola and Dovan bazaar. Krishna Prasad Pandey, a local resident of Jhumsa, said, “One-way traffic has been allowed on the road joining Bhutkhola and Jhumsa due to multiple landslides on the road. “The Division Road Office has already been informed about the situation. Officials should immediately take the initiative to prevent landslides and casualties.” According to ward chair Prem Pandeya, 31 houses in Pani Mill area are currently at risk of being swept away by a landslide. “Around 60 metres of the road near Chaubis Mile has been damaged now. A permanent bridge along the highway is also at risk of collapsing,” said Pandeya. Suraj Karki, an ambulance driver based in Gulmi said, “There’s always traffic jams on this road section during the rainy season. The state of the road has worsened over the years.” , Karki remains stranded on the road. Meanwhile, Shibu Khatri, information officer at Division Road Office, Palpa, informed, “We will have to start repair works now. We will construct retaining walls and build necessary infrastructure after conducting a survey of the area,” he said.","Published at : July 27, 2020",Palpa,Madhab Aryal

Police in Bardiya crack down on farmers importing fertilisers from India,"For months, farmers in Banke and Bardiya have been struggling to get hold of chemical fertilisers, especially Urea, as paddy plantation season got underway. So when they started bringing in fertilisers from the bordering town of Balaigaun in India, they were relieved. But their relief was short-lived, as the Area Police Office in Motipur has started confiscating the imported fertilisers.Farmers, on the other hand, are troubled further, as many of them had taken loans to purchase the fertilisers.The farmers had resorted to the Indian town after the Nepal Government couldn’t supply them with fertilisers. For a few days, the local administrations had turned a blind eye. But now, farmers say that Nepali police has started cracking down on them.Superintendent Kedar Rajaure of Bardiya Police said that for a few days, his office had allowed the import of fertilisers from India on local representatives’ requests. Rajaure claimed that they had begun cracking down on the farmers after the fertilisers were peddled to other districts, including Banke.“The ban on the import of fertilisers was lifted for a few days, as farmers were reeling under a crisis of fertilisers, but it is not allowed to transport it to other districts,” Rajaure said.On Friday, fertilisers carried by more than a dozen farmers were confiscated and handed over to the customs office.The Indian government has subsidised fertilisers for its farmers and has restricted its export, but the Nepal police had coordinated the import for a few days.The farmers have been purchasing the fertilisers at a price ranging from Rs1,000 to Rs1,500 per sack of Urea.Ward Chair of Badhaiyatal Rural Municipality-7 Indra Luitel said that his office had temporarily opened the Mahammadpur border for farmers purchasing fertilisers.“We were compelled to ban the import of fertilisers after we found the fertilisers were sold at high price back in other districts of Nepal,” Luitel said. The border has been closed back from Friday night.Mohan Singh KC, chief of Agriculture Inputs Company Limited, Bardiya, said that while farmers are reeling under the crisis, there’s no certainty when the government would make the fertilisers available. “This is a crucial period for paddy farming,” he said. “A shortage of fertilisers would have a long-lasting impact on the produce this year.”","Published at : July 19, 2020",Bardiya,Thakur Singh Tharu

Six stranded Nepali women rescued from Delhi,"Six Nepali women who were taken to Delhi on the pretext of sending them to Iraq and Qatar for foreign employment were rescued and brought to the Krishnanagar border point in Kapilvastu on Friday. The victims, aged 26 to 41, had been stranded in the Indian Capital for the past three months.According to the rescued women, the local agents of their respective district took them to Delhi with the promise of lucrative jobs in Iraq and Qatar. “They told us they would send us abroad for free,” one of the six women told the Post.Among the six women brought to the country on Friday, four are from Morang district and one each from Jhapa and Parbat. According to them, the local agents took them to Kathmandu in the third week of February where they met with the main agent and acquired their passports. “The agent in Kathmandu convinced us that we should not miss an opportunity of getting a good job in Iraq and Qatar,” said another rescued woman. The trafficked women handed over their passports to the agent soon after they acquired them. They were first taken to Butwal through Pokhara, kept at a hotel in Dang for a night and brought to Nepalgunj, where they stayed for two more nights before entering India through the Jamunaha-Rupaidiha border in Banke. They reached Delhi on March 13.According to the women, they were locked inside a house in Jharoda, Delhi, soon after reaching the city. “The agents went out of contact after the Indian government enforced lockdown in the third week of March. Their cell phones were switched off. We got help from the local people, who provided us with food. We telephoned relatives and asked them to rescue us,” said one of the trafficked women.Their relatives contacted the police and the Ministry of Home Affairs, urging them to rescue the stranded.

"Two people killed, three missing in Gulmi landslide","Two people died and three others are missing in a landslide that occurred in Gulmi on Thursday night.The two deceased are a 16-month-old toddler and an eight-year-old girl. Dozens of cattle were also killed in the incident that took place at around 11pm at Hastichaur in Ishma Rural Municipality-1 of the district. Three persons were rescued from the debris via a helicopter on Friday evening, more than 18 hours after the disaster. Among the three, one is in a critical condition, according to doctors. All three are receiving treatment at a Kathmandu-based hospital.Another injured person was transported to Kathmandu for further treatment on Friday evening, according to DSP Kedarnath Panta of Gulmi Police.Former minister and a member of parliament Gokarna Bista arrived in Gulmi with a helicopter for rescue efforts. Tarpaulins and relief materials have been provided to the affected families.Ward Chair Chura Bahadur Khatri said that rescue efforts were made difficult because of roads blocked by the landslide and bad weather. “The ones trapped beneath the debris were rescued but we couldn’t immediately take them to the hospital because the roads were blocked,” he said. “Helicopter rescue was the only option, but that, too, faced obstacles due to bad weather.”As many as 24 families have been displaced by the landslide in Musikot Municipality, according to Mayor Somnath Sapkota. Landslides have also occurred in nine other places of Maldi Village, a settlement of 116 households. Ten families were displaced by Thursday’s landslide and the whole village is at risk of being swept away by the disaster. Similarly, fourteen households in Musikot Village have also been displaced by Thursday’s landslide. The district saw over two dozen landslides on Thursday night alone, according to Prakash Kafle, spokesperson of Musikot Municipality.Locals speculate that the landslide occurred when a still water dam along a recently repaired road in Hastichaur burst open because of continuous rainfall and thunderstorm, according to ward chair KhatriThe landslide has also damaged the building of Kalika Lower Secondary School, which was being remodeled as a quarantine facility in the wake of Covid-19 crisis. After the landslide, five quarantined individuals have been sent home to self-quarantine, according to Gun Prasad Adhikari, ward chair of Isma Rural Municipality-4.","Published at : July 3, 2020",Rupandehi,Ghanshyam Gautam
Local units in Province 5 have mandated home quarantine for returnees but without any regulation,"A week ago, five individuals returned from India to their home at Purnihawa in Yashodhara Rural Municipality-5, Kapilvastu, but instead of being placed at a quarantine facility, as is the norm for returnees, they were sent straight to their families by Ward Chief Shyam Narayan Upadhyay. All four quarantine facilities in the ward had already been closed down, according to Upadhyay. The returnees are now living with their families and are moving around the village without any restriction, according to locals, raising the risk of a coronavirus outbreak in the community.“I had informed the rural municipality chief about the returnees but since all the quarantine facilities were closed, they were sent home to self-quarantine,” said Upadhyay. All 29 quarantine centres in the rural municipality are now being emptied out.Once home, hardly anyone adopts preventive guidelines for Covid-19. “This has spread fear among the villagers but officials have not paid heed to our concern,” said Deependra Nath Shukla, a local of Sadwa in Kapilvastu-3.Quarantine facilities in a majority of Kapilvastu’s local units, including Mayadevi, Yashodhara and Suddhodhan, are now closed since most returnees have completed the stipulated 14-day quarantine period and have been sent home to self-isolate.The local units have no record of how many people have returned and are currently staying in home quarantine. “The policy is that all the returnees should be staying in quarantine facilities for at least 14 days,” Yogendra Bhagat, chief of the District Health Office, said. “There’s no policy as such that says returnees can quarantine at home.” Kapilvastu has a total of 745 Covid-19 cases, the third highest in the country.Like in Kapilvastu, quarantine centres in other districts of Province 5 have also begun to shut down. In Dang, many have fled quarantine centres as the test results have taken too long to arrive. And not all who are staying in quarantines are being tested. “We have asked those who have completed 14 days in quarantine to stay in home isolation for seven more days,” Sunita Poudel, chief of the District Health Office, Dang, said. But even though the office has mandated home isolation, there’s no such body regulating it.This has led to a rise in the risk of a coronavirus outbreak, further exacerbated by the fact that even those who are not returnees have been infected, said Narayan Gharti, chief of health department at Ghorahi Sub Metropolitan City. While at one point, the district had over 11,000 people in quarantines, the number has slumped to just about 3,000 now, according to Gharti. As of Monday, the district has registered 590 Covid-19 cases.Meanwhile in Palpa, health workers are having a hard time regulating quarantine and isolation centres, and nobody is paying attention to those quarantining at home. The district has recorded 498 cases so far. Rem Bahadur Magar, chief of health department at Nisdi Rural Municipality, said that as coronavirus cases have seen a surge, health workers are scrambling to monitor quarantine and isolation centres. “There’s not enough staff to regulate the quarantine and isolation centres,” Magar said. “In the current situation, paying attention to those who are self-isolating at home after completing their quarantine time would be a far cry.”Sudarshan Thapa, the focal person at the Butwal-based Corona-specific hospital, said that making returnees stay in home quarantine would not be a good idea, as many houses in villages do not have separate toilets and many can’t even afford a separate room as stipulated by the guideline issued by WHO for home quarantine.“Many local units are sending returnees straight to home quarantine without any regulation, which will only lead to a rapid community transfer of the virus,” he said.(Manoj Paudel in Kapilvastu, Durgalal KC in Dang, Madhab Aryal in Palpa and Sanju Paudel in Rupandehi contributed reporting.) Frequently asked questions about the coronavirus outbreakUPDATED as of September 22, 2020What is Covid-19?Covid-19, short for coronavirus disease, is an illness caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, short for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Common symptoms of the disease include fever, dry cough, fatigue, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In severe cases, the infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. How contagious is Covid-19?Covid-19 can spread easily from person to person, especially in enclosed spaces. The virus can travel through the air in respiratory droplets produced when a sick person breathes, talks, coughs or sneezes. As the virus can also survive on plastic and steel surfaces for up to 72 hours and on cardboard for up to 24 hours, any contact with such surfaces can also spread the virus. Symptoms take between two to 14 days to appear, during which time the carrier is believed to be contagious.Where did the virus come from?The virus was first identified in Wuhan, China in late December. The coronavirus is a large family of viruses that is responsible for everything from the common cold to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). After an initial outbreak in Wuhan that spread across Hubei province, eventually infecting over 80,000 and killing more than 3,000, new infection rates in mainland China have dropped. However, the disease has since spread across the world at an alarming rate.   What is the current status of Covid-19?The World Health Organisation has called the ongoing outbreak a “pandemic” and urged countries across the world to take precautionary measures. Covid-19 has spread to 213 countries and territories around the world and infected more than 31,405,983 people with 967,505 deaths and 22,990,260 recoveries. In South Asia, India has reported the highest number of infections at 5,557,573 with 88,943 deaths. While Pakistan has reported 306,304 confirmed cases with 6,420 deaths. Nepal has so far reported 65,276 cases with 427 deaths.How dangerous is the disease?The mortality rate for Covid-19 is estimated to be 3.6 percent, but new studies have put the rate slightly higher at 5.7 percent. Although Covid-19 is not too dangerous to young healthy people, older individuals and those with immune-compromised systems are at greater risk of death. People with chronic medical conditions like heart disease, diabetes and lung disease, or those who’ve recently undergone serious medical procedures, are also at risk. How do I keep myself safe?The WHO advises that the most important thing you can do is wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizers with at least 60 percent alcohol content. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unclean hands. Clean and disinfect frequently used surfaces like your computers and phones. Avoid large crowds of people. Seek medical attention if symptoms persist for longer than a few days.Is it time to panic?No. The government has imposed a lockdown to limit the spread of the virus. There is no need to begin stockpiling food, cooking gas or hand sanitizers. However, it is always prudent to take sensible precautions like the ones identified above.","Published at : June 30, 2020",Butwal,Province 5 Bureau
Rupandehi District Court remands in custody three people arrested in connection with murder of Dalit teen,"The Rupandehi District Court has remanded in custody three people allegedly involved in the murder of a 13-year-old Dalit girl a month ago.The single bench of Judge Krishna Prasad Paudel on Thursday issued the order to remand in custody the prime accused Birendra Bhar, his mother Akali Devi and aunt Shitali over the murder of Angira Pasi from Devdaha Municipality-11. The court issued the order following preliminary hearings in the case. According to Ganga Adhikari, an information officer at the court, 19 advocates argued on behalf of the victim and the defendants.Pasi was found hanging from a tree on May 23 near her home. The accused, Birendra Bhar, a neighbour from a so-called upper caste family, had allegedly raped the teenager the previous night. A village assembly, which included local people’s representatives, decided to resolve the incident by marrying off Pasi with Bhar.Bhar’s mother and aunt had publicly said that they would not accept Pasi as their daughter-in-law, and did not let her enter the house as she was a Dalit. Police had initially refused to register a murder case against the suspects. Following pressure from the locals and Dalit rights activists, police finally registered the case three days after the incident and arrested the accused for investigaton. Police had registered a charge sheet against the trio on June 21 and presented the suspects before the court on Tuesday.","Published at : June 25, 2020",Tilottama,Sanju Paudel
Landslides and floods threaten many settlements in mid-hill region,"Several landslides have occurred along the Siddhartha Highway, Tansen-Ridi road and other rural roads in Palpa, Arghakhanchi and Gulmi districts since the monsoon arrived in Nepal earlier this month.In Palpa, a landslide at Bandipokhara of Tansen swept away four vehicles killing four people on Monday while the search is ongoing for the missing. Around a dozen landslides have occurred along the Tansen-Ridi road section since the second week of June. More than a dozen landslides have also occurred along the Harthok-Arghakhanchi road section while electricity has been cut off in various parts of Ribdikot, Rainadevi Chhahara and Tinau for the last three days after landslides damaged the power lines.In Arghakhanchi, the Gorusinghe-Sandhikharka road section that leads to the district headquarters has been obstructed for the last five days. Officials say continuous rainfall has hindered the efforts to resume the traffic along the road. Similarly, a landslide triggered by the monsoon downpour killed two people when a moving vehicle was buried at Hadhade area in Dhurkot of Gulmi district four days ago. At least 22 families in Ishma and Resunga villages in the district were also displaced after landslides struck their settlements. The district administration office said around a dozen houses in Satyawati and Musikot villages were at high risk of landslides.Over the years, excessive use of heavy equipment to construct roads and other infrastructure in the mid-hill regions has raised the risk of natural disasters such as floods, landslides and soil erosion. Binod Ghimire, a local resident of Tansen Municipality-5, said, “Road expansions in the villages are happening at a rapid pace and the local authorities have not been considering the environmental impact while starting infrastructure development works in fragile topography.” Bishnu Prasad Shrestha, an engineer based in Palpa, said, “Rural roads are carved out on slopes without considering the topography. This has increased the risk of landslides in hilly areas. In rural areas, dozer drivers are given the responsibility of an engineer and they possess no technical expertise or knowledge about constructing roads on hilly sections.” Ram Prasad Shrestha, an engineer in Palpa, said, “The local unit should think about the environmental impact before digging roads. All rural roads were dug up without technical assessment, which has raised the risk of floods and erosions during monsoon.” According to Durga Banjade, assistant chief district officer, Hungi of Rambha, Shreedanda, Koldanda, Masyam and Dhovan of Tinau, Gejha of Rampur, Bikot of Purba Khola, Khasyeuli of Robdikot, Salahakot and Jyamire of Nisdi and Besi area of Kaligandaki are at high risk of landslides. “There’s landslide risks at Tansen-Harthok, Harthok Chhahara, Siddhartha Highway, Aryabhanjyang-Rampur and Kaligandaki corridor as well. These roads are at risk of landslides because of road expansion.” said Banjade. More than 200 families are at risk of landslides in Palpa alone. The local units are supposed to allocate funds for disaster risk management, but most local authorities have said that they lack the budget. Ram Bahadur Karki, chairman of Rainadevi Chhahara Rural Municipality, said they have allocated a limited budget for disaster management in the current fiscal year because of financial constraints. Meanwhile, Narayan Bahadur GC, chairman of Ribdikot Rural Municipality, believes that the funds from the local government alone will not be enough to mitigate and manage natural disasters. “All three tiers of governments should coordinate to mitigate disasters in rural areas,” he said. The Disaster Risk and Management Act 2017 states that federal, provincial and local units should be mobilised in an integrated way to minimise and manage disasters. Currently, all government bodies are focused on combating coronavirus, said Bijayaraj Paudel, chief district officer in Arghakhanchi. “We could not focus towards limiting the risk of disaster this monsoon due to the coronavirus pandemic,” he said. According to the District Administration Office in Arghakhanchi, Sandhikharka, Shitaganga, Malarani, Bhumikasthan, Chhatradev, and Padini areas are at high risk of floods and landslides.","Published at : June 25, 2020",Palpa,Madhab Aryal
"After Covid-19, Narainapur locals have another fear to grapple with: flood","At about 2pm on Tuesday, Najiya Nuri is hard at work in her kitchen as dense clouds swirl overhead. She has to be quick to prepare lunch for if it rains, the roof will leak and kill the fire in the mud oven. If the rain continues for hours, the currents of the Rapti River will enter her house at Bhagwanpur in Narainapur Rural Municipality. On Saturday, it did after an incessant rain that lasted for hours.“We have to eat our meals well before it rains regardless of whether it’s properly cooked or not,” Najiya, who is 16, said. She starts cooking after observing the movement of the clouds, she added.In mid-May, Narainapur made national headlines as the village turned into a hotspot of the Covid-19 crisis in the country where one person died and dozens from a single quarantine facility were diagnosed with the virus. The situation worsened as the village didn’t have a hospital with even the most basic facilities and locals protested against taking their infected relatives elsewhere. By the first week of June, the situation was more or less under control, as the infected individuals were transferred to isolation facilities in Nepalgunj and Kohalpur.But a month after the crisis, the woes of Narainapur locals are far from over. While they are reeling under one crisis, there’s another looming: the perennial flood. These days the villagers plan their day around the movement of the rain clouds so as to make a quick escape in case of a flood. On Saturday, when the rain entered their home, Najiya’s family of nine stayed awake all night fearing a possible flood. This is what they have been doing every rainy season. Earlier, the locals had come together to create an embankment to prevent the river from running off its course, but the makeshift barrier hasn’t stopped the mighty currents. To prevent possible floods from entering the settlements, Narainapur needs an embankment of at least 200 metres, but the existing one is only 25 metres long, locals say. As a result, the river has reached the homes of almost everyone in ward number 6.According to Birendra Pal, chair of ward no. 6, Gangapur, Jamuni, Kohala, Lakshmanpur and Rampur Joljala are the villages that are at high risk of getting inundated by floods in the Rapti River. Over 1,600 families will be directly affected by floods in the river, Pal said. The flood of 2016 had permanently displaced as many as 200 families in the local unit.“Despite the perennial damage that the flood causes, there are no places for the locals to take shelter in,” Pal said. After thousands of acres of arable land and scores of houses were deluged in the 2016 floods, many youths were compelled to migrate to India for work. Many have returned following the coronavirus crisis but they don’t have any land to generate income from, Pal said.The risk of a flood in Narainapur is high and there are signs that the flood may turn violent this year, said Gauri Budhathoki, information officer at the District Emergency Work Operation Centre. On Saturday, police rescued 11 people from the Rapti River. The river’s surface had risen to 5m 90cm from its usual level of 2m 30cm due to incessant rainfall in the past few days, according to Budhathoki. The river reaches ‘danger level’ when it rises to 5m 40cm high, Budhathoki said. In 2015, the water level had reached more than 8m 75cm. The rural municipality, however, is hardly prepared to mitigate the damage caused by floods. Istihak Ahmed Shah, chair of the rural municipality, said that the construction of a shelter with support from the Ministry of Urban Development remains incomplete in Narainapur after the contractor abandoned the project and disappeared. “If a flood hits, we would have to turn the schools into shelters,” he said.Meanwhile, Najiya said her family has no hope of coming through the flood unscathed. “If the flood enters our house, it will inundate the floor, oven, bed, everything,” she said. “The only recourse is to climb up on the rooftop, and wait for the flood to recede.”","Published at : June 25, 2020",Narainapur,Madhu Shahi						 &
Fourth body recovered from landslide debris in Palpa,"Authorities, who have recovered three bodies from under the debris of a landslide that took place in Palpa on Monday, have exhumed the body of yet another individual on Tuesday.The body of the deceased, an 18-year-old from Jhapa, was recovered on Tuesday from the debris of the landslide that took place at Sammobari, Tansen Municipality Ward No. 11 on Monday.  “Security personnel from the Nepali Army, Nepal Police and Armed Police Force were looking for bodies at the incident site from Monday,” said Deputy Superintendent Madan Giri. The landslide had swept away four vehicles— a tanker, a jeep, a mini truck and a car— on the Tansen-Ridi road section in Palpa, around 6km from the district headquarters, on Monday. “Two bodies were recovered from the incident site while a third person, who was rescued alive, died while receiving treatment at United Mission Hospital,” said Giri. According to him, all of the deceased were workers at a construction company in Gulmi. The number of passengers inside the vehicles that were swept away is unknown, said Giri.A high-tension electricity line was also buried in the debris, preventing the use of excavators to clear the debris, Giri added.The landslide, which took place on the road that was widened just a month ago, has put at least a dozen houses in Bandipokhara of Tansen Municipality at risk. Landslides have also been reported at Aryabhanjyang, Chapgaira in Rampur, Sefad, and Khaliwan, among other places in the district.","Published at : June 23, 2020",Palpa,Madhab Aryal
"Landslide buries four vehicles in Palpa, three killed","A landslide swept away four vehicles at Sammobari along the Tansen-Ridi road section in Palpa district on Monday. At least two bodies have been recovered from the incident site while one person, who was found seriously injured in the incident site, died while undergoing treatment at Mission Hospital, said police. Madan Giri, Deputy Superintendent of Police in Palpa, verified that three persons died in the landslide. “All three bodies are in Palpa Hospital. But, we are yet to identify the bodies,” said Giri. The landslide occurred six kilometres from the district headquarters Tansen and buried a tanker, a jeep, a mini truck and a car. The number of passengers in the vehicles swept by the landslide is unconfirmed.A rescue team comprising personnel from Nepal Army, Armed Police Force and Nepal Police has been clearing the debris.Multiple landslides triggered by incessant rainfall in the past three days have also blocked the Palpa-Gulmi road section since Monday morning. Hundreds of vehicles and passengers have been stranded.Bishnu Bhusal, one of the stranded passengers, said a dozen landslides have occurred along the stretch, including at Dhungakhani, Sammobari and Jogepani.Giri said continuous rainfall has hampered rescue efforts. Police said a high-tension electricity wire buried in the landslide has also prevented the use of excavators to clear the debris.Landslide on a road widened a month ago has put a dozen houses at risk in Bandipokhara of Tansen Municipality. Security personnel have moved the residents to a safer location. Multiple landslides have been reported at Aryabhanjyang, Chapgaira in Rampur, Sefad, and Khaliwan, among other places in the district.A one-way traffic has resumed on the Siddhartha Highway following landslides in Siddhababa, Gaudepul and Burtung, according to police.

Individuals at quarantine facilities in Banke living with fear of snakes,"Last week, Sundarlal Kadu was bit by a snake while he was sleeping at a quarantine facility in Janaki Rural Municipality, Banke.Kadu spent the entire night in agony and without treatment since the ward office could not manage an ambulance at night. Mohammad Raja Rai, the ward chairman, said he tried to get an ambulance to take Kadu to a hospital but none was available. “I made several phone calls but there was no ambulance available to take the patient to a hospital,” he said. It was only at 8am the next morning that Kadu was admitted to Bheri Hospital. He is now out of danger, said Rai. Snake sightings in the rural municipality are not uncommon but this year, the locals are more exposed to the threat of snake bites since most of them are housed at poorly managed quarantine facilities. According to Rai, ever since he was quarantined, he has on several occasions seen snakes inside the facility but never had the means to protect himself. “There are no beds in the facility and no ambulance in the isolation centre. The snakes slither into the facility at night and we don’t know how to stop them,” he said.The ward office on June 9 had agreed to send 19 quarantined individuals to their homes after they refused to stay in the facility for fear of snakes. Currently, there are 14 individuals at the facility. The situation is the same in quarantine centres across Narainapur, the hotspot of coronavirus spread in Province 5. There are currently 130 individuals staying at three quarantine facilities in Narainapur. All three facilities are dimly lit and do not have enough beds, which make it difficult for the quarantined to avoid snakes. “We can’t sleep at night for fear of getting bitten. It’s also hot indoors so we spend our nights outside but that leaves us exposed to snakes,” said Jahid Ali Sekh, who’s staying at a quarantine facility in Ward No.4. Sekh had returned home from Maharashtra in India almost two weeks ago. Istiyak Ahamad Shah, chairman at the rural municipality, admitted that his office does not have the funds to properly manage quarantine facilities in the local unit.“We don’t have the funds to purchase beds or secure the facilities from snakes,” he said.In Bardiya, people staying in quarantine facilities face the same reality. Last week, a man was bitten by a snake at Sadashiva Multiple Campus quarantine in Barbardiya Municipality. A few weeks prior to that incident, locals in Gulariya also reported spotting snakes inside the quarantine facility at Bagalamukhi Radhakrishna Tharu Secondary School. The data of Bheri Hospital showed that eight out of 150 snakebite victims died while undergoing treatment in the last fiscal year. “The hot and humid weather brings snakes out of their shelters, which makes their confrontation with humans unavoidable. The only way to save oneself from snake bites is by using beds and mosquito nets,” Dr Paras Pandey, a snakebite specialist in Banke, said. According to him, kraits and cobras are the most commonly found snake species in Banke and Bardiya. Meanwhile, some individuals staying at a quarantine facility in Banke’s Khajura Rural Municipality have brought their own beds and mosquito nets from home to protect themselves from snakes. But for others, taking such measures is not possible.“I get covered with mosquitoes and other insects while sleeping at night, and I worry that I might get bitten by snakes. But I can’t afford a bed or a mosquito net,” said Budhisara Magar, a resident of Simalghari staying at a quarantine facility in the local unit. There are 88 individuals, including seven women, in the quarantine facility set up at Janakalyan Secondary School of Khajura. “We have asked newcomers to sleep outdoors since all rooms are packed. We have also asked them to bring their own beds and mosquito nets, as we have run out of resources to make such arrangements for them,” said Eka Maya BK, vice chairperson at the rural municipality. There are currently 279 individuals staying at 24 quarantine facilities in Khajura Rural Municipality.","Published at : June 19, 2020",Banke,Madhu Shahi						 &
Discharged Covid-19 infected individuals return to their villages only to be shunned,"Dinesh Dhobi, a daily wage worker in Mumbai, India, lost his job amid the Covid-19 pandemic and had to return home recently. Upon his return to the country, he tested positive for the virus and was placed in an isolation ward in Kohalpur. However, in the two weeks that he spent at the ward, he did not show any symptoms of the disease, so authorities sent him home.But despite being in his hometown of Mataiya in Narainapur Rural Municipality, Dhobi has yet to enter his house. He sleeps on his house’s rooftop at night and spends the whole day by the Rapti riverside. His family and villagers avoid any contact with him, scared that they might catch the virus.“I spent two months in Mumbai without any work and had to return home empty-handed. I borrowed Rs 5,000 from a friend and reached the no-man’s land in Narainapur,” said Dhobi. “I don’t have any source of income left. My family is running short of food and are scared that I might spread the virus. So I choose to spend the time by myself and keep my distance from everyone.” A week ago, the federal government had implemented a directive to send coronavirus infected individuals to their homes if they don’t show any symptoms of the disease after spending two weeks in isolation. Dhobi is among the 22 asymptomatic Covid-19-infected individuals who were sent home from the isolation centres in Kohalpur and Corona Special Hospital in Dang on June 8.They were advised by the doctors at the hospital and the isolation centre to stay in self-isolation at home for 10 days. Another returnee from India, Omkar Yadav of the same village, is also struggling to survive with no income and no support from the villagers. He can’t even afford to buy a surgical face mask and uses a piece of cloth to cover his nose and mouth, he says. “The villagers scolded me for not wearing a mask so I started covering my mouth with a piece of cloth. This is cultivation season and there is plenty of work in the village but the villagers don’t want me working for them,” he said. “My neighbours don’t talk to me anymore; they are scared that I might infect them with the virus.” The situation is the same for Ramjan Behan, a resident of Mataiya, who returned to his home from an isolation centre in Dang five days ago. “I have run out of money to buy salt and cooking oil. I have food grains in store which I want to sell or exchange for some salt but none of the villagers wants to trade with us,” he said. “They are afraid of me and my family now. They won’t even employ me in their fields.” A majority of Mataiya locals go to India to work as daily wage workers and most of them have returned home because of the pandemic and the subsequent lockdown. “On one hand, the youths who were providing for their families have lost their source of income and are in need of jobs,” said Yubaraj Maurya, the ward chairman in Narainapur Rural Municipality-5. “On the other hand, the entire village is now worried about a possible outbreak of the disease and are afraid to employ the returnees. The authorities decided to send the infected to their villages without thinking of the repercussions it would have on the villagers and the returnees.” The rural municipality has arranged for mosquito nets, bed sheets, masks and other sanitary materials for the coronavirus-infected people to use at home while in self-isolation. “But the quantity is not enough. The family members of the infected frequent the ward office either demanding work or relief materials. But the number of returnees is increasing by the day and we don’t have the resources to look after all of them,” said Maurya. It hasn’t been easy to return home and live with the fear of being excluded from society, said Parameshwar Godiya, a recent returnee to Mataiya.“I spent several weeks in quarantine facilities and isolation centres after I tested positive for the virus. Now that I have returned to the village, I don’t know how long it will take for the villagers to stop branding me as a coronavirus patient. I wish we had one more test done just to rule out the disease but they sent us home without doing a second test,” Godiya said. Sarbir Khan of the same village, who returned home after full recovery a few days ago, already feels cut off by the villagers. “Even my neighbours don’t treat me the same as before,” he said. “I have nothing left to eat at home but no one has come forward to help us in these difficult times. There’s no employment or support.” Chairman of the rural municipality Istiyak Ahamad Shah says the local unit does not have the funds to provide any relief to the returnees. So far, 118 people have been infected with coronavirus in Narainapur. Among them, one died and others were discharged from isolation centres and sent home.The situation is similar in Yashodhara Rural Municipality of Kapilvastu. Seven Covid-19-infected individuals, who recently returned to their villages, also talk about being ostracised by the villagers. “My neighbours don’t talk to me; they turn away if they see me coming,” he said. “I feel so unwelcome in my own village,” said a 28-year-old Covid-19-infected man in Banskhor. In some cases, despite having fully recovered from the virus, some returnees say they continue to get shunned by villagers and relatives. “I contracted Covid-19 while I was in Mumbai and now I have recovered. But my relatives and neighbours still don’t want to engage with me,” said a 46-year-old man from the same rural municipality.Girajesh Pandey, chairman at Yashodhara Rural Municipality, admits that infected returnees are facing discrimination at the hands of their own villagers and within their community. “We are trying to raise awareness about the disease but it will take some time for the villagers to accept the new reality,” Pandey said.

Bardiya farmers are being forced to buy unnecessary variant of fertilisers,"The fertilisers scarcity in Bardiya has eased but farmers say they are paying a steep price as the suppliers have been forcing them to buy two types of fertilisers.The cooperatives dealing in chemical fertilisers have said that anyone buying urea should also buy SSP (Single Super Phosphate) even though farmers say they don’t need the latter.This has caused a financial burden on the farmers, many of whom are struggling to make a living due to the protracted lockdown imposed in response to the Covid-19 crisis. Farmers unwilling to purchase both variants of fertilisers are being turned away by the dealers. One sack of urea is priced Rs802 at the SSP at Rs1,200.Ashish Chaudhary, a farmer from Badhaiyatal, could not buy urea because he didn’t have the money to buy SSP. “I had saved Rs 1,000 so I could get a sack of urea, but the dealers said I needed to buy SSP too, which I don’t even need,” Chaudhary said. “I had to return empty-handed.”Without urea, Chaudhary says his paddy plants will not grow.“If the plants don’t get enough fertilisers they won’t flower well. I can’t afford to buy the fertiliser I need due to the condition set by the cooperatives,” Bachchu Chaudhary, another farmer, said. Mohan Singh KC, chief of Agriculture Inputs Company, Bardiya, said that the cooperatives’ manipulation of customers into buying the SSP is wrong, adding that his office only provides three variants of chemical fertilisers—urea, diammonium phosphate (DAP) and potash—to the cooperatives.“The suppliers are taking advantage of the crisis to earn some extra profit, which is condemnable,” he said. “It’s not right to manipulate thousands of farmers who are already struggling.”Ramesh Poudel, chief of Agriculture Inputs Company in Banke, said that he has received complaints regarding the cooperatives’ manipulation of farmers.Manoj Chaudhary, chief of Salt Trading Company Nepalgunj, which trades the SSP, said that his office hasn’t made it mandatory for farmers to buy SSP with urea. Prem Subedi, chief of District Cooperatives’ Association, said he is aware that many cooperatives have manipulated farmers into buying extra fertilisers, adding that the criteria is set by the Salt Trading Corporation itself, a claim Chaudhary, the chief of Salt Trading, denies.“Many farmers have been affected due to the shortage of fertilisers,” Subedi said. “The bigger problem than manipulation is the crisis itself.” The fertiliser crisis is far from over in the district, with barely one-third of its necessity of 12,000 tonnes currently in store with various dealers. A total of 120 cooperatives have been registered at the Agriculture Inputs Company but not all of them have been able to sell the fertilisers.The district administration has corresponded with the federal government demanding fertilisers but the latter hasn’t responded yet.Sagar Dhakal, chief of the Nepalgunj-based Agriculture Centre which oversees Banke and Bardiya districts, said if the shortage of chemical fertilisers continues, paddy production may decline by up to 35 percent this year.","Published at : June 14, 2020",Bardiya,Thakur Singh Tharu

According to the doctors at Nepalgunj Medical College, Kohalpur, the patient was diagnosed with acute intestinal obstruction, and was also found to have been infected with coronavirus. “The patient’s health condition was severely deteriorating when she was brought in,” said hospital director Dr Dinesh Shrestha. “We were prepared for the fact that the patient could be infected with coronavirus. So we tested her.”“We put the patient up at the isolation ward and performed an hour-long surgery on her.”A resident of Chaurpati Rural Municipality in Achham, the woman had returned from Maharashtra, India 10 days ago and had been living in a quarantine facility. She had been admitted at Bayalpata Hospital, Achham, four days ago after she complained of problems in her digestive system. Doctors at the hospital had referred the woman to the Kohalpur-based hospital after her condition worsened. Shrestha informed that doctors involved in the surgery took all necessary precautions during the surgery and all other services at the hospital were halted during the procedure.Pradip Thapa, a doctor involved in the surgery, said that the procedure became more complicated as the patient was brought in late and was already five months into her pregnancy.“The patient is still not out of danger,” said Thapa, “As of now, we can’t comment on her condition.”The hospital has also collected swab samples of the patient's husband and daughter who had accompanied her to the hospital.Thapa said that the foetus is healthy but the patient’s family have decided to terminate the pregnancy owing to the health complications of the mother.“There is high risk of infection after the surgery,” said Thapa, “And with the woman infected with Covid-19, we can’t say for sure that there won’t be further complications.”Meanwhile, medical personnel involved in the treatment of the woman have been sent to a quarantine facility at the hospital. They will treat other quarantined patients during their stay there, according to Shrestha.The Supreme Court, in an interim order on Wednesday, ordered the government to make special arrangements for pregnant women and their new-borns by making provisions for regular check-ups and vaccinations during the lockdown.","Published at : June 12, 2020",Banke,Madhu Shahi
District Court remands main accused of Rupandehi mass murder to seven days in custody,,,,
Five people murdered in Rupandehi farm; suspect in police custody,"A 32-year-old man was taken in police custody on the charge of murdering five people in Rupandehi district on Monday night. Police said the incident happened at a cattle farm in Maihiya Village of Tilottama Municipality Ward No. 10. Superintendent of Police Hem Kumar Thapa said the suspect, Jhasendra Sinjali, was a worker at the farm and he has been charged with the murder of three fellow workers and two others who were said to be spendin]g the night at the farm. The victims have been identified as Madhav Musahar, 40, and his wife Janaki, 37, both of them workers at the farm, and three teenagers Pokharaj Musahar, Karan Chaudhary and Ashish Chaudhary.“The victims were bludgeoned to death with a shovel. Their bodies were found at the same spot. Sinjali was found unconscious in a haystack near the farm,” said Inspector Laxman Thapa of the Area Police Office, Manglapur.Sinjali was taken to Crimson Hospital in Manigram for a medical check-up before he was transported to the Area Police Office in Butwal.People who knew Sinjali said he was an alcoholic and prone to mood swings.“We suspect that the accused man has some form of mental illness. He has repeatedly changed his statement about the incident,” Khadga Bahadur Khatri, spokesperson for the District Police Office, Rupandehi, said. Sinjali had joined the farm on April 28. The farm owner, Krishna Bahadur Pun, said he had come asking for a job during the lockdown. “He said he was in trouble because his wife left him and he had no money to sustain himself,” Pun said. “He looked like a decent person and he had done farm work before, so I hired him.” Pun said Sinjali was a good worker and the only thing bad about him was that he used to get drunk almost every evening. Sinjali used to eat at Pun’s house and sleep in a barn. On Monday night, Sinjali had left for the farm at 9pm. It was Pun who discovered the blood-soaked victims inside the barn. Their bodies were found lined up together. Police are investigating whether they were murdered at the same spot or their bodies were moved later. Sinjali, originally from Surkhet’s Lekbesi Municipality, had arrived in Butwal three years ago. He had worked in three farms before joining Pun’s farmland. Police said he had been removed from his previous jobs because of frequent fights with his wife. Ram Sahani, a previous employer of Sinjali, said he had removed the husband-wife duo from their jobs in late April after the wife attempted suicide following a fight with Sinjali. After the incident, Sinjali’s wife had moved to Butwal.“He used to get into brawls when drunk. He was drunk on Monday as well,” said Sandip Neupane, a local man. “Of late, he would talk about the pain of being abandoned by his wife.” Police said the incident has been all the more mysterious given all the dead were found lying together on the floor. Two of the victims, Madhav and his wife, used to sleep at a barn 15 metres from the incident site. Until 10 pm on Monday, they were at their sleeping quarters, according to Golari Musiyar, Madhav’s sister-in-law who lives in the adjacent room. “But they were not there at about 1am,” she said. Golari said Sinjali, who used to sleep at a nearby barn, called her at around the same time, knocking on her door. When she opened the door and scolded him for calling her so late in the night, he turned away before turning off the lights from the main switch. “I then checked my sister’s room and both my sister and her husband were not there. I was sick with fear and locked my room,” she said. The neighbour couple Krishna and Dil Bahadur Tharu said they didn’t hear any noise on Monday night. “We suspect that the victims were murdered in their sleep, as there were no signs of struggle,” Khatri, the spokesperson for the District Police Office, Rupandehi, said.Karan Musahar, the 18-year-old son of Madhav and Janaki, said that Sinjali used to get into brawls with his father ever since he joined the farm. “He had threatened to kill my parents in a fight just ten days ago,” Karan said. Karan and his ten-year-old brother Arjun were at their aunt’s home on Monday night.The provincial police has formed a three-member team led by SSP Rajkumar Baidawar to investigate the case. “We are taking statements from the suspect and he has admitted to the crime,” Baidawar said. “We will investigate the case from all angles.”","Published at : June 9, 2020",Butwal,Ghanashyam Gautam
Local governments in Dang are building additional isolation wards,"Several local governments in Dang district are constructing isolation facilities in their areas as the Covid-specific hospital in Beljhundi has run out of its capacity. With the 50-bed hospital full, 38 coronavirus patients are currently being kept in isolation at the quarantine centres set up in their respective areas. Rapti Rural Municipality has been constructing an isolation centre at Rapti Technical School in Lalmatiya with the assistance of Nepali Army. The local government is building an isolation facility with the capacity of holding 100 patients at a time.The isolation facility will be used to keep the patients from the Deukhuri region, which covers Rapti Rural Municipality, Lamahi Municipality, Gadhawa Rural Municipality and Rajpur Rural Municipality.“Since many infected patients are being kept in quarantine centres due to the shortage of isolation centers, we had no option than to increase our isolation capacity. We cannot keep the infected people and those observing quarantine at the same place for a long time,” said Numananda Subedi, chairman of Rapti Rural Municipality., According to Dr Pushpa Bhusal, a medical officer at Rapti Rural Municipality, said the isolation facility at Lalmatiya will be run by the medical teams from all four local units that fall in the Deukhuri region.“The health workers will work in shifts,” Bhusal said. “Only critical patients will be sent to the hospital in Beljhundi.” Likewise, Ghorahi Sub-metroplitan City has recently completed a 50-bed isolation facility in Ward No. 10.“Currently, we have a set-up that could keep 50 individuals. But we can expand the capacity of the facility up to 200 beds,” said Narulal Chaudhary, the city’s mayor.In Tulsipur Sub-metropolitan city, the local government has been building two isolation centres with the capacity of holding 50 patients.“We are converting the meeting hall of the Tulsipur Chamber of Commerce and Industries and the hostel building of Care Nursing Campus into isolation wards”, said Narulal Chaudhary, the mayor of Tulsipur.Bangalachuli Rural Municipality is also constructing a 50-bed isolation ward at Syuja Primary Health Centre. “We are currently isolating the coronavirus infected individuals in vacant buildings that were constructed under the People's Housing Programme. They will be moved to the isolation ward once the set-up has been completed,” said Bhakta Bahadur Oli, chairman of the rural municipality. Earlier, 16 health facilities in Dang had set up isolation wards with the combined capacity of accommodating 166 patients, including the 100-bed setup at Covid-specific hospital in Beljhundi. Chief District Officer Govinda Prasad Rijal said additional isolation wards were being built in various parts of the district because the facilities that were built earlier were either full or unwilling to admit patients.“Setting up new isolation wards was the only solution to address the issue,” he said.Although Beljhundi hospital has 100 beds, only 50 of them have been set aside to isolate coronavirus patients. “We are keeping 50 beds for those people whose test results have come negative in the second test. Patients have to undergo swab tests twice before they are cleared, so we have to separate the isolation beds for those who are infected and those who are in the recovery phase,” said Dr Sarbesh Sharma, a member secretary of the hospital. Meanwhile, Rapti Academy of Health Science in Ghorahi has refused to admit coronavirus infected people even though the Covid-specific hospital in Beljhundi has run out of beds.“The academy will admit Covid-19 patients in case the beds at Beljhundi hospital are full,” said Dr Sangita Bhandari, vice chancellor of the academy.She claimed that the reports about patients occupying all 100 beds in the Covid-specific hospital were untrue. “There are still vacant beds in the hospital. The reports about the hospital reaching its full occupancy are rumors,” she added. As of Sunday, 76 individuals have tested positive for coronavirus in Dang.","Published at : June 8, 2020",Dang,Durgalal KC
Man injured in Banke quarantine was not a victim of caste-related violence as portrayed on social media,"The attack on a man living in quarantine in Banke by three local volunteers on Wednesday was the result of an internal dispute at the facility over the day’s lunch, and not a instance of caste-related violence as portrayed on social media, police have said.On Wednesday, Karna Bahadur Saru Magar was attacked with a steel rod by three men volunteering at the quarantine facility.Magar, who was living in quarantine with his wife after returning from India, had gotten into a fight with the volunteers after people in quarantine were served different lunches. “The fight broke out after some people in quarantine did not get noodles for lunch,” said Superintendent Bir Bahadur Oli, chief of the  Banke District Police Office.“The three volunteers attacked Magar after he berated them for the disparity in lunch,"" said Oli.Magar sustained serious injuries to his head and was rushed to the Bheri Hospital in Nepalgunj. He was brought back to the quarantine facility after treatment.Police said the three men who attacked Magar - Shiva BK, Bhim Bahadur Sunar and Niraj Sunar - are at large.Misinformation about the incident had spread on social media, portraying Magar as a Dalit who was beaten for touching the cooking stove. Deepak Magar, Karna Bahadur’s brother-in-law, confirmed that the whole incident was over lunch. “I was shocked when I saw the social media claiming that the injured person was a Dalit and he was attacked for entering the kitchen,” said Deepak.The social media posts come at a time of heightened sensitivity for caste-related violence, with two recent cases of Dalits getting killed by other castes. Most recently, six men in Rukum (West), four of them Dalits, were killed during a marriage dispute with a different caste family.","Published at : June 6, 2020",Kathmandu,Shuvam Dhungana
Farmers in Bardiya brace for a poor paddy plantation season amid a scarcity of seeds and fertilisers,"When her two sons returned home on April 15 after three days of perilous travel from Kathmandu, Budhani Chaudhary was a happy mother.The two men, both in their early 20s, spent 15 days in quarantine before arriving home. Budhani was going to make use of their labour in fields, as it was prime plantation season. But there were new problems.The months-long lockdown meant that there were no jobs to take and hence, no money. Instead of an advanced breed of paddy seeds, she opted for a local breed. But then, there was a shortage of chemical fertilisers. Budhani would have taken a loan anyway, but fertilisers were unavailable anywhere in the district.These days, Budhani worries whether her spring plantation will bear any harvest. Like Budhani, a majority of farmers in Bardiya are struggling to get access to adequate seeds and fertilisers amidst the lockdown. Many farmers have yet to begin plantation.Som Chaudhary of Badhaiyatal Rural Municipality in Bardiya turned to farming when he couldn’t return to his meat shop in Pokhara due to the lockdown. He had planned to plant paddy on the 1.5 bigha (10,159 sq m) of land his family has leased. But he faced problems from the very beginning. He struggled to get his hands on paddy seeds, which he received later and at a very high price, he said.“There is an acute crisis of seeds and fertilisers,” said Som. “If the government doesn’t come up with any means to tackle this, paddy production will dip significantly this year.” Som, for his part, has managed to obtain chemical fertilisers—100kgs each of urea and diammonium phosphate.Prior to the pandemic, advanced breeds of seeds and chemical fertilisers would be imported from various Indian cities, according to Lal Bahadur Shrestha, chief of Badhaiyatal Rural Municipality. If there was a shortage in the local market, farmers could easily travel to the India border to purchase it. But the Covid-19 crisis has affected supply chains and closed down fertiliser factories, leading to shortages in the market. Nepal requires 120,000 tonnes of urea and 50,000 tonnes of DAP for paddy plantation alone, according to officials at the Agriculture Ministry. Currently, Nepal only has 35,000 tonnes of DAP and 25,000 tonnes of urea in stock.“The lockdown has halted imports and also prevented farmers from travelling to Indian towns to purchase seeds and fertilisers,” said Shrestha. On May 27, the Bardiya District Administration Office wrote a letter to the federal Agriculture Ministry and the provincial ministry of social development, notifying them about the scarcity of fertilisers. In the letter, the office had requested at least 4,000 metric tons of urea, 2,500 tonnes of DAP, and 100 tonnes of potash.But, the government is planning to provide only a fraction of what the district needs, said Shrestha. “The government’s Agriculture Inputs Company has offered 300 metric tons of urea and 200 metric tons of DAP, less than 10 percent of our demands,” he said. “This small amount now risks chaos as farmers will flock en masse to the distribution centre. If the fertiliser scarcity extends for a week longer, paddy production in the district will likely decline by as much as 50 percent.”Mohan Singh KC, chief of the Agriculture Inputs Company in Bardiya, said that they now only have 50 tonnes of DAP in stock. According to KC, Bardiya needs a total of 12,000 tonnes of chemical fertilisers, including urea, potash and DAP. Farmers are now purchasing fertilisers and seeds smuggled over from India at exorbitant prices. “I purchased five kilos of hybrid paddy seeds at Rs 550 per kilo, which is higher than last year,” said 52-year-old Prakash Tharu. “But that investment will be in vain if I’m not able to get fertilisers on time after transplanting the seedlings.” On Thursday morning, a group of farmers were waiting outside a local cooperative in Khajura, Banke for fertilisers. Jahir Khan, a local farmer, said that he had been there every day for the past three day. “But I haven’t got any fertiliser,” he said. “Four days ago, I sowed paddy seeds in two bighas of land. If I’m unable to place fertilisers within a few days, they will not grow properly.” According to Nirmal Khanal, chair of Khajura cooperative, there’s only a limited stock of fertiliser left in the godown. “The distribution of fertiliser has temporarily stopped as the remaining stock will not be adequate for all,” said Khanal. “We are trying to purchase fertiliser from Salt Trading and other places, but even they don’t have fertilisers.” Agriculture experts are afraid that this shortage could lead to widespread food insecurity and an even bigger increase in Nepal’s reliance on food imports. According to Sagar Dhakal, chief of the Agriculture Knowledge Centre in Nepalgunj which overlooks both Banke and Bardiya, this year’s paddy harvest could see a fall by 15 to 20 percent. “If there is any shortage of fuel and irrigation, a further 25 to 30 percent of the harvest could be lost,” said Dhakal. A decade ago, Bardiya had 75,000 hectares of cultivable land. But, the recent data showed that paddy cultivation is being done in around 46,000 hectares. Dhakal adds, “If the distribution of fertiliser and seeds is not eased and the lockdown prolongs, the production could fall and people might face famine this year.”As the price of paddy seeds and fertilisers skyrockets in the face of the shortages, Budhani’s two sons Khusi Ram and Kailash are scrounging for money. But they haven’t been paid for the work they did in Kathmandu. Khusi Ram is owed Rs 29,000 and Kailash Rs 5,500, both of whom work as daily wage labourers in the construction sector. Meen Bahadur Raut, the duo’s contractor, while speaking to the Post, promised to pay their wages in a few days’ time.For Budhani, paddy plantation might already be a lost cause. She is now concerned with having enough to eat for as long as the lockdown lasts. “In this crisis, it will be some relief for a few days if my sons get their wages,” she said.","Published at : June 6, 2020",Bardiya,Thakur Singh Tharu						 &
"In Narainapur, the worst appears to be over but fears remain","Lazim Nau of Narainapur Rural Municipality in Banke had gone to a brick kiln looking for work on May 14. He was going to be paid Rs 500 for every thousand bricks he burned. He stayed on the brick kiln premises for a few days, as he didn’t want to walk nine kilometres back home. On the third day, May 17, he was in the midst of burning bricks when a villager arrived with news. “It was unbelievable. He told me that my eldest son was dead,” 52-year-old Lazim told the Post while standing in the courtyard of his home in Narainapur.Anish, Lazim’s 25-year-old son, had been in quarantine at the Dipendra Basic School ever since he had returned from Mumbai on May 12. He had come home after the restaurant where he worked closed.According to officials at the rural municipality, Anish had complained of a headache and had been vomiting since the previous night. Despite his health condition worsening overnight, nobody dared take Anish to the hospital as they suspected he had Covid-19. Anish died at 6:40 am the next morning. When nose and throat swabs taken from Anish tested positive for Covid-19, he became the country’s second fatality from the coronavirus. Anish’s family believes that he would’ve lived if he had been taken to the hospital on time, as he was young and healthy. “My brother died because he was not taken to the hospital,” said Farid, Anish’s younger brother. “But whom should we complain to? Who will listen to us?” Banke, with 255 cases as of Thursday, is among the districts with the highest number of Covid-19 cases. Of these 255 cases, 118 were in the rural municipality of Narainapur alone. And many believe that the poor state of the quarantine facilities has been largely to blame for the explosion of cases. Krishnachandra Maurya, chair of Ward No 5 in the rural municipality, himself admitted that the number of cases increased in Narainapur as they failed to manage proper quarantine facilities and maintain physical distancing. On March 18, the local authorities had estimated that around 500 individuals would return to the village from India. The rural municipality accordingly set up four health desks. But over 900 individuals entered Nepal from India in just three days, overwhelming the quarantine facilities.But ever since the beginning, quarantine facilities have been crowded and mismanaged. There were no health workers and there were problems accommodating newcomers with a shortage of food. There were no health workers deputed to the quarantine facilities, which could’ve helped save Anish’s life. With cases rising, primarily inside quarantine, on May 10, Narainapur Rural Municipality wrote a letter to the District Administration Office requesting a high-level doctor’s team and more security personnel as the situation was on the verge of spiralling out of control. The rural municipality had also notified the Office of Prime Minister and Council of Ministers, the Home Ministry and the Province 5 government of the same risk. On May 12, the rural municipality started construction of more quarantine facilities. A total of 19 facilities were constructed in various parts of the rural municipality, housing 978 individuals. Among them, 709 have returned to their homes while 153 remain, and new cases continue to be identified, albeit at a much lower rate.With the number of people living in quarantine decreasing, district officials said that they have decreased the number of quarantine facilities to just three and improved the state of the facilities. Inspector Man Bahadur GC of the police post in Bhagwanpur, said that the number of newcomers to Narainapur has decreased since May 24. “Very few individuals are crossing the border from illegal routes too. We estimate that around 1,200 individuals have entered Narainapur from India since the beginning of the lockdown.” said GC. According to data from the rural municipality, around 300 individuals have yet to arrive in the coming days from India.The number of new cases might have decreased but locals say they cannot feel safe until testing is done at the community level. The rural municipality has so far focused on keeping newcomers in quarantine and conducting tests. “Until now, we have only conducted 11 tests of locals in the village,” said Istiyak Ahmed Sah, chair of the rural municipality. “We are mainly focused on testing individuals who returned from India. But we realise it is necessary to conduct testing of locals.” According to a security official deployed at a quarantine facility, contact tracing of those who’ve tested positive for Covid-19 has not been done effectively. “But local officials do not seem to accept this fact,” he said on condition of anonymity. “It is not possible to stay safe until testing is expanded at the community level.” Meanwhile, Roj Ali, Anish’s youngest brother, remains in quarantine since returning from India, and Lazim remains afraid for his youngest son. Frequently asked questions about the coronavirus outbreakUPDATED as of September 22, 2020What is Covid-19?Covid-19, short for coronavirus disease, is an illness caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, short for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Common symptoms of the disease include fever, dry cough, fatigue, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In severe cases, the infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. How contagious is Covid-19?Covid-19 can spread easily from person to person, especially in enclosed spaces. The virus can travel through the air in respiratory droplets produced when a sick person breathes, talks, coughs or sneezes. As the virus can also survive on plastic and steel surfaces for up to 72 hours and on cardboard for up to 24 hours, any contact with such surfaces can also spread the virus. Symptoms take between two to 14 days to appear, during which time the carrier is believed to be contagious.Where did the virus come from?The virus was first identified in Wuhan, China in late December. The coronavirus is a large family of viruses that is responsible for everything from the common cold to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). After an initial outbreak in Wuhan that spread across Hubei province, eventually infecting over 80,000 and killing more than 3,000, new infection rates in mainland China have dropped. However, the disease has since spread across the world at an alarming rate.   What is the current status of Covid-19?The World Health Organisation has called the ongoing outbreak a “pandemic” and urged countries across the world to take precautionary measures. Covid-19 has spread to 213 countries and territories around the world and infected more than 31,405,983 people with 967,505 deaths and 22,990,260 recoveries. In South Asia, India has reported the highest number of infections at 5,557,573 with 88,943 deaths. While Pakistan has reported 306,304 confirmed cases with 6,420 deaths. Nepal has so far reported 65,276 cases with 427 deaths.How dangerous is the disease?The mortality rate for Covid-19 is estimated to be 3.6 percent, but new studies have put the rate slightly higher at 5.7 percent. Although Covid-19 is not too dangerous to young healthy people, older individuals and those with immune-compromised systems are at greater risk of death. People with chronic medical conditions like heart disease, diabetes and lung disease, or those who’ve recently undergone serious medical procedures, are also at risk. How do I keep myself safe?The WHO advises that the most important thing you can do is wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizers with at least 60 percent alcohol content. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unclean hands. Clean and disinfect frequently used surfaces like your computers and phones. Avoid large crowds of people. Seek medical attention if symptoms persist for longer than a few days.Is it time to panic?No. The government has imposed a lockdown to limit the spread of the virus. There is no need to begin stockpiling food, cooking gas or hand sanitizers. However, it is always prudent to take sensible precautions like the ones identified above.","Published at : June 5, 2020",Banke,Janakraj Sapkota
Lack of trained medical staff exacerbates Kapilvastu’s Covid-19 response,"On Monday, a police personnel guarding an isolation centre at Aniruddha Secondary in Yashodhara Rural Municipality reached the local unit’s health bureau with the news that two individuals at the centre were taken ill with diarrhoea—one of the less common symptoms of Covid-19. The policeman asked the bureau’s health workers to attend to the patients. But the health personnel declined to visit the centre, which currently has 88 Covid-infected individuals. The officials at the bureau returned the policeman with antidiarrheal drugs.Kapilvastu has so far reported 337 cases of Covid-19 spread across all its 10 local units. While the district administration is scrambling to locate the infected and suspects at quarantine facilities and isolation centres, it is also grappling with a shortage of medical staff. Even those that are available refuse to visit isolation centres, as in Monday’s case.“We don’t have enough personal protective equipment or the skills to handle highly infectious diseases,” said Jyoti Prakash Dubey, chief of the Yashodhara health bureau. “To directly attend to the patients without proper knowledge is to risk one’s life and theirs. So we inspect the isolation centres without actually engaging with the patients.” The isolation centre lacks physicians who are trained to treat Covid-19 patients, Dubey added.Aniruddha isolation centre represents the state of the district’s Covid-19 response. The protocol demands that the isolation centres have doctors, staff nurses, paramedic staff and an ambulance on standby. But most of the isolation centres in the district are led by senior auxiliary health workers, except the one in Mayadevi Rural Municipality which has doctors and staff nurses.The district has reported the highest Covid-19 cases in the country. As many as 4,500 people are quarantined, most of whom are returnees from India. Cross-border movements are on the rise and the number of returnees is increasing by the day. But the quarantine and isolation centres in the district are struggling with the management.Chief District Officer Dirgha Narayan Poudel said that a May 22 meeting of the district-level Crisis Management Committee had decided to ask the provincial government for 30 skilled health workers, including ten physicians and 20 staff nurses. Eleven days since the demand, the provincial government has yet to respond.Province 5 has been struggling to contact trace Covid-19 suspects and manage quarantine centres, most of which are crowded and mismanaged. Yashodhara, for instance, has reported 100 cases but there has been no contact tracing of the infected. This is due to a lack of manpower and Viral Transport Medium (VTM) kits, according to Dubey. “There’s been no contact tracing since the first 12 cases,” he said. “We are in no situation to start it now.”","Published at : June 3, 2020",Kapilvastu,Manoj Paudel
"Allowing microbus to run without permit was mistake, district authorities admit","Banke District Administration has concluded that Sunday night’s microbus incident took place as the vehicle was allowed to take to the road without a proper permit. The administration has admitted its mistake after an assessment of the accident in a Tuesday meeting.The packed microbus had rammed into a parked truck in Banke on Sunday night, killing twelve passengers and injuring 21.“Allowing a drunk driver to drive a microbus without a permit and with more passengers more than the vehicle’s capacity are grave mistakes that led to the accident,” said Chief District Officer Ram Bahadur Kurumbang. “There will be an investigation into the incident. We have learned a lesson and have started arranging proper transport facilities for returnees heading home.”After the incident, the Area Police Jamunaha has stepped up security checks, said Superintendent Madhav Rijal. “We have received complaints that passenger vehicles are picking up passengers on their way to their destinations. We are investigating that as well,” he said.Deg Nath Gautam, chair of Bheri Transportation Entrepreneurs Association, said that only those vehicles with route permit passes have been used to ferry returnees from India. Gautam, however, defended the association’s choice to charge double than the usual fare. He blamed the administration for the accident. “Why did the administration allow a vehicle without a pass to ferry passengers?” he said.","Published at : June 2, 2020",Banke,Thakur Singh Tharu
A community forest in Palpa smuggling timber during lockdown,"A community forest in Tansen Municipality, Palpa, has been illegally smuggling timber in the district of late.Taking advantage of the nationwide lockdown, the consumers committee of Tilahar Sakhar Salleri Community Forest in Tansen-11 has logged nearly threefold more trees than it was permitted to and smuggled the logs to a timber trader. Security personnel detained Ganesh Prasad Ghimire and Amar Bahadur Pun, the chairman and treasurer of the forest consumers’ committee respectively, on Tuesday for investigation. Trader Nabin Ghimire was also nabbed in connection with the incident.“The accused trio have been kept in custody at the District Police Office for investigation,” said Arjun Prasad Chapagain, an investigation officer at the forest office. According to him, preliminary investigation shows that the committee cut down 3,526 cubic feet more timber than it got permission from the forest office. “A case will be filed against them at the district court through the office of the district's attorney. They will be punished as per the Forest Act 2019,” said Chapagain.Yamlal Pokharel, a ranger at the forest office, said that the division forest office had permitted the community forest to cut down 2,074 cubic feet timber, but the community forest was found logging 5,600 cubic feet timber, he added. Police suspect that the forest consumers’ committee officials worked in collusion with the timber traders by taking advantage of the poor security at the forest area during the lockdown. According to the local people, the forest consumers’ committee had illegally cut down trees last year as well, but the authorities concerned were unaware about it. Besides Tilahar Sakhar Salleri Community Forest, many such forests in the district are illegally logging trees for smuggling purposes, locals say.","Published at : June 2, 2020",Palpa,Madhab Ayral
"Dozen die, 21 injured as microbus rams into parked truck in Banke","12 individuals, who were returning to Nepal from India amid the coronavirus pandemic lost their lives in an accident in Rapti Sonari Rural Municipality, Banke at around midnight on Sunday. Twenty-one others were injured in the same accident.While 11 people, including the driver of the microbus and his assistant died on the spot, a passenger died receiving treatment at Nepalgunj-based Bheri Hospital on Monday morning.In the past two months, Nepal has seen a huge number of migrant workers returning from India, making their way towards their home country for sustaining in India without a source of income is becoming increasingly difficult for them. Since the time both the countries put the lockdown in place some two months ago, a trickle of returnees slowly turned into a massive influx, some walking long distances from various cities in India to Nepal. The 12 who had boarded the vehicle in Nepalgunj for Dang on Sunday night were also migrant workers working in cities like Chandigarh and Shimla in India. They had reached Nepalgunj without food or sleep for the last three days. One among them was Ram Kumar Pun of Dang, a daily wage worker in Chandigarh. He was living through tough days in Chandigarh without work and means to sustain himself. He was worried about contracting coronavirus and wanted to return home, says his older brother Ramesh Pun. He decided to make his way home but did not have enough money to support his journey. He called Ramesh in Dang and informed him about his predicament. “He said he didn’t have money so I had told him I’ll send some for him to be able to reach home. But he refused,” said Ramesh, who had come to receive his brother’s dead body in Nepalgunj-based Bheri hospital on Monday. “After the railway services resumed in India, he got onto one of the trains and somehow made his way to the border. He had borrowed money from his friends in Chandigarh and reached Jamunaha border point on Sunday,” said Ramesh. “He had called me after entering Nepal. He said he would be home soon.”""The accident took place after the Hiace microbus (BA 5 KHA 5995) rammed into a parked truck (SA 4 KHA 9064) near the Thuriya forest in Ward No. 2 of the rural municipality, along the East-West Highway,” said Kuldip Chand, Deputy Superintendent of Police of the Area Police Office in Kohalpur. “The loaded truck had broken down on the road,"" he added. The impact of the hit was such that the truck was pushed some 45 metres away from its stationary position. At the time of the accident, there were 33 people in the vehicle including the driver. Among them, two were the driver’s friends and one assistant, rest were all passengers on their way towards their home districts. The 21 injured are receiving treatment in Bheri Hospital. Most of the injured recall the vehicle overspeeding on its way to Dang. “We were feeling dizzy inside the vehicle due to overspeeding. We told the driver to slow down but he did not listen to us,” said Bishnu Giri, a local of Tulsipur in Dang, and one of the survivors of the accident. Another injured, Meghraj KC from Dang, says the driver was inebriated. “We were soon to leave Nepalgunj but the driver got off the vehicle and said he would first have his meal. When he came back he was drunk,” said KC. “We were scared because he started overspeeding as soon as he got behind the wheel. We asked him to drive slow but he did not listen.” Mukesh Gharti, a local of Salyan, who was working as a daily wage worker in Shimla, India, was one among the survivors. He also decided to return to Nepal when his employer stopped paying him his salary because of the lockdown. He was fast running out of money because he hadn’t been paid for the past two months, he says. With the possible scenario of running out of food and being infected with coronavirus, he concluded that leaving for home was the next best thing for him to do. “We were a group of nine workers in Shimla; we decided to leave for Nepal when it became increasingly difficult for us to survive there. We booked a vehicle paying IRs 3,600 per person and reached the Jamunaha border point from Shimla. We have no money left now. We used all our savings to reach the border,” said Gharti. “We haven’t had a proper meal in the past three days. We had only water to drink until we reached Jamunaha.” Gharti and his friends had boarded a vehicle from Shimla that dropped them off at Rupaidiha, the Indian side of the border. He was with Nepali workers from Salyan, Dang, Rolpa and other districts. “We reached Rupaidiha but the Indian security personnel did not let us stay there for long. We were asked to leave the area as soon as we got out of the vehicle,” said Gharti. “They stared baton charging at us and some even sustained injuries. A group of 29 including Gharti soon boarded a tipper truck sent by Nepalgunj Sub-metropolis. They reached Jamunaha at around 6pm on Sunday.The tipper truck dropped the locals of Banke to their settlements whereas the people of other districts were left stranded at Jamunaha. Since only a few hours were left for nightfall and with no place to take shelter for the night, the group of 29 decided to look for vehicles leaving for Dang. They met a driver of a Hiace microbus willing to take them to Dang although at a much higher price than the normal fare. The driver charged Rs 1,800 per person for the trip whereas the actual fare is around Rs 400. “We were 29 of us and only 17 had the money to pay for the fare. The rest of us said we would pay once we reach home. The microbus was a 16-seater but the driver said he would take all 29 of us,” said Gharti. “There were no security checks anywhere.” Another survivor, Sunil Pariyar from Rolpa, had also made his way to Jamunaha border point from Chandigarh. “When we reached Jamunaha, the police brought us to the passenger unit at Nepalgunj customs point. Then we searched for a vehicle and came across a Hiace microbus. We paid more than double the fare to the driver to take us to Dang,” he said. According to Pariyar, the driver dilly-dallied in Nepalgunj and left for Dang only around 11pm. “We were waiting since six in the evening; we were thirsty, hungry and sleepy. The vehicle picked up speed as soon as we started moving. Most of us were half-asleep by then while some were holding on to their seats. Many of my friends asked the driver to slow down. But the driver insisted that he had to reach Dang as soon as possible and return to Nepalgunj,” he said. The next thing Pariyar remembers is falling off the seat when the microbus rammed into the stationary truck. “Most of the passengers were unconscious. Some of them had died on impact. Three of us sustained minor injuries. When I looked around I could see blood splattered everywhere. No one came to our rescue immediately and I didn’t know how to get in touch with the police. I don’t know who informed the police, but soon the police arrived and brought us to the hospital.” This story has been updated.","Published at : June 1, 2020",Nepalgunj,Thakur Singh Tharu						 &
Migrant force who returned to villages from India dwell on staying back,"On May 13, 18-year-old Tula Bahadur Saru of Dhatiwang in Pandini Rural Municipality, Arghakhanchi was busy constructing an irrigation canal in his village. Under the Smart Agriculture Programme, he has been employed to construct the Damai-Urleni irrigation canal at Rs 700 daily wage. Tula Bahadur said, “I came to the village before the nationwide lockdown started. I came back to apply for my citizenship but I can’t go back now with the lockdown and the risk of contracting coronavirus.”He had gone to Bhopal in India in search of employment a year ago. Tula Bahadur’s friends, who returned to the village along with him, are also busy working on various development projects since their return. Maniraj Paudel, a local of Dhatiwang, also returned to his village from India recently. “I have spent so much of my life toiling in a foreign country. I think now I will stay back in my village,” said Paudel. Kamala Kumal, from Dhurkot in Gulmi, returned to her village also from India after both Nepal and India put the lockdown in place. She had stayed in a quarantine facility for 14 days after her return to the local unit. She reached her village from the facility a couple of days ago. “I back in my village now but right now there’s no work available here,” said Kumal. “If the local unit creates job opportunity for us here, I’d like to stay back rather than returning to India as a wage worker.”Tuka Bahadur Saru, a local resident of Purbakhola in Palpa, is busy in household activities these days. He also recently reached to his village after spending 16 days at a quarantine facility in Siluwa. “I had gone to work in Mumbai. But now, I don’t want to,” he said. “I will find something to do in the village itself.” According to the data available at various local units, more than 2,000 individuals entered Gulmi villages; 1,300 entered Palpa and 2,500 entered Arghakhanchi from India and other countries after mid-March. But the local units have not made any plans and policies to manage the labour force who have returned in huge numbers. Bhupal Pokharel, chairman of Dhurkot Rural Municipality in Gulmi said that they are working on ways to utilise the labour force at home. Nuna Bahadur Thapa, chairman of Purbakhola Rural Municipality in Palpa, also said the local unit plans to keep the workforce in the villages. “We will create some job opportunities and make a conducive environment for them to stay in the villages.” According to Topa Bahadur Saru, the ward chairman of Pandini Rural Municipality Ward No. 6, the rural municipality has decided to provide up to 75 percent grant for locals who would want to start commercial agriculture including vegetable farming. “We have started to collect data of newcomers in the settlements. We must create an environment for them to settle them in the villages,” said the ward chair. Likewise, Ribdikot Rural Municipality in Palpa plans to mobilise the migrant workers in the construction of rural roads, irrigation canals and other development activities. Narayan Bahadur GC, chairman of the rural municipality, said, “We will provide daily wages to the workers for their work. This will also help in the development of the rural municipality,” said GC, adding that they also plan to provide cash relief to the workers on the basis of their work performance. Ribdikot Rural Municipality has been collecting the data of newcomers to provide them with employment opportunities at the local level.Meanwhile, migrant workers, who recently returned to Ghorahi Sub Metropolis Ward No. 1, have started to cultivate cash crops in lands that have lain barren for want of human resource. They also aim to make their ward self-sufficient in food grains and avoid a possible financial crunch. They have started to cultivate ginger, turmeric and lemon plants in the barren lands at Terchhegaun. Around five bighas of land in Terchhegaun lay barren since most of the population had migrated elsewhere in search of employment in the last 12 years. Out of the 30 households in the ward, there are only eight families who live in the village all year around.Tekan Bhandari, a native of the village, who had been working in India for the past 12 years as a daily wage worker, said, “Fifteen of us returned from India and all of us have started to cultivate ginger, turmeric, and lemon in the barren land.” Agriculture and Women groups in the local units have also started encouraging locals to use their vocational skills to make various household items these days. “We have asked them to make bamboo baskets, leaf plates and other items locally. We will help them sell those products in the market,” said Dhruba Raj Paudel, chairman of the Sarbottam Multipurpose Cooperative Limited in Ghorahi. Durgalal KC in Dang contributed reporting.","Published at : May 26, 2020",Palpa,Madhab Aryal
Narainapur declared ‘prohibited area’ as chaos and misinformation continues,"On Friday, 13 more people from Narainapur in Banke were diagnosed with Covid-19. All of them fled their quarantine facility soon after they knew that they were infected.The situation turned chaotic with all of them going into hiding, assisted by their family members and locals, police said. Nearly 1,000 people gathered at the quarantine facility soon as the news of infection spread and encircled the ambulances that were there to carry the infected to isolation centres.The infected fled the centre while the locals began arguing with the police, who couldn’t locate the former that night. They were detained the next day, after dozens of security personnel were deployed.Narainapur has become the coronavirus hotspot in Province 5 with as many as 114 people infected so far. The rural municipality in Banke is ill-equipped to deal with the situation, with no isolation wards to house the infected.Prior to this, a similar situation played out on Monday when as many as 57 individuals were infected and they were left at the quarantine facility for over a day because of a lack of isolation wards in the district. The locals protested, arguing that the infected be sent home. The infected were moved to an isolation ward in Nepalgunj on Wednesday morning.On Saturday, 27 more individuals from the same local unit were diagnosed with the virus. The police said they are maintaining stern vigilance this time, lest the previous episodes repeat.To understand these episodes, one should look beneath the surface of the incidents, says Binay Dixit, a local youth leader. “Many locals have suddenly found themselves into this new reality and they are struggling to make sense of the situation,” Dixit said.“Many are traumatised, emotions run high every day at the quarantine centres. Sights of family members of the infected sobbing while at the quarantine centres are common. They want the infected to be treated in their own locality.”But for a remote region as Narainapur, treatment of Covid-19 at the local unit is not possible. The local unit only has one primary health post, which lacks resources, even electricity. Dixit points to the failure of the local units and health workers to sufficiently aware the people: “There are rumours in the villages. The family members worry that their dear ones would be placed liked prisoners in the isolation wards and would be deprived of food. The rumours are so wild that some families worry kidneys would be taken out of the infected.”Rural Municipality chief Istiyak Ahmed Shah also said rumours and fake news have led many infected to flee the quarantine centres. “Even the noted leaders are spreading rumours, but I don’t understand why the district administration is silent about it,” Shah said.Krishna Chandra Maurya, chief of Narainapur-5, said that the chaotic situation would continue in the future if isolation wards are not set up in the local unit itself.“The locals worry about sending their infected family members away,” he said. “If there was an isolation ward in the local unit the family members would be consoled as they could see and talk with the infected every day. We wouldn’t have to see chaotic situations like this.”For the security personnel handling the strange situation in Narainapur, every day is harder than the previous, said DSP Shiva Bahadur Singh, spokesperson for the District Police. “We have had to deter the agitating protesters twice while we try to move the infected to an isolation ward for the safety of the local unit,” he said. “This is not the proper atmosphere for us to work. We expect support from everyone but that’s been hard to come by.”Mismanaged quarantines and poor regulations have contributed to a surge in the number of infected in the local unit, Rajan Pandey, chief of medical bureau at Bheri Hospital, told the Post.Province 5 has been roundly criticised for its mismanaged and crowded quarantine facilities, with a fresh protest against it erupting in Kotahimai Rural Municipality in Rupandehi on Saturday. The residents of ward 6 decried the poor management in the quarantine facility at Bogadi Secondary School and sloganeered against the rural municipality chief Chandra Bhusan Yadav.Nishant Pandey, a local of Kotahimai, said that the centre—which has 70 individuals, all of them India returnees—has not managed its garbage properly and the quarantined individuals are found to have visited the local grocery stores. “We have notified the local unit chief about the slack regulations but haven’t heard anything in response,” he said. “We were compelled to stage a protest.” Citing the obstructions in transportation of Covid patients, the Banke District Security Committee on Sunday deployed the Army and declared Narainapur Rural Municipality as Prohibited Area. The order comes into effect from 8pm Sunday, according to the district administration. Following the repeated incidents of protests and the chaos, the rural municipality had corresponded with the District Administration and the Prime Minister’s Office for better security arrangements.“If the protests and obstructions continue, then there's a high chance of rapid community transfer [of the disease],” Hari Pyakurel, the assistant CDO of Banke, said. “We are compelled to declare the local unit a prohibited area.” The meeting of the security committee has also decided to deploy physicians at the local unit while taking initiatives to set up isolation wards at the local unit itself. “There is no electricity in the local unit, so we will use a generator instead,” Pyakurel said. “Works to set up the isolation ward will begin soon.” (Sanju Paudel and Rupa Gahatraj contributed reporting.)","Published at : May 24, 2020",Banke,Thakur Singh Tharu
Narainapur Covid-19 patients finally moved to isolation ward,"Fifty-nine people infected with the coronavirus have finally been moved from Narainapur Rural Municipality, Banke to an isolation ward, more than 24 hours since they were diagnosed with Covid-19. The infected were quarantined in Narainapur as the district lacked an isolation ward. The Nepalgunj-based Lions Dental Hospital, where the infected have been moved, however, has only 25 beds in the isolation ward.According to Deputy Mayor Uma Thapa, the Nepalgunj Sub-metropolitan City earlier decided to place 25 infected in the isolation ward and 34 others in a makeshift isolation ward set up at Kohalpur-based Agriculture Development Bank. That plan, however, is yet to materialise, and all the infected would be placed at the Lions until new arrangements are made, Thapa said.“Resources at the hospital are not enough, but we will place them here until other arrangements are made,” she said. “The risk is low as none of the infected has shown symptoms of the disease.”As per the amended plan, 23 individuals would be placed at the Lions and the rest at the ADB’s isolation ward in Kohalpur, according to Thapa. Meanwhile, locals in Kohalpur have protested the district administration’s decision to move the infected to their locality.The infected were placed at various quarantine centres in Narainapur for the lack of space and equipment for an isolation ward in the vicinity. The province has scrambled to manage resources as the number of Covid-19 patients has surged over the week. Ninety-nine individuals have been diagnosed with the viral disease so far in Banke, with the Health Ministry confirming six coronavirus cases in the district on Wednesday.On Tuesday afternoon, Narainapur descended into chaos as the locals protested against the district administration’s decision to move the infected to Nepalgunj and Kohalpur without proper measures. Locals had argued that since all the infected have been asymptomatic, they should be allowed to go home.The infected were moved in two lots, on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning.","Published at : May 20, 2020",Banke,Rupa Gahatraj
Narainapur descends into chaos with Covid-19 patients yet to be moved to isolation wards,"As many as 59 Covid-19 patients are still housed at the quarantine centre for a lack of isolation wards at Narainapur Rural Municipality-5, in Banke. A total of 68 individuals have tested positive for the coronavirus in Narainapur alone. In Banke, the number has hit 93, the highest in the country.Narainapur is fast becoming the most active Covid-19 hotspot, with 59 infections diagnosed on Monday alone. There’s widespread fear among health workers that the infection will enter communities.Bheri Hospital’s chief of medical bureau Rajendra Pandey said infection was already widespread in Narainapur. “The worst is yet to come. The spread has been rampant because of mismanaged quarantine centres,” he said.Fears among public as well as health workers have further escalated after a 25-year-old man died of Covid-19 at a quarantine facility in Narainapur on Sunday. The man had recently returned from Maharastra state in India on foot and was stranded at the border for a day before he was placed at the facility set up at Dipendra Secondary in Narainapur on May 12, according to rural municipality officials.His swabs were collected on Saturday, and by the evening his health condition had started to deteriorate, according to the office of the rural municipality. He was diagnosed with Covid-19 on Sunday afternoon at Bheri Hospital lab, hours after his death.According to Prem Buda, in-charge of the quarantine facility, the deceased had suffered from diarrhoea and reported a headache the previous night. He was given Jeevan Jal (rehydration solution), which proved to be of little help. Locals have decried the authorities failure to mount effective response against the virus. They said the man who died in quarantine would have survived had he been taken to the hospital when he started to show symptoms.To move the infected from quarantine facilities, Province 5 government has decided to set up an isolation ward at a primary health centre in Narainapur but there’s a lack of manpower and equipment necessary for the isolation ward, provincial offficials say.Locals have demanded that there should be at least a primary health centre-level facility to treat the infected people.But there’s a lack of isolation wards in the whole district with the Covid-19 specific Sushil Koirala Prakhar Hospital in Khajura already full with patients. The hospital has a capacity of 26 beds. The health centre in Narainapur lacks electricity, according to Istiak Ahmed Shah, chief of Narainapur Rural Municipality.The eight infected on Friday were taken to Beljhundi’s Covid-19 specific hospital in Dang. In Narainapur, 68 people have been diagnosed with the disease so far. The rural municipality has 13 quarantine centres with 718 individuals.The rural municipality is currently sealed. Banke’s Chief District Officer Kumar Bahadur Khadka said that the local unit has been declared a “high-risk zone”. “The movement of people is completely restricted in the local unit,” he said.Assistant Chief District Officer Hari Pyakurel said that the local primary health centre has been designated for the treatment of the coronavirus patients, with private hospitals in Nepalgunj assisting with extra beds.But on Tuesday afternoon, the 57 infected in Narainapur rejected the district administration’s plan to move them to the isolation wards in Nepalgunj. Meanwhile, locals in Narainapur have been demanding the authorities to send the quarantined people home, arguing that they have shown no symptoms of the disease.With the Khajura-based Sushil Koirala Prakhar Hospital full to its capacity and a lack of resources at the local primary health centre, the infected are still housed at the quarantine centres. But a meeting of district administration on Tuesday afternoon decided to move the infected to Lions Dental Hospital in Nepalgunj and to the seminar hall at Kohalpur-based Agriculture Development Bank, which would be turned to an isolation ward.Pyakurel said that while the ambulances to transport the patients are on standby at the quarantine centres, there is risk that the infected may leave the facilities. “The district administration has therefore deployed police personnel around the area,” he said.  Frequently asked questions about the coronavirus outbreakUPDATED as of September 22, 2020What is Covid-19?Covid-19, short for coronavirus disease, is an illness caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, short for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Common symptoms of the disease include fever, dry cough, fatigue, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In severe cases, the infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. How contagious is Covid-19?Covid-19 can spread easily from person to person, especially in enclosed spaces. The virus can travel through the air in respiratory droplets produced when a sick person breathes, talks, coughs or sneezes. As the virus can also survive on plastic and steel surfaces for up to 72 hours and on cardboard for up to 24 hours, any contact with such surfaces can also spread the virus. Symptoms take between two to 14 days to appear, during which time the carrier is believed to be contagious.Where did the virus come from?The virus was first identified in Wuhan, China in late December. The coronavirus is a large family of viruses that is responsible for everything from the common cold to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). After an initial outbreak in Wuhan that spread across Hubei province, eventually infecting over 80,000 and killing more than 3,000, new infection rates in mainland China have dropped. However, the disease has since spread across the world at an alarming rate.   What is the current status of Covid-19?The World Health Organisation has called the ongoing outbreak a “pandemic” and urged countries across the world to take precautionary measures. Covid-19 has spread to 213 countries and territories around the world and infected more than 31,405,983 people with 967,505 deaths and 22,990,260 recoveries. In South Asia, India has reported the highest number of infections at 5,557,573 with 88,943 deaths. While Pakistan has reported 306,304 confirmed cases with 6,420 deaths. Nepal has so far reported 65,276 cases with 427 deaths.How dangerous is the disease?The mortality rate for Covid-19 is estimated to be 3.6 percent, but new studies have put the rate slightly higher at 5.7 percent. Although Covid-19 is not too dangerous to young healthy people, older individuals and those with immune-compromised systems are at greater risk of death. People with chronic medical conditions like heart disease, diabetes and lung disease, or those who’ve recently undergone serious medical procedures, are also at risk. How do I keep myself safe?The WHO advises that the most important thing you can do is wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizers with at least 60 percent alcohol content. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unclean hands. Clean and disinfect frequently used surfaces like your computers and phones. Avoid large crowds of people. Seek medical attention if symptoms persist for longer than a few days.Is it time to panic?No. The government has imposed a lockdown to limit the spread of the virus. There is no need to begin stockpiling food, cooking gas or hand sanitizers. However, it is always prudent to take sensible precautions like the ones identified above.","Published at : May 19, 2020",Banke,Thakur Singh Tharu
Quarantine facilities in Province 5 crowded and mismanaged,"On May 14, it was announced that six officials from Kapilvastu’s Krishnanagar Municipality—including a non-gazetted first class official at the agriculture department, an office assistant and four security personnel—were infected with coronavirus.While tracing their contacts, it was revealed that one of them, the first class official, had visited his brother, who was placed at the quarantine facility in Mahendra Secondary, almost every day to deliver food. Health officials say there's a high chance that he might have caught the virus during one of his visits.Many locals in Kapilvastu these days visit quarantine centres to take food to their quarantined family members and relatives. “The villagers do not adopt protective measures and bring the utensils used by the quarantined back home,” Hanuman Pandey, a local of Pakarbhitawa in Yashodhara Rural Municipality, said. “And in a close-knit village like ours, direct or indirect contact between individuals is unavoidable.” In Pakarbhitawa, eight people have tested positive for the virus so far.In Yashodhara Rural Municipality alone, there are 25 quarantine facilities that altogether house 1,139 individuals, most of whom are returnees from India. The rural municipality, however, provides food to half of them only, owing to the large number of quarantined individuals, according to Jyoti Prakash Dubey, chief of health bureau at the rural municipality. “We are having difficulties managing food for the increasing number of quarantined individuals, hence we are asking the families of those infected, who live close by, to bring food for them,” Dubey said.If Yashodhara is providing food to half of the quarantined individuals, Mayadevi Rural Municipality has stopped providing food at all. “We provided food until Thursday, but now we can’t bear the cost, as the number of quarantined individuals keeps on rising,” Bajrangi Chaudhary, chief of Mayadevi, said. The local unit currently has 30 quarantine centres with 856 individuals in them.Rajat Pratap Shah, mayor of Krishnanagar Municipality, echoes Chaudhary, saying that as the number keeps climbing, it’s hard for the local unit to bear the cost of food. Krishnanagar has quarantined 939 individuals so far.However, the quarantine facilities get crowded in the morning and evening with family members bringing food, and this is very risky, said Sudarshan Thapa, a physician at the Butwal-based Corona-specific hospital. “If the management of the quarantine facilities is poor, then there’s a risk that the virus will run rampant through the whole community,” Thapa said. “The quarantine centres should be managed like hospitals.”Local units and provincial officials in Province 5 have complained of a lack of coordination from the federal government to manage the quarantine centres.Ram Bahadur Nepali, a public health officer at the provincial Infectious Disease Control Bureau, said that with many Nepalis still stuck at the borders, the risk of the virus’s outbreak has further intensified. “Most of the infected in Province 5 are recent returnees from India,” Nepali said. “And many of those who are quarantined lack basic knowledge on how to prevent the contingent spread of the virus. The quarantine centres are crowded and utterly mismanaged.” While the cases keep on rising, many local units do not have data on the number of possible returnees to pre-plan the setting up of quarantine facilities, which is another reason the facilities are crowded already, Nepali said.According to the Rupandehi District Administration, about 1,000 individuals entered Nepal through the Sunauli border point this week, while nearly 900 are still stranded at the border. The number of those stranded at the border is increasing, but the district administration doesn’t have a record of the potential number of people trying to come to Nepal from India and overseas.“We have asked each local unit to find out the number of people who are still abroad,” Mahadev Pantha, chief district officer of Rupandehi, said. “And those who are stranded at the border will be brought here with proper protective measures.”As cases rise, the province is reeling under a lack of hospital beds and manpower and is scrambling to manage resources. As of Monday, the province has reported 159 cases of Covid-19, with Banke reporting the highest number with 81 cases. According to the Provincial Health Directive, as of Sunday, a total of 14,477 individuals are quarantined in 707 facilities across the province.

"Lack of coordination among federal, provincial and local governments may prove costly in Province 5, say officials","A lack of coordination between the federal, provincial and local government in the fight against Covid-19 could spell a serious crisis in Province 5, some local government officials in Province 5 have warned.Province 5 has so far reported 110 Covid-19 cases but management of quarantine and health facilities in many places remain in a dismal state.In places that lie close to the Nepal-India border, the local governments say they are unable to quarantine and look after the suspected coronavirus patients.“If the provincial and federal governments are not coming to our aid, we may as well shut down the quarantine centres altogether,” said Chandra Bhusan Yada, chief of Kotahimai Rural Municipality in Rupandehi.Baijnath Chaudhary, spokesperson of Province 5 government, however, claims that the provincial government has already deployed all necessary resources to the local governments.Chaudhary said the provincial government has disbursed Rs130.06 million to the local units for coronavirus response and preparedness.The fund was deducted from the ministers’ monthly salary and was collected in the Corona Virus Control and Rescue Fund and District Coordination Committee.According to Chuadhary, the provincial government had provided Rs 1.5 million each to rural municipalities, Rs 2 million to municipalitie and Rs 2.5 million each to sub-metropolitan cities.But many local units say that the funds announced by the provincial government have not reached them. Many of these local units are located close to the Nepal-India border where the risk of coronavirus outbreak is high.“The provincial government is currently in no position to provide additional funds to the local governments,” Chaudhary said.According to the standard plan of action, the local governments are responsible for maintaining the quarantine facilities, the district administration for rescue, the provincial government for hospital management, and the federal government for medical support, like providing test kits and other essential medical equipment.Province 5 has a large number of people who work in India. Many of them have already entered the country while many more are likely to return soon.The local governments are woefully under-equipped and under-resourced to keep these people in quarantine and offer them treatment if necessary.The federal government has not managed the resources required to manage the quarantine and health facilities for a large number of India returnees, Chaudhary said.“If the number of cases keep on rising, the provincial and local governments will have a hard time handling the crisis. It is high time the federal government came up with a plan to avert a potential health disaster.”","Published at : May 18, 2020",Rupandehi,Amrita Anmol
Nepal reports second Covid-19 death,"A day after Nepal reported its first Covid-19-related death, the Health Ministry has confirmed a second fatality from the coronavirus.According to Dr Bikash Devkota, spokesperson for the Health Ministry, a 25-year-old man from Banke who died on Sunday morning tested positive for Covid-19.“The man, who had a fever and was suffering from diarrhea since Saturday night, died on Sunday morning at around 6:40 am in quarantine at Narainapur in Banke,” Devkota said on Sunday at a regular press briefing. “A polymerase chain reaction test performed on nasal and throat swabs from the deceased came back positive for Covid-19.”The man, who came to Nepal on May 12, had been placed in quarantine by the district authorities.On Saturday, the death of a 29-year-old postpartum woman was confirmed to have been due to COvid-19 complications, Nepal’s first fatality due to the coronavirus.As of Sunday, 292 people have tested positive for Covid-19 in the country, with two deaths.  Frequently asked questions about the coronavirus outbreakUPDATED as of September 22, 2020What is Covid-19?Covid-19, short for coronavirus disease, is an illness caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, short for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

"As cases of Covid-19 surge in Province 5, hospitals run out of resources","As Province 5 sees a surge in Covid-19 cases, hospitals here have begun facing a resource crunch.The hospitals in the province designated as Covid-19 treatment centres say they lack medical equipment, medical workers and protective gear as the number of infected in the province reached 105 in the province as of Friday.The hospitals in Butwal, Bhairahawa, Banke, and Dang, where Covid-19 patients are receiving treatment, face a host of challenges dealing with patients diagnosed with the novel disease.Sudarshan Thapa, focal person at Butwal-based Lumbini Hospital, which is administering the Corona-specific hospitals in Rupandehi, said that resources are already spread thin and it can’t take in any more patients. “The hospital needs to recruit about 30 more health workers at the earliest,” said Thapa. As of Thursday, 36 patients are undergoing treatment at the hospital.But it’s not only the beds that the hospital lacks, it also needs PPEs and masks, said Thapa.In Banke, 25 people infected with the disease are currently undergoing treatment at the Sushil Koirala Prakhar Cancer Hospital. While the hospital has 50 beds, only 25 have been allocated for the Covid-19 patients. The hospital has three ventilators and six ICU beds, which are insufficient if patients fall critically ill, said Prakash Thapa, chief of Bheri Regional Hospital, said.In Dang, 21 individuals are currently admitted at the Beljhundi-based corona-specific hospital. A total of 30 beds are ready for use as of now, the hospital says it can increase the capacity if need be, according to hospital administration. Late on Friday, the Ministry of Health and Population confirmed three coronavirus cases in Dang. The Ministry said the patients’ condition is normal and that they are in contact with the health officials. These are the first three coronavirus positive cases in Dang.Similarly, 19 are receiving treatment in Bhairahawa.Meanwhile, the provincial government has said it plans to add more beds to the Butwal-based hospital. A meeting convened by Minister for Industry, Tourism and Environment Lila Giri has decided to add 200 beds at the facility.“The government has decided to add 200 beds and 20 ICUs,” said Surya Bahadur Bhattarai, chair of Lumbini Provincial Hospital Development Committee, which monitors the corona-specific hospital in Butwal. Bhattarai, however, said that while the work has started, it’s uncertain when the additional facilities would be ready. “Two ventilators are ready at the hospital. We are increasing other facilities as well,” said Dr Sarbesh Sharma, secretary of the Hospital Management Committee. Frequently asked questions about the coronavirus outbreakUPDATED as of September 22, 2020What is Covid-19?Covid-19, short for coronavirus disease, is an illness caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, short for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Common symptoms of the disease include fever, dry cough, fatigue, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In severe cases, the infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. How contagious is Covid-19?Covid-19 can spread easily from person to person, especially in enclosed spaces. The virus can travel through the air in respiratory droplets produced when a sick person breathes, talks, coughs or sneezes. As the virus can also survive on plastic and steel surfaces for up to 72 hours and on cardboard for up to 24 hours, any contact with such surfaces can also spread the virus. Symptoms take between two to 14 days to appear, during which time the carrier is believed to be contagious.Where did the virus come from?The virus was first identified in Wuhan, China in late December.

Arghakhanchi seals off its borders from Tuesday until further notice,"The local administration in Arghakhanchi has sealed off the district from Tuesday morning after the neighbouring district of Kapilvastu reported 24 new cases of Covid-19 in two days. Kapilvastu has so far reported 29 cases of coronavirus infection— 16 cases were confirmed on Monday and eight more on Tuesday, making it one of the most affected districts in the country.A sudden surge in coronavirus infection cases in Kapilvastu led the District Security Committee in Arghakhanchi to seal off the district in order to prevent the possible spread of coronavirus. Bishnuraj Belbase, assistant chief district officer of Arghakhanchi, said the district administration has mobilised police personnel in Pattharkot along the Sandhikharka-Gorusinghe road section and other border points to prevent vehicles and people from entering the district from Kapilvastu.The restriction, however, will not apply to the vehicles offering essential services. “Volunteers have also been mobilised to restrict movement from the Shitaganga-Kapilvastu border area,” said Belbase. According to the District Administration Office, Arghakhanchi is at high risk due to the rising number of coronavirus cases in neighbouring Kapilvastu. “It is necessary to seal the district to prevent the spread of the virus. We will have to strictly enforce the lockdown,” said Belbase, adding that they have also stepped up security along Palpa, Gulmi and Pyuthan borders. The federal government has extended the nationwide lockdown to mitigate the risk of the spread of coronavirus until May 18.With the spike in Covid-19 cases, Parsa and Bara districts have also issued prohibitory orders.“A prohibitory order has been issued in the district to prevent further spread of the virus. The order went into effect from 8 pm on Tuesday and will be in place till May 18 midnight,” said Lalit Kumar Basnet, the assistant chief district officer of Parsa.Thrity-nine new cases were reported in Parsa on Tuesday alone, taking the district’s tally to 64, the highest in the country.Similarly, Bara district administration also issued prohibitory orders effective from 6 am on Wednesday until further notice.“Public movement between Bara and Parsa has been prohibited,” said Rudra Prasad Pandit, the chief administrative officer of Bara. “All the vehicle passes that were issued till date will also be suspended except for medical emergencies.”Bara has reported three Covid-19 cases so far.(Laxmi Sah and Bhusan Yadav contributed reporting from Bara and Parsa)","Published at : May 12, 2020",Arghakhanchi,Birendra KC

Hundreds of Nepalis stranded at Nepal-India borders as federal government has yet to respond,"A month and a half since the Nepal-India border was closed, the border points are still crowded with Nepalis seeking to enter their native country every day.Confusion looms large among the district authorities that border with India for the federal government has not formulated any policy to deal with the returnees still locked outside the country. Some Nepalis are stranded at the border points while there are many more who have completed their time in quarantine facilities in India waiting to return home. The government has yet to make a decision about just what to do with them.“We are having a hard time trying to manage the crowd. We can’t do anything until higher authorities instruct us what to do,” a security officer in Rupandehi said on conditions of anonymity. “Meanwhile, the Indian authorities are mounting pressure on us to let in the quarantined Nepalis back.”Both Nepal and India have been under a nationwide lockdown for over a month-and-a half now in response to the spread of Covid-19. Two weeks ago, the Nepal government had allowed entry to 300 Nepalis who had completed the three-week quarantine period in Nautanwa, India.But the crowd at the border of Belahiya has not subsided. According to Ishwari Adhikari, a police inspector at the Belahiya-based Area Police Office, there are over a 1,000 Nepalis across the border who want to come to Nepal. “Many people show up at the border every day seeking entry to Nepal, but for a lack of government order, we don’t know what to do with them. We return them to India in coordination with the Indian Police,” Adhikari said, adding that on Thursday alone, 106 Nepalis were returned to the Indian side of the border.Nearly a half of all those stranded in the border have already completed their quarantine period in Nautanwa, Adhikari said. The Indian authorities have requested their Nepali counterparts in the border to take back the Nepali nationals who have completed their time in quarantine. Many of the stranded Nepalis came walking to the border from various parts of India, while some were provided with transportation facilities by the Indian authorities, Adhikari said.The lack of a government decision has raised the risk of people entering Nepal through proxy routes across the porous open border.Meanwhile, in Kapilvastu, local units have sheltered a total of 896 people who entered Nepal to escape the rain and storm on Thursday. They are sheltered in various schools and health posts near the no-man’s land in the district.Dirgha Narayan Poudel, chief district officer of Kapilvastu, said that while the people are currently sheltered by the local units, they can’t be let inside Nepal until the federal government takes a decision. “We have informed the Home Ministry about the situation,” he said. “We will have to shelter them until we are instructed on what to do.” In West Nawalparasi, where four local units share borders with India, there’s a reported rise in the number of people in quarantine facilities, as people have been using proxy routes to enter Nepal. “Those who enter Nepal through porous border points are quarantined,” Radhe Shyam Chaudhary, chief of Sarawal Rural Municipality, said. According to Chaudhary, the number of quarantined individuals in the district increased from 142 to 193 this week.Dhruba Nepal, administrative officer at the Rupandehi District Administration Office, said his office has repeatedly informed higher authorities about the situation but hasn’t received anything in response yet.“We can’t do anything unless we receive a decision from the upper echelons of the government,” Nepal said.(Manoj Poudel in Kapilvastu and Nabeen Paudel in West Nawalparasi contributed reporting.)","Published at : May 9, 2020",Rupandehi,Madhav Dhungana
Hundreds of homebound Nepalis stranded in no-man’s-land in Kapilvastu,"As many as 343 homebound Nepalis had reached the no-man’s land along the Nepal-India border in Kapilvastu by Wednesday afternoon, but they were denied entry into the country. Security personnel of the Armed Police Force stopped the Nepalis from crossing the border, as the country is currently under lockdown to prevent the outbreak of Covid-19.“It’s been more than 40 days since the lockdown and we had difficulties managing food and shelter in India. So we were compelled to return home,” said Dinesh Bhar, a resident of Kapilvastu. According to him, it took him seven days to reach the border from Mumbai in Maharashtra, India. “I walked and hitchhiked to the no-man’s land,” he said.The returnees say they have been staying at the no-man’s land without food and water since they were stopped from entering the country.“We decided to come home rather than starve in a foreign land. But the police stopped us at the border,” said Buddiram Raidas of Kapilvastu.A total of 155 people spent the night in the border area on Tuesday, and they were joined by 188 others on Wednesday. Ninety-eight people are staying in the no-man’s-land in Maryadapur, 81 in Chakalchauda, 62 in Hardauna, 48 in Krishnanahar, 46 in Bhilmi, seven in Hathihawa and one in Bijayanagar.Local units and some individuals, in coordination with the security personnel deployed at the border, provided tents and food to those stranded. Meanwhile, the local administration said it was out of their jurisdiction to take a decision on whether to allow the returnees to enter Nepal or not. “The federal Ministry of Home Affairs instructed us not to let anyone cross the border. We are following the ministry's order,” said Dirgha Narayan Paudel, the chief district officer of Kapilvastu. According to him, efforts are underway to keep the stranded Nepalese in quarantine in India. “We are coordinating with the administration of Siddharthnagar in India,” he added.Following the government’s decision, the Armed Police Force has sealed the 93-km-long Nepal-India border in Kapilvastu to prevent people from crossing the border. The Cabinet meeting held on Wednesday has decided to extend the nationwide lockdown until May 18 and to continue closing all border points until May 31.However, in Rupandehi, many people are still found crossing into Nepal through porous border points at night. People’s representatives in the district complained that Sammarimai, Mayadevi and Kotahimai rural municipalities, which border with India, are at high risk of coronavirus outbreak, as people are still crossing into Nepal through these border areas.Netra Prasad Ghimire, chief administrative officer at Kotahimai, said the entry of people from India is still going unchecked. “People are crossing streams and walking through forests to avoid security. Some of them come to our contact while many entrants are not traced,” said Ghimire.According to APF Inspector Anil Thapa, a total of 75 security personnel are deployed in the border outpost in Marchawar, but security in the forest areas is lax at night.","Published at : May 8, 2020",Kapilvastu/rupandehi,Manoj Paudel						 &
Rukum East locals using their vocational skills while in quarantine facilities,"It’s been 12 days since Dharma Kumari BK moved to a quarantine facility in Bhume Rural Municipality. Dharma, a resident of Bhume in Rukum (East), has been keeping busy knitting woollen sweaters and caps from sheep wool. “I have to stay in quarantine for at least 14 days. To pass time, I asked my family to send me some wool so I could start knitting,” she said. Bhakta BK and Rakshya BK, who are staying at the same quarantine facility, have also been making use of their time in quarantine by making various bamboo products, including bamboo baskets. Like Dharma, Bhakta and Rakshya, most of the individuals staying at the quarantine facility in Bhume are making use of their vocational skills to pass their days.“We have been making bamboo baskets and other bamboo items while staying in quarantine. These items can be used in our house or we can sell them in the local markets when the lockdown is lifted,” Bhakta said. The quarantine facility in Bhume currently houses 30 individuals, including 14 women, who are making use of their time in quarantine honing their vocational skills such as knitting and weaving. Some of the individuals whose farmlands are near the quarantine facility are also working in their fields during the day. “We are helping our family members harvest wheat and barley. We work in our farmlands during the day while maintaining ‘physical distancing’ but we spend our night at the quarantine facility,” said Manmati Pun Magar, another occupant of the facility.“Twenty individuals from Dang, six from Pokhara and four from Baglung arrived at this facility during the lockdown,” said Gyanu Pun Magar, one of the quarantined at the Bhume-based facility.In Bhume Rural Municipality, there are 54 individuals staying in various quarantine facilities, whereas 310 individuals have been advised to stay in self-quarantine by the authorities. Ramsur Budha Magar, chairperson of the rural municipality, said the local administration has allowed individuals to work and study while in quarantine. “It’s mandatory for all those who arrive from other districts or abroad to stay in quarantine. We have told them to utilise their time while staying in the quarantine facility,” Magar said. Over 300 individuals have arrived in Bhume from Kathmandu and other parts of the country in recent months.","Published at : May 7, 2020",Rukum,Hari Gautam
Province 5 to expand the capacity of healthcare facilities given the growing number of coronavirus cases,"The Province 5 government has decided to use its police and army hospitals for the treatment of Covid-19. A meeting of the Crisis Management Centre, headed by Chief Minister Shankar Pokharel, took the decision to that effect on Wednesday, citing the need to expand the capacity of healthcare facilities since a total of 23 individuals have tested positive for the novel coronavirus in Banke.All the infected patients are currently undergoing treatment at the Khajura-based Sushil Koirala Prakhar Cancer Hospital, which has been remodelled as ‘corona-specific hospital’. The hospital has a capacity of 40 beds, but since the health workers involved in the treatment of Covid-19 patients also live in the hospital, there are only two beds left for patients, according to the District Public Health Office.Physicians have warned that the number of infected patients could go up in the coming days, as those who have tested positive were found to have had social interaction before they were tested.Medical Superintendent of Bheri Provincial Hospital Prakash Thapa, who has been involved in the treatment of patients at the corona-specific hospital, said there’s no shortfall of health workers as of now, as the hospital has been coordinating with other medical institutions. “But if the number of patients goes up, we might face problems in treating the patients,” he said. Moreover, the hospital administration has also expressed concerns over the availability of protective gears. The hospital currently has 160 units of PPE, 270 units of PCR kits, and 500 N95 masks, according to Thapa. Besides the corona-specific hospital, the district administration office also plans to use a private hospital for treating Covid-19 patients if more cases are reported.The meeting of the Crisis Management Committee on Wednesday discussed the availability of resources to deal with the crisis, said Sudarshan Baral, provincial minister of Social Development. “Contact tracing is currently going on,” he said. “We will analyse the situation once we complete tracing the contact of all infected patients. We will then have an idea of whether the resources we have will suffice.” Three districts in the province—Banke, Rupandehi and Kapilvastu—will collectively set up 3,000 bed-strong quarantine facilities for those who have and may return from India, according to Sher Bahadur KC, press advisor to the chief minister.As of now, the province has sufficient protective gears with 2,000 PPEs and 776 gowns, according to Dinesh Chapagain, director of the Supply Department of the Social Development Ministry.A total of 5,000 individuals have been tested for the virus in the province so far, according to Binod Giri, director of the Provincial Public Health Office. “We have sufficient resources for now,” Giri said. “Four hospitals were recently set up to treat Covid-19 patients and contact tracing is being intensified.”","Published at : May 7, 2020",Rupendehi,Ghanashyam Gautam
Authorities in Nepalgunj focus on contact tracing after 15 positive cases for Covid-19 were confirmed on Sunday,"With 16 positive cases of Covid-19 in Nepalgunj Sub-metropolis of Banke district, authorities are focusing on contact tracing to control the spread of the virus. However, the District Public Health Office in Banke has been struggling to find the travel history of the infected people and trace hundreds of people they came in contact with.“Efforts are on to ‘contact trace’ those who came in contact with the infected people. Nepalgunj has become a hot spot for coronavirus since a large number of positive cases were confirmed in a single day,” said Naresh Shrestha, the focal point person at the health office. “We collected the swabs of 90 people after Covid-19 was confirmed in a man on Friday. We are contact tracing those who came in contact with the infected people.” According to him, more than 300 people should be traced immediately to control the spread of the disease.The infected people are being kept in an isolation ward at Sushil Koirala Prakhar Cancer Hospital in Khajura. Government officials and security personnel have interviewed the infected people to trace those who came into their contact. According to the District Public Health Office, more than 300 people have been traced based on the information provided by the infected persons.A 60-year-old man of Nepalgunj who had returned from India a month ago tested positive for Covid-19 on Friday. Authorities were alarmed as the man was out in public and even visited three neighbourhood homes. Health officials on Saturday collected the throat swabs of 90 people who came in contact with the infected man. The lab tests conducted in Bheri Hospital confirmed 15 positive cases on Sunday.Health officials say that the virus has entered the third phase, which is the community transmission phase, in Nepalgunj. “The federal health ministry is the authority responsible for determining the phase of the coronavirus infection in Nepal. But we suspect community transmission of the disease in Nepalgunj,” said Dr Rajan Pandey, the chief consultant physician at Bheri Hospital.The area in Nepalgunj where the positive cases were confirmed is a dense human settlement. Health officials suspect that the number of positive cases might go up, as the settlement’s residents were found to be visiting one another’s houses even during the lockdown.Health officials at Bheri Hospital have underscored the importance of mass testing in Nepalgunj. Swabs of 93 people were collected on Sunday; among them 54 tested negative for the disease while the report of 39 samples is yet to come. Dr Prakash Thapa, chief at Bheri Hospital, argued that the number of positive cases of coronavirus shot up due to the delay in mass testing. “At this stage, there is no alternative but to conduct mass testing in the community,” he added.The Khajura-based cancer hospital where the infected people were admitted has a 40-bed isolation ward, six ICU beds and three ventilators. “We don’t have a shortage of human resources now. We have a team of 12 health workers, including two doctors, to provide treatment to the infected people. But we could fall short if the cases keep on rising,” said Thapa.The provincial minister for Social Development Sudarshan Baral reached Nepalgunj on Monday and held discussions with health officials, local administrations and security personnel regarding the treatment of Covid-19 patients and extending health facilities if the numbers keep on rising.Meanwhile, the local administration on Monday issued a prohibitory order in Nepalgunj with effect from Tuesday to control the possible spread of coronavirus. Chief District Officer of Banke Kumar Bahadur Khadka said the local administration has sealed four settlements in Nepalgunj and has strictly enforced the lockdown as more cases are getting reported.“We have asked the federal government to send additional rapid diagnostic test kits and equipment for mass testing” he added.With the increasing number of Covid-19 cases in Banke, neighbouring districts of Bardiya, Dang and even the districts of Karnali Province are on high alert for a possible outbreak of coronavirus. A large number of people from these districts passed through Nepalgunj to return home, mainly from India, in the last two months.  Frequently asked questions about the coronavirus outbreakUPDATED as of September 22, 2020What is Covid-19?Covid-19, short for coronavirus disease, is an illness caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, short for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Common symptoms of the disease include fever, dry cough, fatigue, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In severe cases, the infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. How contagious is Covid-19?Covid-19 can spread easily from person to person, especially in enclosed spaces. The virus can travel through the air in respiratory droplets produced when a sick person breathes, talks, coughs or sneezes. As the virus can also survive on plastic and steel surfaces for up to 72 hours and on cardboard for up to 24 hours, any contact with such surfaces can also spread the virus. Symptoms take between two to 14 days to appear, during which time the carrier is believed to be contagious.Where did the virus come from?The virus was first identified in Wuhan, China in late December. The coronavirus is a large family of viruses that is responsible for everything from the common cold to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). After an initial outbreak in Wuhan that spread across Hubei province, eventually infecting over 80,000 and killing more than 3,000, new infection rates in mainland China have dropped. However, the disease has since spread across the world at an alarming rate.   What is the current status of Covid-19?The World Health Organisation has called the ongoing outbreak a “pandemic” and urged countries across the world to take precautionary measures. Covid-19 has spread to 213 countries and territories around the world and infected more than 31,405,983 people with 967,505 deaths and 22,990,260 recoveries. In South Asia, India has reported the highest number of infections at 5,557,573 with 88,943 deaths. While Pakistan has reported 306,304 confirmed cases with 6,420 deaths. Nepal has so far reported 65,276 cases with 427 deaths.How dangerous is the disease?The mortality rate for Covid-19 is estimated to be 3.6 percent, but new studies have put the rate slightly higher at 5.7 percent. Although Covid-19 is not too dangerous to young healthy people, older individuals and those with immune-compromised systems are at greater risk of death. People with chronic medical conditions like heart disease, diabetes and lung disease, or those who’ve recently undergone serious medical procedures, are also at risk. How do I keep myself safe?The WHO advises that the most important thing you can do is wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizers with at least 60 percent alcohol content. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unclean hands. Clean and disinfect frequently used surfaces like your computers and phones. Avoid large crowds of people. Seek medical attention if symptoms persist for longer than a few days.Is it time to panic?No. The government has imposed a lockdown to limit the spread of the virus. There is no need to begin stockpiling food, cooking gas or hand sanitizers. However, it is always prudent to take sensible precautions like the ones identified above.","Published at : May 5, 2020",Nepalgunj,Thakur Singh Tharu						 &
Dang’s health workers lack proper medical gears to tackle Covid-19,"On March 20, a man who had recently returned from India was admitted to Rapti Health and Science Academy on suspicion of Covid-19. Health workers at the hospital were alarmed as they had never been involved in the treatment of Covid-19 patients before. Soon, the number of suspected Covid-19 cases at the hospital rose to five.Prakriti DC, a nurse employed at the medical ward in the hospital, was deployed to care for these patients. DC knew she had to wear PPE to secure herself and asked the hospital administration to provide the suit. But Dr Basanta Lamichhane, dean at the hospital, told her that PPEs were not necessary at the moment. “I hadn’t asked for a PPE while looking after other patients, but taking care of suspicious cases required me to use PPE to protect myself from contracting the disease and spreading it further,” DC said. “The dean said PPE shall be used only when there's a crisis situation and that at the moment we should make do with aprons and masks.”A few days later, DC sent out a Facebook story stating that for health workers like her, looking after patients suspected of Covid-19 without PPE is akin to soldiers going to war without any weapon. “This is how things are in our Academy,” she wrote.Soon, the hospital administration fired her, taking issue with her social media post. She was relieved of her job on April 13. “I was fired just because I complained about the lack of PPE,” DC told the Post. “I raised the issue for the security of health workers who are on the frontline in the battle against Covid-19. But the hospital administration discouraged everyone who speaks for our security.”Dr Amrita Shrestha, who works at the hospital’s emergency ward, was also fired because she also posted about the lack of protective equipment on Facebook. “When the administration didn’t take heed of my concern, I resorted using a public platform, and I was fired for doing that,” Shrestha said. Even today, many health workers in Dang who are involved in the treatment of Covid-19 patients or suspects are without protective equipment and are at risk of catching the virus. “Health workers should have been encouraged at a time like this, but instead we are being thrown under the bus,” Shrestha said. “This is discouraging for all health workers.” WHO has recommended not to use PPEs until they’re necessary to minimise the risk of shortage, and hospital administrations are misinterpreting this recommendation to deny the protective equipment to even the physicians and nurses, health workers say. Meanwhile, Vice Chancellor of Rapti Health and Science Academy Dr Sangeeta Bhandari said PPEs are provided to health workers whenever necessary. “Even the senior doctors among us are using only masks while doing our rounds to check on patients,” she said. “PPEs should not be misused and we have provided the equipment to those who absolutely need it.” Bhandari said posting on social media about PPE shortage at the hospital was unacceptable. “It is not becoming of health workers to demand PPEs even when it’s necessary, and taking to social media to publicise it,” she said. “The Academy has five PPEs at the ready and they can be used when necessary. But it’s not a good practice to take to social media to post about PPEs.”She, however, denied that DC and Shrestha were fired for their social media posts.They were relieved of their duty after their contracts were over, she claimed.In another incident, the Dang District Court held an online hearing in a timber smuggling case after the defendants could not undergo medical tests as the staff at District Health Office refused to test them citing lack of medical equipment including PPEs.“The court had demanded coronavirus test reports of the defendants to proceed with the hearing. But we could not get the defendants tested at the District Health Office,” Deepak Gyawali, chief of Sunpur Forest Sub-division Office, said.Sunita Poudel, chief of the health office, said the facility did not have PPE to test suspected Covid-19 patients.“We require WHO-certified PPEs to test and treat the patients. We haven’t had any cases so far. But once the cases start to emerge, we may not be ready to do our jobs without proper protective gear,” Poudel said. Dhundiraj Poudel, a senior physician, said that every health worker dealing with a COvid-19 patient or a suspected patient should be provided with a reliable PPE.“Many health workers around the world have been infected with the viral disease due to a lack of proper security measures, and that can happen here too,” Poudel said. “If the health workers themselves get infected, then that would be a very dangerous situation, so everyone should be committed to providing security to health workers.”","Published at : May 4, 2020",Dang,Durgalal KC
Locals in Bardiya rush to the market fearing shortage of daily essentials,"The local administration in Bardiya has stipulated a few hours in the day for shops to open for business. Shops selling daily essentials remain open for a couple of hours and locals are seen in long queues to buy food grains, cooking oil and salt, among other goods. At Radhakrishna Tharu Chowk in Gulariya Municipality, shops open between 10am and 2pm every day under a strict supervision of security personnel. For the locals, there is no other option but to stand outside the shops to get a chance to buy essentials.Santosh Chaudhary, who was waiting in a queue outside a shop in Radhakrishna Chowk on Tuesday, said, “I have been standing here since 11am to purchase flour, salt and other food items. It’s almost 1pm now but I’ll have to wait another hour for my turn.”Locals of Gulariya have started to rush to the market fearing a shortage of daily essentials, adding to the long queues outside shops every day. According to local businessmen, daily imports have fallen due to the lockdown which has affected the supply chain.“If more shops were open, the crowd outside shops would be thin,” said Suresh Yadav, another consumer in Radhakrishna Chowk. But given the limited supply, only a few shops remain open in the bazaar area.The Bardiya administration said they have allowed shops to open during the stipulated hours but most shops have chosen to stay closed. Ganesh Bikram Shah, the administrative officer at the District Administration Office in Bardiya, said the administration has requested businessmen to open shops to sell daily essentials including food grains, cooking gas and vegetable oil. “But many shops have not opened. We don’t know why.” The District Administration Office said most retail shops are closed due to the lack of food grains and other daily essentials at the wholesalers’. Shah said, “We don’t want a shortage of daily essentials in the district. So we have allowed imports of food grains and other essentials from other districts. We have also encouraged businessmen to import more foodstuffs and other daily essentials for the benefit of the locals.” Bir Bahadur Chaudhary, chairman of the Bardiya Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said more than a half dozen shops selling food grains and other daily essentials open every day.“We are ready to open more shops if necessary. But, if we do that, there is no point of the lockdown. That’s why only a few shops are being operated at the moment,” said Chaudhary.","Published at : May 2, 2020",Bardiya,Thakur Singh Tharu
Three injured in a clash between APF personnel and locals in Nawalparasi,"Three people, including two minors, were left injured when a team of Armed Police Force personnel resorted to force in the name of enforcing the lockdown at Palhiandhan Bhagatpur in Nawalparasi (West) on Wednesday night. Akhilesh Goud, 10, Munna Goud, 14, and Purnabasi Goud, 65, were injured when the APF personnel hit them with batons for flouting the lockdown orders, locals said.“The APF personnel started shouting and swinging their batons on a man who was heading to a neighbour’s home to get a mosquito net,” said Surendra Goud, a local man. He claimed that the APF men then entered the victims’ homes and hit them with their batons.The injured are currently undergoing treatment at Parasi-based Prithvi Chandra Hospital. The locals have demanded action against the officers involved in the incident.The APF, meanwhile, has presented a different version of the event. Bharat Khaniya, superintendent at the 26th Battalion of the Armed Police Force, said the APF team was in the area after receiving a tipoff regarding alcohol smuggling and it was the locals who attacked the security personnel. “We had to retaliate when the locals started attacking. Some locals might have sustained injuries in the ensuing melee,” Khaniya said.","Published at : May 1, 2020",Nawalparasi,Nabin Paudel

"In Province 5, sexual harassment and domestic abuse cases are getting more severe","On March 25, a 14-year-old girl from Kanchan Rural Municipality was allegedly raped by two men who are currently in police custody. On April 11, a 15-year-old from Gaidahawa Rural Municipality was raped by her own father. In the latter case, the family members tried to stop the victim from filing a police case. But three days later, the incident was publicised and the police on Friday arrested the alleged perpetrator who was on the run.In Province 5, despite the nationwide lockdown imposed by the government to control the spread of Covid-19, incidents of rape have not stopped. In the eight districts of Province 5, 20 women have been raped in the 26 days that the country has been under lockdown.“Incidents of rape in the province have not stopped during the lockdown,” DSP Nawaraj Pokharel of the provincial police said. Rupandehi has reported the most number of rapes, with six cases in the past 26 days. Six rape cases were reported in Kapilvastu; three in Banke, two in Rolpa and Gulmi each; and one case each in Bardiya, Pyuthan and Nawalparasi.Between mid-February and mid-March, the province recorded 35 incidents of rape. “The lockdown has led to a slight decrease in the number of rape cases reported, but when nobody is out of home, we’ve found that it’s the victims’ own family members and relatives who are perpetrating the crime,” Pokharel said.Sociologist Balbahadur Pandey said that when people can’t get out of their homes during the lockdown, they are more prone to getting negative thoughts. “People tend to commit crimes when they can’t handle the thoughts germinating in their minds,” he said, adding that internet pornography is also responsible for sexual crimes. “Crises like wars and earthquakes tend to see an increase in the number of domestic abuse cases.” Reema BC, a women’s rights activist, said she is surprised that violence against women has become worse during the lockdown. “We have found the nature of the abuses is more severe in lockdown than in normal times,” she said, adding that she receives multiple phone calls a day from women seeking help. “Since there’s little contact with people outside homes, perpetrators tend to think that the crime would go unnoticed,” she said. DSP Pokharel said that a large number of sexual harassment cases in the province still go unreported in the district. “When people from one’s own family commit a crime, women, especially underage girls, don’t report them,” he said, adding that not reporting a crime only emboldens the perpetrator.According to Pokharel, apart from cases of sexual harassment, 11 women have reported domestic abuse in the period of the lockdown. In the meantime, 30 people have committed suicide during this period, according to Pokharel.","Published at : April 29, 2020",Rupandehi,Sanju Paudel
Dang’s health workers struggle to find accommodation to self-quarantine,"On Wednesday, Dr Sarbesh Sharma of a corona-specific hospital in Beljhundi wrote a Facebook status requesting a lodging facility for a team of health workers he leads.“Respected hotel entrepreneurs, social workers, political representatives, administrative authorities and friends from the media,” Sharma, who is the member secretary at the corona-specific hospital, wrote, “We appeal to you to help manage a hotel for us to quarantine ourselves at. We are not untouchables. We are compelled to touch you to save your lives.”Health workers working day in and day out at the temporary hospital have struggled to find a place to live in Dang. According to Sharma, health workers are currently staying at the hospital premises and are taking turns to go home once a week since there have been no positive cases so far. “But if there’s a positive case, we can’t go home as we may get infected ourselves and in turn infect our family members too,” Sharma told the Post. “What do we do in that case? There are no hotels nearby. So it’s time we think about it.”Sharma said that health workers at the frontline of the fight against Covid-19 should be provided with isolated lodging. In Beljhundi, however, there are no hotels. The nearest hotels are in Tulsipur, seven kilometres away, and in Ghorahi, which is 16km away from Beljhundi.The lodging facilities inside the hospital have been suboptimal, Sharma said. “We need somewhere decent to stay and there should be a team that manages food for us,” he said, adding that currently the health workers are cooking food for themselves. As of now, 45 health workers are deployed at the hospital, while the hospital administration has urged other doctors at the Tulsipur Zonal Hospital and health workers at the local units to prepare themselves to fight Covid-19. The temporary hospital has a capacity of 100 beds, of which 20 are currently occupied. Previously, 64 individuals were isolated at the hospital, all of whom have returned home after testing negative for the novel coronavirus.Govinda Prasad Rijal, chief district officer and coordinator of the corona-specific hospital, said, “As of now, the health workers are living on the hospital premises, as the condition is not dire. If the number of Covid-19 patients increases, we will manage isolated lodging and food for them. We are discussing to find a viable solution. We won’t put the health workers in any kind of trouble.”","Published at : April 27, 2020",Dang,Durgalal KC
Hundreds of Nepalis quarantined in India come home via Sunauli and Krishnanagar,"More than 400 Nepali and Indian nationals who were kept in quarantine facilities returned to their respective countries through the Bhairahawa-Sunauli border point in Rupandehi and the Krishnanagar border point in Kapilvastu on Friday and Saturday.As per the bilateral agreement of both the countries, the homebound Nepalis were quarantined in Indian territory while Indian nationals on their way home were kept in quarantine facilities in Nepal for the past three weeks. Authorities of both the nations allowed their citizens to return amid tight security and due health check ups.“One hundred Nepali nationals quarantined in Nautanwa of India entered Nepal through the Sunauli border point on Friday evening and 196 Nepalis crossed the border on Saturday,” said Khadka Bahadur Khatri, the deputy superintendent of police in Rupandehi. According to him, most of the people returning home are from Arghakhanchi and Gulmi districts.The authorities in Nepal coordinated with the respective local units to manage transportation for the people returning home. Balkrishna Acharya, mayor of Malarani Municipality in Arghakhanchi, reached Bhairahawa with three buses on Saturday morning to take the people home. As many as 34 people were transported to Malarani on Friday evening as well. “The returnees will be kept in quarantine and will be tested for Covid-19,” said Acharya.Similarly, 52 Indian nationals who were kept in a quarantine facility near Dandapul in Rupandehi also returned homes. Government officials and people’s representatives of bordering Indian towns welcomed them at the border. The Indian side said its citizens would be kept in quarantine for two weeks before being allowed to go home.In Kapilvastu, 35 Nepali nationals entered the country through the Krishnanagar border point on Saturday. Rajat Pratap Sah, mayor of Krishnanagar Municipality, welcomed the homebound Nepalis at the border point. Rapid diagnostic tests were conducted on all those who entered Nepal.“The results of all 35 people came out negative. We will send them home after coordinating with the respective local bodies,” said Sah, adding that the people entering Nepal on Saturday are from Rupandehi, Kapilvastu, Dang and Jhapa districts.Likewise, Indian authorities also welcomed 36 Indian nationals who were kept in quarantine in Nepal. They had come to take a holy bath in Tribeni of Nawalparasi when they got stranded due to border seals.  Frequently asked questions about the coronavirus outbreakUPDATED as of September 22, 2020What is Covid-19?Covid-19, short for coronavirus disease, is an illness caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, short for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Common symptoms of the disease include fever, dry cough, fatigue, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In severe cases, the infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. How contagious is Covid-19?Covid-19 can spread easily from person to person, especially in enclosed spaces. The virus can travel through the air in respiratory droplets produced when a sick person breathes, talks, coughs or sneezes. As the virus can also survive on plastic and steel surfaces for up to 72 hours and on cardboard for up to 24 hours, any contact with such surfaces can also spread the virus. Symptoms take between two to 14 days to appear, during which time the carrier is believed to be contagious.Where did the virus come from?The virus was first identified in Wuhan, China in late December. The coronavirus is a large family of viruses that is responsible for everything from the common cold to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). After an initial outbreak in Wuhan that spread across Hubei province, eventually infecting over 80,000 and killing more than 3,000, new infection rates in mainland China have dropped. However, the disease has since spread across the world at an alarming rate.   What is the current status of Covid-19?The World Health Organisation has called the ongoing outbreak a “pandemic” and urged countries across the world to take precautionary measures. Covid-19 has spread to 213 countries and territories around the world and infected more than 31,405,983 people with 967,505 deaths and 22,990,260 recoveries. In South Asia, India has reported the highest number of infections at 5,557,573 with 88,943 deaths. While Pakistan has reported 306,304 confirmed cases with 6,420 deaths. Nepal has so far reported 65,276 cases with 427 deaths.How dangerous is the disease?The mortality rate for Covid-19 is estimated to be 3.6 percent, but new studies have put the rate slightly higher at 5.7 percent. Although Covid-19 is not too dangerous to young healthy people, older individuals and those with immune-compromised systems are at greater risk of death. People with chronic medical conditions like heart disease, diabetes and lung disease, or those who’ve recently undergone serious medical procedures, are also at risk. How do I keep myself safe?The WHO advises that the most important thing you can do is wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizers with at least 60 percent alcohol content. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unclean hands. Clean and disinfect frequently used surfaces like your computers and phones. Avoid large crowds of people. Seek medical attention if symptoms persist for longer than a few days.Is it time to panic?No. The government has imposed a lockdown to limit the spread of the virus. There is no need to begin stockpiling food, cooking gas or hand sanitizers. However, it is always prudent to take sensible precautions like the ones identified above.","Published at : April 26, 2020",Rupandehi/kapilvastu,Madhav Dhungana						 &
Lockdown measures gradually loosen up in Province 5 with no Covid-19 positive case detected so far,"As of Friday, Province 5 has tested over 3,000 individuals for Covid-19 and has reported no positive cases. Out of the 3,000 tests, 2,874 were done with rapid diagnostic testing kits and 298 via Polymerase Chain Reaction method. The province has yet to test about 6,500 individuals currently quarantined across its districts.As the province has not reported any positive cases, authorities are gradually loosening the lockdown. Five days ago, Butwal Sub Metropolitan City had decided to allow grocery stores, vegetable and fruit stalls and medical clinics, among others, to open from 8am to 5pm. Many people who arrived in Butwal this week were also sent to their native villages by Rupandehi’s local units, albeit without proper testing. This has led Butwal locals to worry about the spread of the viral disease and question the sub-metropolis’ monitoring. “There are more people on the streets these days,” Durgadutta Ghimire, a local of Kalikanagar, said. “At this rate, we are afraid that there might be an outbreak of the disease. Social-distancing rings in front of shops have wiped out, even though the crowd gathering outside has swelled.”Moreover, the sub-metropolis has not monitored the vehicles carrying daily essentials from India. The vehicle drivers and their helpers are allowed into the country after a simple temperature test.“Local units and security authorities should pay attention to regulate the movement of people and be extra cautious in the border area, as the risk of the disease’s spread is still high,” said Binod Kumar Giri, health director of Province 5. “We have failed to maintain enough precautions.”The situation is similar in Nepalgunj and Kohalpur, two other cities in Province 5 with a high density of population. In Nepalgunj, essential shops are allowed to open from 6am to 3pm while social-distancing regulations have been relaxed.Meanwhile, in Dang, Tulsipur sub-metropolis has allowed essential shops to open for only three days a week in the morning, according to Mayor Ghanashyam Pandey. “The risk has barely subsided,” Pandey said. “So we are still adopting strict measures.”Even though the province has reported no cases so far, the risk is still high given many districts in the province share borders with India, said Sudarshan Baral, the province minister of social development. The province has set up four corona-specific hospitals and three labs to fight the disease. “We are in no way relaxing the lockdown as the risk still runs high,” he said. Acting Police Chief of the province Naresh KC echoed Baral, saying the lockdown is still in place. “We are punishing those who defy the lockdown and urge everyone to stay inside their homes, as the risk is still high,” he said.","Published at : April 25, 2020",Rupandehi,Ghanashyam Gautam
Quality control office verifies foodstuff distributed as relief in Ramgram were of substandard quality,"A week after the residents of Ramgram Municipality returned foodstuff distributed as relief to the municipal office for its substandard quality, the Food Technology and Quality Control Office, Bhairahawa, has verified the locals’ claims.Chief of the quality control office, Bimal Kumar Dahal, said the food material distributed as relief lacked the level of quality approved by the government.The Ramgram municipal office had distributed foodstuff worth about Rs1million to the needy in various wards amid the coronavirus lockdown.After the recipients returned the substandard foodstuffs to the municipal office in protest, the District Administration Office of Nawalparasi (West) had formed a five-member task force to investigate the issue.Sagar Gautam, who led the task force, said they had sampled 20 sacks of foodstuffs and found them to be of inferior quality. The task force had sent the samples to the Bhairahawa-based quality control office for further investigation.Gautam added that the relief materials did not just lack in quality but their quantity was also reduced during distribution. Each sack fell short of about 80 to 180 grams in content against what was mentioned on the label, according to Gautam.“We found there were serious irregularities in the quality and weight. The municipal office will be sued of this,” he said.The Food Technology and Quality Control Office and Bureau of Standards and Metrology will separately launch cases against the municipal office, according to Gautam.The quality control office is expected to file a case against the municipal office by Tuesday, according to chief Bimal Kumar Dahal. “The case will be filed against those involved in the purchase process,” he said.According to existing laws, those involved in distributing substandard food items will be either sentenced to jail for three years or fined Rs50,000, or be liable to both. Ramgram Municipality had purchased a total of 250 quintals of rice from the Parasi-based Rajesh Rice Mill at the cost of Rs1million. The municipal office had distributed the foodstuffs to about 2,300 households in wards 6, 2, and 11.","Published at : April 22, 2020",Nawalparasi (west),Narayan Sharma
Bardiya’s poor are starving while the local unit has been slow to distribute relief,"On Friday, 30-year-old Sushila Pasi, a roadside food vendor, went to the office of ward number 6 in Gulariya Municipality to seek help. With the nationwide lockdown in place for nearly a month to control the spread of Covid-19, Pasi’s business has come to a halt. She had not eaten anything for the past two days and had fed her one-and-a-half-years-old toddler food that was provided by her neighbours. Her husband, who is in Mihipuruwa of India for work, has yet to return.Once at the office, Pasi, a mother of four, couldn’t contain herself and broke down. The elected representatives at the office consoled her and gave her rations that would last her for a few days.“We have not had enough to eat since the lockdown began,” she said. “The neighbours helped us for a few days but we couldn’t always ask them for food.”According to data by the ward office, around 200 daily wage earners in the ward have been severely affected by the lockdown. Sudhamshu Sharma, the ward chair, said those people are struggling to subsist while the municipality has been late to distribute relief material.The municipality had asked for a written letter from relief expectants. But the number of those asking for relief exceeded the municipality’s estimation. Mayor Muktinath Yadav said on close inspection, the local unit found that many of those who are well-off have also filed letters asking for relief. “We have launched an investigation to select those who are the most vulnerable,” Yadav said. “We are working closely with ward offices to identify those who are in dire need of relief.” The municipality plans to distribute 25kgs of rice, two kgs of lentil grains, one kg of salt, two litres of cooking oil and two soap bars to each family.Yadav said that the relief distribution will start once the most vulnerable families are identified. But people like Pasi have expressed frustration that the local unit has been too slow to act.“We don’t know how long the lockdown will continue,” Pasi said. “And for how long we would have to spend nights in hunger.”Photo: Sushila Pasi at ward-6 office with her toddler.","Published at : April 22, 2020",Bardiya,Kamal Panthi
Local governments in Dang arrange vehicles for migrants heading home on foot,"Lal Bahadur Dangi, 43, a resident of Madi in Rolpa district, had been working as a porter at the Kalimati fruits and vegetables market in Kathmandu for the past 20 years. After the nationwide lockdown was announced to contain the spread of Covid-19, he stayed in his rented room for a few days, but with every passing day, Dangi began toying with the idea of leaving as he was running out of money. “I waited for the lockdown to be lifted,” said Dangi. “But I was running out of food. I was worried I would spend all my savings if I stayed in Kathmandu without a job,” said Dang. “I then decided to walk home.” Dangi reached Ghorahi, Dang on the fifth day of his journey, on Saturday evening. “It was a difficult journey with incomparable pain and suffering,” Dangi told the Post. According to him, he walked all the way from Kathmandu, occasionally hitching rides on trucks. Like Dangi, 25-year-old Gita Nepali, a resident of Runtigadhi in Rolpa, started walking from Parsa with her six-year-old daughter. Nepali, who worked at a brick kiln in Chainpur, finally decided to head home as the lockdown was extended for the third time. “It took us two days and two nights to reach Ghorahi. It’s been very difficult for me making this journey with my little daughter.” Along with Dangi and Nepal, 73 others stranded in Dang got on buses heading to Rolpa arranged by Ghorahi Sub-Metropolitan City on Saturday. The 73, most of them daily wage earners, came to Dang from Kathmandu, Pokhara, Sindhupalchok, Dhading, Gorkha, Chitwan and Parsa.Mayor Narulal Chaudhary said the city decided to arrange vehicles to take the stranded to home. “We still have people coming to Dang on foot to make their way home. We are making arrangements for more vehicles,” he said. Similarly, various organisations are providing the people walking home food and shelter. The local chapter of Nepal Chamber of Commerce and Industry, various transportation companies, other social organisations and individuals have been providing the local government help to send the migrants home.. As Dang is the gateway for many districts including Rolpa, Rukum, Pyuthan and Salyan, a huge number of people trying to get home have arrived in Dang after the lockdown. According to Ghanshyam Pandey, mayor of Tulsipur Sub-metropolis in Dang, as many as 302 people from various districts arrived in Tulsipur during the last three days alone.Various local governments in Dang have set up health desks to conduct health checks of those homebound. “We had examined 182 people by Saturday midnight,” said Bimal KC, public health inspector at Tulsipur Sub-metropolis.

Dang district health office does not have funds to fight Covid-19,"At a time when the hospitals need to work effectively to control the possible spread of Covid-19, Dang District Health Office has been struggling to mobilise its employees due to shortage of budget.The health office, which is under the ambit of the provincial Social Development Ministry, said it also faces difficulties coordinating with subordinate units, and launching awareness drives due to the budget crunch. “We face serious problems mobilising health workers due to the lack of budget. Movement of the employees has been hit the hardest as the office does not have a budget for fuel,” said Sunita Paudel, chief of the health office.”“How can we work in such a critical hour without the necessary budget?” said asked. “Everyone has high expectations from the health office, but it is unfortunate that we can’t do anything due to lack of funds,” she added.The health office set up a health desk in Koilabas, a crossing on the Nepal-India border, weeks ago. It also runs health desks in various places in the district.The Province 5 government on Wednesday released Rs 130 million to all 109 local governments in the province to control the possible outbreak of the deadly virus and provide relief to people affected by lockdown. Nepalgunj Sub-metropolis was provided Rs 2.5 million while Butwal, Ghorahi and Tulsipur sub-metropolises were given Rs 2 million each. The provincial government provided Rs 1.2 million and Rs 1 million to each municipality and rural municipality respectively. The provincial executive council also provided Rs 500,000 to the district coordination committees.Local governments have been managing quarantine facilities and providing reliefs to the needy people.

Lockdown an additional burden for daily wage-earning women in Banke,"On Sunday at noon, around a dozen women were walking on the empty streets in Kohalpur Municipality Ward No. 11 with a load of firewood on their backs. When they saw a team of security personnel patrolling the road, they turned the other way, travelled a bit further and took another route home. They knew they were defying the nationwide lockdown but not by choice.The coronavirus crisis and the lockdown has robbed the women of their jobs. Daily essentials are emptying in their households and they can’t afford to buy cooking gas. Hence, they travel every day to the jungles to collect firewood.This is how the women in Shantinagar spend their days.Janaki Pariyar, a daily wage earner, said that she visits the jungles every other day in search of firewood. “Besides the regular household chore, we have other things to take care of during this lockdown,” said the mother of four. “We have to manage food to eat and firewood to cook it. We are getting by so far but we don’t know how long we can manage if the lockdown continues.”With everybody confined in their houses since the government has imposed a nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of Covid-19, it’s the women who have to shoulder the extra burden of housework, Sumitra Nepali, whose husband returned from India two months ago, said. “For us, the lockdown has been a curse.”It’s harder for those women who depend on daily wage to make a living. “We have to do the housework while also making ends meet,” Sunita Shahi, another local from Shantinagar, said. “And the worse thing during the lockdown is we can’t go searching for work.”  Frequently asked questions about the coronavirus outbreakUPDATED as of September 22, 2020What is Covid-19?Covid-19, short for coronavirus disease, is an illness caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, short for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Common symptoms of the disease include fever, dry cough, fatigue, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In severe cases, the infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. How contagious is Covid-19?Covid-19 can spread easily from person to person, especially in enclosed spaces. The virus can travel through the air in respiratory droplets produced when a sick person breathes, talks, coughs or sneezes. As the virus can also survive on plastic and steel surfaces for up to 72 hours and on cardboard for up to 24 hours, any contact with such surfaces can also spread the virus. Symptoms take between two to 14 days to appear, during which time the carrier is believed to be contagious.Where did the virus come from?The virus was first identified in Wuhan, China in late December. The coronavirus is a large family of viruses that is responsible for everything from the common cold to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). After an initial outbreak in Wuhan that spread across Hubei province, eventually infecting over 80,000 and killing more than 3,000, new infection rates in mainland China have dropped. However, the disease has since spread across the world at an alarming rate.   What is the current status of Covid-19?The World Health Organisation has called the ongoing outbreak a “pandemic” and urged countries across the world to take precautionary measures. Covid-19 has spread to 213 countries and territories around the world and infected more than 31,405,983 people with 967,505 deaths and 22,990,260 recoveries. In South Asia, India has reported the highest number of infections at 5,557,573 with 88,943 deaths. While Pakistan has reported 306,304 confirmed cases with 6,420 deaths. Nepal has so far reported 65,276 cases with 427 deaths.How dangerous is the disease?The mortality rate for Covid-19 is estimated to be 3.6 percent, but new studies have put the rate slightly higher at 5.7 percent. Although Covid-19 is not too dangerous to young healthy people, older individuals and those with immune-compromised systems are at greater risk of death. People with chronic medical conditions like heart disease, diabetes and lung disease, or those who’ve recently undergone serious medical procedures, are also at risk. How do I keep myself safe?The WHO advises that the most important thing you can do is wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizers with at least 60 percent alcohol content. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unclean hands. Clean and disinfect frequently used surfaces like your computers and phones. Avoid large crowds of people. Seek medical attention if symptoms persist for longer than a few days.Is it time to panic?No. The government has imposed a lockdown to limit the spread of the virus. There is no need to begin stockpiling food, cooking gas or hand sanitizers. However, it is always prudent to take sensible precautions like the ones identified above.","Published at : April 14, 2020",Banke,Madhu Shahi
Tests conducted on 49 quarantined in Palpa; all tested negative for Covid-19,"Bijaya BK of Siluwa in Palpa district went home on Friday after staying 16 days in a quarantine facility set up in the village. He was declared ‘fit to go’ after his test for Covid-19 conducted through Rapid Diagnostic Test kit came negative. However, BK who returned home from India is still not very assured as health experts are raising questions about the quality of RDT kits being used in Nepal.“I want to keep myself, my family members and society safe. I will stay in self-quarantine at home for one more week,” said 30-year-old BK who returned through Gauriphanta border point along Nepal-India border in Dhangadhi three weeks ago. He was later brought to Palpa by a bus managed by Province 5 government. Rapid tests were conducted on 49 people staying in various quarantine facilities in the first phase in Palpa. Chief District Officer Yadav Subedi said all 49 samples tested negative for Covid-19. “The quarantined people whose test results were negative were sent home on Friday and Saturday. We have asked them to stay in self-quarantine at home,” he added.Testing for novel coronavirus in the district started after the people representatives stressed the need to test all individuals staying in quarantine facilities and those who are staying in self-quarantine. “The RDT should be conducted on all recent returnees to the district. Some are in self-quarantine at home. The authorities should continue to test as many people as possible,” said Raman Bahadur Thapa, mayor of Rampur Municipality.As many as 15 people are staying in quarantine facilities in the district. Balaram Sunar, a resident of ward No 6 in Rampur Municipality, entered his home on the 21st day of his arrival in Nepal. Like BK he had also gone to India for work and returned home amid coronavirus fears in India. “I don’t have any symptoms of Covid-19 and the RDT also showed negative for the virus. I am finally going home from the quarantine. But I will stay in home quarantine,” Sunar told the Post. Santosh Rana of Siluwa was relieved as his Covid-19 test result came negative because he had caught fever after returning from India two weeks ago. “I suffered from fever on the first day of my arrival. But I was okay the next day. Now that the test has been conducted and the test result is negative, I feel relieved,” he said. Around 1,000 people returned to their homes in Palpa from India in the past one month. In Rukum (East), all 36 people—who had been staying in a quarantine facility at Sisne—have been sent home without any test. Chief District Officer Mohan Prasad Aryal said the people quarantined at a local school in Sisne Ward No 5 were sent home on Wednesday, as they did not show any symptoms of the novel coronavirus during their two weeks stay in the quarantine facility. All 36 had returned from India. Rukum (East) has set up 74-bed quarantine facilities in Sisne, Puthauttarganga and Bhume rural municipalities. Currently, no one is in the quarantine facility.

Fall armyworm destroying corn in Banke and Bardiya,"Fall armyworm has started to invade corn and other crops in Banke and Bardiya districts. Farmers, meanwhile, are worried due to the unavailability of pesticides because of the lockdown.Dil Bahadur Khadka, a local farmer at Madhuban Municipality Ward No. 5 in Bardiya, said the pest was spreading at a destructive pace. “We have tried to control the pest using a traditional way without any success. We are in a desperate need of pesticides. If the lockdown continues, we won’t be able to get pesticides and crops will die,” Khadka said. According to agriculture experts, the fall armyworm, which was once common in the Americas, has been spreading through Africa and Asia since 2016, flying up to 100 km (60 miles) a night. Usually, fall armyworms become active at night and feed on crops.In this season, corn has been planted in 4,900 hectares of fields in Bardiya, according to the Agriculture Knowledge Centre in Bardiya. Fall armyworm has spread in the corn fields at Badhaiyatal Rural Municipality, Bardbardiya, Gulariya, Madhuban and Thakurbaba, among other local units, farmers say. Sagar Dhakal, chief at Agriculture Knowledge Centre in Nepalgunj, said around 80 percent of corn fields have been infested by fall armyworms in Banke and Bardiya districts. “The pesticides are not available due to the lockdown. This is why the outbreak has threatened overall corn production this season,” said Dhakal. In Banke, farmers have cultivated corn in 2,450 hectares of land. The ready-to harvest corn is getting destroyed, according to the farmers. Due to the lack of vehicular movement, farmers are facing shortage of pesticides and other essential fertilisers these days. Usually, pesticides are transported to Banke and Bardiya from Birgunj and other parts of the country. Farmers have requested the agriculture office to immediately start a campaign in the affected areas to control the pest. “This outbreak may threaten the overall grain output from the district this year. That’s why we demand the government to compensate us,” Khadka said.The first case of fall armyworm was reported in Ramechhap in 2019, but lack of timely intervention has led to the spread of the pest in other parts of the country, farmers say.","Published at : April 12, 2020",Bardiya,Kamal Panthi
Nawalparasi locals return spoiled rice distributed as relief,"Residents of Ramgram Municipality in Nawalparasi (West) district have returned rice and other foodstuff provided to them as relief in the face of the coronavirus epidemic.Locals, who received sacs of rice and other food products earlier in the day, returned the relief materials to the municipality office. Sohan Kewat, a local Ward No. 6, said they were provided substandard food items in the name of relief. “The rice and soya chunks we received is not even suitable for cattle,” said Kewat. “We will fall ill if we eat these things. We will remain hungry for a couple of days, but will not eat bug-infested food.” Municipality officials, who earlier in the week collected data of impoverished families in the town, had started distributing relief from wards 6 and 11, halted the programme after facing protests. The municipality had planned to distribute 10kg rice, one kg lentils, half-litre cooking oil, half-kg soya chunks and two bars of soaps to each of 2,300 families on its list. The municipality had purchased 250 quintals of rice from Rajesh Rice shop in Parasi. According to the municipality office, they spent Rs 1 million on the rice. “We had told the supplier to pack the rice and soya chunks and send them to us for distribution,” said Mayor Narendra Kumar Gupta.“When we’d visited the shop, we were shown good quality rice and soya chunks,” he added . According to Gupta, the municipality office is going to test the food items meant for distribution. “We will address the public complaints soon,” he said. Following the incident, the Nawalparasi (West) District Administration Office has formed a five-member team to investigate the incident. Chief District Officer Basudev Dahal said the team led by Sagar Gautam, the administrative officer of the District Administration Office, will verify the quality and quantity of the food items procured.“We have collected samples of rice and soya chunks for quality tests. The results will be disclosed after obtaining lab reports,” said Gautam.

Security personnel patrol border round the clock,"Around a 100 security personnel are patrolling the India-Nepal border in Nawalparasi (West) to prevent people from crossing the frontier after six individuals tested positive for Covid-19 in the neighbouring Maharajganj district in India. On Monday, the District Security Committee decided to step up patrol around Maheshpur customs, Jhulanipur border crossing and other small border points to halt the movement of people.Nawalparasi (West) shares a 28 km-long border with Maharajganj. However, there are only four Armed Police Force posts to guard the entire stretch. Superintendent of Police Bharat Khaniya, head of Battalion No. 26 of the Armed Police Force, said temporary posts have been setup along the border to monitor the movement of people in the area following complaints that people were entering into the country by swimming in the Narayani. According to Khaniya, security personnel patrol the area around the clock these days. “We have set-up 35 makeshift camps to patrol the border,” said Khaniya. “Locals had asked us to deploy more security personnel at the border since movement across smaller border points were going unchecked.” Shiva Narayan Chaudhary, a local of Palhinandan, said people are still ferrying vegetables, food grains and other essentials from India at night. “Some of them say they have come to visit their in-laws; some carry daily essentials in bicycles or motorcycles at night,” said Chaudhary. “The lockdown isn’t very effective in this area and people are still moving freely across the border.”Sagar KC, information officer at the District Administration Office, said that authorities have directed security personnel deployed at the border points to talk to people about the importance of staying put. “People are still crossing the border like they would before the pandemic took its current shape,” he said. “That’s why we had to increase surveillance here.”  Frequently asked questions about the coronavirus outbreakUPDATED as of September 22, 2020What is Covid-19?Covid-19, short for coronavirus disease, is an illness caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, short for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

Relief distribution drive in Banke courts controversy,"Local units across Banke have launched relief distribution drives targeting students, daily wage earners and the impoverished. But the drive has courted controversy as many beneficiaries have accused the local units of bias, while many say the relief material is not sufficient.Nepalgunj Sub-metropolis on Sunday distributed relief materials that included five kg rice and one kg lentil to students staying in their rented rooms in the city. But students say the relief material is not enough to survive. “The sub-metropolis has given us only rice and lentil, but how are we going to cook it without oil and salt?” Khum Bahadur Rawal, who is originally from Humla and is currently stuck in Nepalgunj due to the Covid-19 lockdown, told the Post. As many as 70 students and daily wage-earning labourers have also expressed their dissatisfaction over the quantity of the material distributed. Uma Thapa, deputy mayor of the sub-metropolis, said that the civic body initially didn’t plan to distribute relief material to students, but the plan was amended later after increasing calls for help by students. “Since we had to amend the plan midway, we didn’t have sufficient budget to increase the relief materials,” she said. Meanwhile, in Kohalpur Municipality Ward No. 14, locals staged a protest accusing the people’s representatives of bias in distributing the relief material. Locals have said the material was distributed in secret to those that are close to the representatives. Ward chair Tekchan Harijan has denied the allegations. “The distribution process has been impartial and we are committed to providing sufficient material to the poor and needy,” he said.lsipur sub-metropolis has been more generous in relief distribution, providing 25kg rice, two kg lentil, one kg cooking oil, one pack salt and two pieces of soap to 49 needy families. The sub-metropolis has also distributed 2,500 masks.Controversy in relief distribution has also been reported in other parts of the country. In Lamjung, local units haven’t followed the guidelines presented by the provincial government as a result, locals have reported discrepancies in the distribution.","Published at : April 7, 2020",Banke,Madhu Shahi
Province 5 tightens security along border as people’s movement continues,"Border closures and lockdowns enforced by the governments of Nepal and India to prevent the spread of Covid-19 have not stopped the cross-border movements of people at some border points in Province 5.Nepali security forces say they are concerned about the free movement of people along the border, as the Kolhui Bazaar in India, which lies just across the border, reported six Covid-19 patients on Saturday. District administrations in Province 5 have said they are further tightening the open border and deploying security personnel in areas where the movement of people across the border is high.Province 5 Chief Minister Shankar Pokharel has said he has been holding discussions with administration officers of districts that share a border with India about maintaining high vigilance and monitoring.“We are now compelled to intensify patrolling to stop people from moving across the border, as the bordering towns in India have reported new cases,” Rupandehi CDO Mahadev Pantha said. “We have deployed more security personnel at the bordering areas.” Rupandehi shares about 60km of border with India. This is the first time the Nepal-India border has been tightened to this extent. India, too, has increased its security presence along the border. On Thursday, a meeting between Nepali security officials and their Indian counterpart held discussions on tightening the border on both sides.Kolhui Bazaar, which reported six Covid-19 cases on Saturday, lies about seven km from the Nepal-India border in Marchbar. Prior to the lockdown, people from both the countries moved across the border for shopping and trade purposes.Jitendra Nath Shukla, chief of Sammarmai Rural Municipality, said that despite the border closure, people have been using proxy routes to cross the border in the night. “We have received tip-offs that about a dozen people have been crossing the border daily,” Shukla said. “We are committed to control that.”In Banke too, the district administration has added security forces in all the border crossings, said CDO Kumar Bahadur Khadka. “We have deployed additional APF personnel since the lockdown hasn’t stopped the movement of people along the border,” Khadka said. Banke shares a 65 km long border with India. Other districts in the province, such as Kapilvastu and Bardiya, have also deployed additional security personnel at the border.","Published at : April 6, 2020",Bhairahawa,Madhav Dhungana
"As Province 5 steps up contact tracing to avoid outbreak, health workers decry lack of resources","Twelve days after the government imposed a nationwide lockdown in a bid to control the spread of Covid-19, Province 5 government has said it has intensified the search for individuals who have returned to Nepal after the global spread of the viral disease.Local units in the province have started collecting the record of returnees and quarantining them, but it hasn’t been effective, as many are reluctant to come out, officials say.All 109 local units of Province 5 have set up quarantine facilities, but those who have been residing in those facilities are leaving them since they lack basic amenities. Locals have complained of a lack of drinking water, proper latrine and electricity.According to data from the Province Health Directorate, as of Saturday, a total of 2,351 people have been quarantined in various facilities across 12 districts. About 300 health workers have been deployed at those facilities, according to Provincial Minister of Social Development Sudarshan Baral.The health workers, however, are concerned for their safety, as the province lacks personal protective equipment. While the demand for PPEs is estimated at 10,000, only 1,135 sets have been supplied so far, according to Dinesh Chapagain, director of supply department at the social development ministry. “All the equipment received from the federal government have been distributed among districts,” he said.Focal Personal Dr Sudarshan Thapa of the Temporary Coronavirus Hospital in Butwal said that health personnel are concerned that they might contract the disease since they don’t have protective gears. “The number of protective kits we currently have is clearly not enough,” he said.Besides coronavirus-specific hospitals, Province 5 has set up four isolation hospitals that will treat those who show symptoms of the disease. Until Saturday, a total of 124 individuals have registered at the isolation hospitals, according to Province 5 Health Director Dr Binod Giri.In the province, 83 samples of throat swabs have been tested so far, of which 71 have tested negative and the results of the remaining 12 tests are pending.Meanwhile, all the border points in Bardiya have been sealed after two of its neighbouring districts, Kailali and Kanchanpur, reported three Covid-19 cases on Saturday. Frequently asked questions about the coronavirus outbreakUPDATED as of September 22, 2020What is Covid-19?Covid-19, short for coronavirus disease, is an illness caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, short for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Common symptoms of the disease include fever, dry cough, fatigue, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In severe cases, the infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. How contagious is Covid-19?Covid-19 can spread easily from person to person, especially in enclosed spaces. The virus can travel through the air in respiratory droplets produced when a sick person breathes, talks, coughs or sneezes. As the virus can also survive on plastic and steel surfaces for up to 72 hours and on cardboard for up to 24 hours, any contact with such surfaces can also spread the virus. Symptoms take between two to 14 days to appear, during which time the carrier is believed to be contagious.Where did the virus come from?The virus was first identified in Wuhan, China in late December. The coronavirus is a large family of viruses that is responsible for everything from the common cold to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). After an initial outbreak in Wuhan that spread across Hubei province, eventually infecting over 80,000 and killing more than 3,000, new infection rates in mainland China have dropped. However, the disease has since spread across the world at an alarming rate.   What is the current status of Covid-19?The World Health Organisation has called the ongoing outbreak a “pandemic” and urged countries across the world to take precautionary measures. Covid-19 has spread to 213 countries and territories around the world and infected more than 31,405,983 people with 967,505 deaths and 22,990,260 recoveries. In South Asia, India has reported the highest number of infections at 5,557,573 with 88,943 deaths. While Pakistan has reported 306,304 confirmed cases with 6,420 deaths. Nepal has so far reported 65,276 cases with 427 deaths.How dangerous is the disease?The mortality rate for Covid-19 is estimated to be 3.6 percent, but new studies have put the rate slightly higher at 5.7 percent. Although Covid-19 is not too dangerous to young healthy people, older individuals and those with immune-compromised systems are at greater risk of death. People with chronic medical conditions like heart disease, diabetes and lung disease, or those who’ve recently undergone serious medical procedures, are also at risk. How do I keep myself safe?The WHO advises that the most important thing you can do is wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizers with at least 60 percent alcohol content. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unclean hands. Clean and disinfect frequently used surfaces like your computers and phones. Avoid large crowds of people. Seek medical attention if symptoms persist for longer than a few days.Is it time to panic?No. The government has imposed a lockdown to limit the spread of the virus. There is no need to begin stockpiling food, cooking gas or hand sanitizers. However, it is always prudent to take sensible precautions like the ones identified above.","Published at : April 5, 2020",Butwal,Province 5 Bureau
Recent returnees leave a quarantine facility in Rupandehi citing poor management,"Twenty-four people who were quarantined in Sammarimai Rural Municipality, Rupandehi, have left the facility, citing lack of food and proper accommodation. The municipal office had set-up a quarantine facility at a local madrasa in Asuraina five days ago. All 24 individuals had arrived from different parts of India in the last 10 days. They had been brought to the quarantine facility on Monday. By Thursday evening, all 24 had left the facility. According to Munsi Prasad Yadav, the health coordinator of the rural municipality, the quarantined people were discharged after informing their respective ward chairpersons. “We couldn’t stop them from leaving. They complained of not having proper facilities here. Some of them were getting agitated,” Yadav said. “The municipal office decided to let them go to avoid possible clashes between them and the health workers.”The municipal office, however, is not sure whether the people who left the quarantine facility were observing self-isolation at their homes. “We don’t have any information about their status since they left the quarantine on Thursday evening,” said Yadav. Those who were staying in the quarantine facility had been protesting since the first day. “We were fed only rice and potato soup. We couldn’t sleep at night because of the mosquitoes. We decided to leave the facility was poorly managed,” said a man from Sammarimai, who spent five days in the facility.","Published at : April 4, 2020",Butwal,Amrita Anmol
Family of man suspected of Covid-19 infection refuses to accept his body alleging hospital of negligence,"Six days after the death of Baburam Thapa, who was suspected of Covid-19 infection but later tested negative, his family is yet to collect the body. The family allege the hospital of negligence in Thapa’s treatment. Thapa died on Sunday at the makeshift coronavirus-specific hospital in Butwal. His body is currently kept at Lumbini Provincial Hospital.Reiterating that there was negligence from the hospital administration, Thapa’s wife, Rita, said that the family will not accept the body until there’s an investigation into the death. “We want an investigation into his death,” said Rita. “We want relief and government’s assurance to bear the cost of the study of our two children, among other things.”Provincial Minister of Social Development Sudarshan Baral admitted that there were “managerial shortcomings” in Thapa’s treatment.“We admit that we couldn’t manage a ventilator and an ICU facility at the makeshift hospital,” he said. “There has been a managerial shortcoming, but it’s wrong to accuse the hospital administration and physicians of negligence.”Baral added that since the patient was suffering from respiratory diseases and was suspected of carrying Covid-19, transferring him to an ICU where other patients were getting treatment was risky.“But this is not a case of negligence from the hospital administration and physicians, so the family should collect the body,” the minister said.The 34-year-old man from Palpa district was kept in an isolation ward set up at the makeshift coronavirus-specific hospital in Butwal after he suffered from fever and cough, two of the major symptoms of Covid-19. Thapa had returned from Dubai a week ago and was admitted at the isolation facility on March 26, as referred by the Lumbini Provincial Hospital (LPH), where the man had first visited. Dr Rajendra Khanal, medical superintendent at Lumbini Provincial Hospital, said that Thapa was referred to the coronavirus-centric hospital after he showed symptoms of Covid-19.“Even though he was not severely ill, the man showed symptoms of Covid-19, like fever and cough,” Khanal said. “He was normal until Saturday evening, but suddenly, on Sunday morning, he was critically ill.” When Thapa was pronounced dead three days after he was admitted to the hospital, his throat swab was yet to be tested, Khanal said. Khanal said that the hospital collects throat swabs of about a dozen patients for three days before sending them to the Capital for tests. “The provincial government thinks it’s costly to send individual samples,” he said.Thapa’s wife, Rita, 27, has also alleged the hospital of keeping the family in the dark, refusing to provide information about his health status. “It is only after he died that we got to know his test was delayed,” she said. Butwal sends the throat swabs of individuals suspected of Covid-19 infections to the Kathmandu-based Teku Hospital every three days. Teku Hospital was the only testing lab in the country until the government expanded the facility to Dharan and Hetauda.","Published at : April 4, 2020",Butwal,Amrita Anmol						 &
"Rolpa locals, people’s representatives decry the federal government’s indifference in handling Covid-19 in the district","With the nationwide lockdown extended until April 7, local units in Rolpa have scrambled to adopt measures to keep the novel coronavirus disease from spreading, but representatives and locals say they doubt if those measures would suffice without help from the federal government.All of the district’s ten local units have called meetings over the week and have established funds to control the contingent spread of the disease. They are establishing quarantine facilities and using loudspeakers to raise awareness among the people about the disease.Chief of Sunchhahari Rural Municipality Aash Bahadur Pun Magar said in the past three days, he has visited all of the local unit’s six wards and has taken stock of how people are reacting to the pandemic. “I have visited several villages in the local unit, have shared my knowledge about the disease, and asked them not to worry,” he said.Magar further said that people are still to get serious about the disease. “Many people are stigmatised by the disease,” he said. “Many of those who have recently returned from foreign countries have yet to come forward to stay in quarantine facilities.”Chief Balaram Budhamagar of Runtigadhi Rural Municipality said that the local unit has allocated a fund of Rs3million for campaigns against coronavirus and has established a makeshift hospital and quarantine facility. Like in several other local units, Runtigadhi has also established a health desk and recommended those who suffer from fever and cough to visit it, Budhamagar said.Mayor Purna KC of Liwang, the district headquarters, said the number of people coming to the municipality from abroad since the spread of Covid-19 has reached 89, all of whom would be quarantined.But despite these well-meaning efforts from the local units, there are obstacles, say local unit representatives and locals. Nimakanta Dangi, chief of Paribartan Rural Municipality, said that the health officials in the local unit lack personal protection equipment (PPE) and have corresponded with the federal government asking to provide them.Other local unit representatives say even though they are running efforts against the disease, they are confused about how to move forward.“If the provincial and federal government had given us a definite modality about how to proceed, it would have been easier for us,” Aash Bahadur Pun, chief of Sunchhahari Rural Municipality, said. “But we haven’t received any guidelines.”Bir Bahadur Khatri, chief of Gangadev Rural Municipality, echoed Pun. “This is a time when the federal government and lawmakers should have been serious about how villages are responding to the impending crisis,” he said. “But we haven’t heard from them yet while health workers in villages lack protective gears and equipment.”While the people’s representatives say they haven’t received help from federal and provincial governments, locals say they are not satisfied with the local units’ efforts. “The local units have yet to quarantine people who have returned from abroad,” said Khem Budhamagar, a rights activist.The district administration has yet to take account of the returnees while the police estimate the number might be around 10,000.","Published at : April 1, 2020",Rolpa,Kashiram Dangi
Police arrest landlord for evicting a staff nurse from her rented house in Dang,"Police on Tuesday arrested a landlord in Ghorahi who asked his tenant, a staff nurse, to vacate her flat. Narayan Acharya had refused entry to his tenant to her rented flat since Saturday citing his fear of contracting coronavirus from her. The staff nurse had taken up residence at Acharya’s house from mid-November last year.Deputy Superintendent of Police Sumit Khadka, who is also the spokesperson for Dang district police, said, “We arrested Acharya on Tuesday following a complaint from his tenant.”Balaram Sharma, the director of Buddha International Hospital where the staff nurse is currently employed, said that he had accompanied her to the police station on Monday. “She made a verbal complaint against her landlord,” said Sharma. The staff nurse, who asked her name to be withheld for privacy reasons, has been staying at a hotel since her eviction, according to Govinda Prasad Rijal, chief district officer of Dang. “We have asked her to see us so that the investigation can move forward,” he said. Acharya is also the secretary of Ghorahi Sub-metropolis Ward No. 2, according to Rijal.When the Post contacted the evicted tenant, she refused to comment.Meanwhile, following the incident, the District Administration Office on Monday issued a notice requesting landlords to refrain from such activities. ""Any landlord asking health workers to vacate their residence will be punished according to the law,"" reads the notice.Ever since the novel coronavirus pandemic reached Nepal with five positive cases reported so far, reports of health care workers being subjected to forced evictions from their rented houses and mistreatment by their landlords are doing the rounds.While no complaints have been filed with the police so far in Kathmandu, there is a growing concern of discriminatory behaviour towards health professionals.  Frequently asked questions about the coronavirus outbreakUPDATED as of September 22, 2020What is Covid-19?Covid-19, short for coronavirus disease, is an illness caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, short for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

Around 400 Nepalis stranded at Sunauli border point stage a sit-in,"On Monday, around 400 Nepalis including migrant workers, waiting to be allowed in through the Sunauli border point for the last three days, started a sit-in in the no-man’s-land area. The stranded are seeking entry into Nepal and are asking the government to keep them in a quarantine facility. Read: Nepalis are swimming across the Mahakali to get homeSunil Khanal, a local of Malarani in Arghakhanchi, who was at the sit-in reached Sunauli on Friday from Ghaziabad in India. “Yesterday the security personnel started baton charging us and forced us back towards the Indian side of the border,” he said. “But the Indian security force also stopped us from going back to India. We had no choice but to stage this sit-in in the no-man’s land for our message to reach the authorities.” According to Khanal, they have collected the names and addresses of the 400 stranded following the request of the District Administration Office in Rupandehi. According to the Area Police Office in Belhiya, a scuffle had broken out between the protestors and the security personnel deployed at the border point on Monday night when the former had tried to force their way across the border point. Janak Thapa, the information officer and also the administrative officer of the District Administration Office in Rupandehi, said the federal and provincial governments have not taken a decision yet as to the fate of the ones stranded at the Sunauli border. “We are trying to find a solution but have to await order from the higher authorities.” Some locals of Belhiya and Sunauli and various social organisations in Bhairawaha are providing food and water to the stranded for the past three days. On Monday, a Cabinet meeting of Province 5 government passed a decision to rescue the stranded Nepalis across various border points in the province and facilitate their travel to their home districts. The meeting also decided to keep them in quarantine facilities in their respective districts. The decision, however, is yet to be implemented. Three days ago, a high-level committee for the prevention and control of Covid-19 led by Deputy Prime Minister Ishwar Pokhrel had decided to rescue all stranded Nepalis at various border points of the country.

Ghorahi to close all grocery shops from Monday evening,"A meeting of Ghorahi Sub Metropolis Disaster Management Committee held on Sunday decided to close all shops including those selling daily essentials until April 7 from Monday evening. Since the nationwide lockdown came into effect on March 24, grocery stores were allowed to operate between 6am to 9am daily. However, given the rush at these stores in the stipulated time, the sub-metropolis decided to close them down completely lest it leads to the spread of the coronavirus. Narulal Chaudhary, mayor of Ghorahi Sub Metropolis, said the authorities took the decision to shut all stores but have ensured that people get their supplies of daily essentials at their doorsteps. “The Dang Chamber of Commerce and Industry will be coordinating with the local unit to ensure that daily essentials reach the people,” said Chaudhary. “Keeping the stores open only led to people coming out in droves at the same time. We had to put a stop to it.” Following the committee’s decision, the market saw a steady flow of people on Monday morning at the market. Locals came out to buy food grains and vegetables. One among them was Sushma Pokharel who said she came out to stock up her pantry with a few days’ supplies. “We heard that the local government will start home delivery. If they do, we won't have to worry that much,” said Pokharel. Ambika Prasad Dangi, an associate professor at Mahendra Multiple Campus in Ghorahi, said he’s happy with the decision the committee made. “All citizens should be careful. The lockdown has put a stop to crowd gathering but there were still instances where people were going out to buy daily supplies,” said Dangi. According to the sub-metropolis officials, the public can make a call at 082560063 to the Dang Chamber of Commerce and Industry, if they need any supplies delivered to them. “We will ensure that the public will get everything they need at their doorsteps. We decided to close the market completely to stop the unnecessary movement of people in the market areas,” said Chaudhary. “This step will hopefully help mitigate the risk of spreading the disease.”  Frequently asked questions about the coronavirus outbreakUPDATED as of September 22, 2020What is Covid-19?Covid-19, short for coronavirus disease, is an illness caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, short for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

Dairy farmers left with large stocks of unsold milk as country comes to a halt,"Dairy farmer Ganesh Pokhrel of Tilotama used to sell 150 litres of milk daily and he was a happy man. Then the lockdown hit, and his sales stopped. With life coming to a standstill across the entire country to stop possible spread of Covid-19, Pokhrel has nowhere to sell his milk.Consumers too have stopped buying milk for fear of catching the infection. Most milk shops in Rupandehi have closed down which has created a problem for farmers.According to Pokhrel, fewer people are coming to his home to buy milk. “If we make paneer from the milk, it does not last very long,” he said. Pokhrel used to sell the milk from his farm to a dairy in Butwal. “In this situation, I have no option but to dump the milk on the road,” he said.Dairy traders in the district used to open for business for three hours in the morning and two hours in evening. Since Wednesday, they have shut down completely and will remain closed till March 31 due to increasing fears of infection, said Netra Pathak, president of the Rupandehi Dairy Traders Committee.State-owned Dairy Development Corporation has also stopped collecting milk, making it hard to manage the milk collected from dairies in the district.Pathak said they could do nothing except apologise to the farmers. The committee decided to close all shops after they started getting mobbed by customers due to the unavailability of milk in other places. Yagya Murti Khanal, operator of Uma Devi Gai Farm, says he is facing a big problem after not being able to sell his milk. “What am I going to do with my daily output of 600 litres of milk?”He has not been able to get feed for his cows too. Several dairies and milk companies used to buy his milk, now due to the fear of Covid-19, sales have fallen to zero.As there is fear everywhere, Krishna Subedi, a resident of Kalika Nagar-11, Butwal has stopped going to buy milk. “Dairy shops are always crowded, and handling money is also risky,” she said. “So I decided not to purchase milk for some time.” She said she would not buy milk until the situation returns to normal.Krishna Prasad Bhattarai, president of the Dairy Association of Province 5, says dairy traders are worried because of the large numbers of people gathering at the sales centre and handling currency notes.“We were supplying milk understanding the needs of consumers,” he said. But the association was compelled to shut down the dairy shops after people disregarded requests not to form crowds.The traders were asked to serve customers by wearing gloves and using hand sanitisers.As it is impossible to set up a plant immediately to make use of the unsold milk, the association has requested farmers to make different products from the milk and sell them at a fair price.Bhattarai said that arrangements were being made to sell different milk products by contacting consumers directly.Bashudev Ghimire, head of Tilotama Municipality, said he understood the farmers’ problems, but he was not able to make any work plan immediately. “If traders and farmers come with an immediate plan for the management of the milk being produced by dairy farms, we are ready to help,” he said. Things will be a little more difficult for traders, he added.Hira KC, head of Devdaha Municipality, said they had been trying to contact dairy plants in the country to solve the problem of farmers. “Managing vegetables can be done, but the distribution of milk is a big problem. We have been working to provide relief to milk producers.”","Published at : March 29, 2020",Tilotama,Sanju Paudel
Rolpa District Hospital lacks medical equipment to collect and preserve nasal and throat swabs from Covid-19 suspects,"A 58-year-old man of Kotgaun in Rolpa Municipality has been kept in isolation as a suspect case of Covid-19 at the District Hospital since Thursday. But the hospital is yet to collect his nasal and throat swabs required for testing for a lack of necessary medical equipment. The brick kiln worker at a brick kiln factory in Kathmandu had returned to his village a few days ago, according to Anil KC, chief at the Health Office in the district. “The man has been kept in isolation at the District Hospital after the villagers brought him to the hospital on Thursday. He was suffering from high fever,” said KC. “But now his condition is normal.”Tul Bahadur Ghartimagar, ward chairman of Rolpa Municipality Ward No. 6, said the patient’s family members have been asked to stay in self-quarantine in their own house. Two people each from Madi and Tribeni who had recently returned to their villages have also been kept in self-quarantine since their return. The District Hospital has set-up a four-bed isolation ward to combat the possible spread of the virus. But health workers at the hospital complain about not having the necessary medical equipment to collect the nasal and throat swabs of the suspected patients. Dr Prakash Bahadur Budha of the District Hospital said Viral Transport Media is necessary to ensure effective collection and transportation of swabs. “We don’t have the media to collect the nasal and throat swabs. We need to preserve the sample,” said Budha, “to send it to the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease to test for coronavirus.” In the past few weeks, Rolpa saw many migrant workers returning to their homes from Kathmandu and foreign countries, but no strict measures are being taken to prevent them from mingling with the local population. This, health officials say, will lead to the local transmission of the virus.Girish Pun, a local of Thabang, said people who have recently returned to the villages are not self-isolating and are instead seen idling around the market areas. “The local unit should inform them about the dangers of going out at a moment like this. They should actively raise awareness about why it’s necessary for them to stay indoors.” The local administration agrees that most recent returnees are seen visiting their relatives and friends despite the lockdown. Bir Bahadur Khatri, chairman of Gangadev Rural Municipality in western Rolpa, said they are having a tough time making people understand the gravity of the current situation. “We haven't set-up a quarantine facility so far. We have informed the locals and the newcomers to stay indoors but not many have listened,” said Khatri.In Gangadev alone, more than 450 migrant workers returned to their villages from India after the lockdown. Tribeni, Runtigadhi, Sunchhahari, Sunilsmriti and Lungri in the municipality have also requested the returnees and other villagers to stay indoors. Laxman Dhakal, Chief District Officer, says it’s the responsibility of the people’s representatives to encourage people to stay in their houses during the lockdown. “More than 10,000 people of Rolpa have returned to their villages in the past few weeks from coronavirus-hit countries. The people’s representatives must make sure that these people take every precautionary measure to prevent the spread of the virus in the villages.”","Published at : March 28, 2020",Rolpa,Kashiram Dangi
"Province 5 ready to tackle contingent food shortages, officials say","The province 5 government and local councils have floated plans to ease the supply of goods during the ongoing nationwide lockdown.Tilottama Municipality in Rupandehi has pledged to distribute foodstuffs including rice, lentils and salt among daily wage-earners.“We will identify the families that are in need of urgent help and deliver 10kg rice, 2kg lentils and one kilo salt to their homes,” Basudev Ghimire, the mayor of Tilottama, said. “We will take further steps to ease the supply of essentials after assessing the situation.”According to the municipal office, all the wards have an average of 800 impoverished families that need support.An all-party meeting on Thursday urged landowners to waive the rent for one month for all tenants in the municipality and announced that delays in the payment of rental taxes and other charges would be accepted.“The meeting has also decided to monitor the lockdown,” Ghimire said, adding that essential services like ambulance, milk and water vendors, and petrol pumps would run as usual.Meanwhile, Siyari Rural Municipality has announced the completion of a makeshift hospital at a local school that has been set up as a quarantine facility, and has pledged to provide food and accommodation for quarantined individuals, according to Ayodhya Prasad Tharu, chief of the rural municipality.Province 5 Chief Minister Shankar Pokharel has asked every local unit to remain alert for contingent emergencies during the lockdown. He has also requested local units to set up quarantine facilities and to maintain a record and monitor those who have recently returned from India and other countries. According to Pokharel, all ministries will coordinate to ease the supply of goods and deal with contingent crises in the province.“We are especially committed to making provisions of essential goods and reducing crowds while delivering services,” Bharat Subedi, secretary to the Province 5 Cabinet, said.Meanwhile, the Palpa administration has announced that the district doesn’t have a shortage of food. The District Coordination Committee on Thursday pledged to monitor people’s access to essential goods and services. The committee has requested traders to keep their shops open for three hours in morning and two hours in the evening over the period of lockdown.The shops will remain open from 7 to 10 in the morning and 4 to 6 in the evening, according to Meera Marasini, chief of the coordination committee. The committee has also asked shops to manage a spot to wash hands and to wear masks as precautions.In Dang, the administration has requested the district chamber of commerce and local units to monitor black marketing of goods. The Lamahi Municipality has formed a monitoring committee led by Mayor Kul Bahadur KC. “If we find there’s black marketing or artificial shortage of goods, we will resort to stringent measures,” KC said.Biru Rawat, chair of the Tulsipur Chamber of Commerce, said that his office has informed all businesspeople to be honest and refrain from black marketeering.“The district has enough food supplies for at least a month,” Narayan Bhusal, chair of the Dang District Chamber of Commerce, said. Moreover, the district administration has requested all the local units to identify wage-earners and provide food to them.While the provincial and local governments are on high alert, the local residents have also stepped up measures to mitigate the risk of Covid-19 transmission. A majority of local federal units have set up barriers along roads to stop the movement of people and vehicles. In some places, people have banned outsiders who venture into the settlements without the permission of the respective local unit.Locals of Devinagar, Banijya Campus and other areas in Butwal have built barricades and are informing the local administration if an outsider enters their settlement.In Malubhung of the Tulsipur sub-metropolis, all outsiders are prohibited from visiting the settlement. Yam Prasad Subedi, chairman of the Ekata Tole Bikash Sanstha, said they have decided to counsel outsiders on why it’s necessary for them to take precautions but if anyone is found breaching the local administration’s directive repeatedly will be fined Rs 2,000. “We have decided to prohibit movement to stop the possible spread of the virus,” said Subedi.In Lamahi Municipality Ward 5, Ramailo Tole has blocked the main thoroughfare and started awareness programmes to keep the local population informed about the ways the novel coronavirus spreads. While residents are found to be abiding by the lockdown order and following the local government’s directives in most parts of the province, in rural areas of Nawalparasi (East) and (West), many are found to be defying the prohibitory measures. Although the lockdown has been effective in bazaar areas so far, the rural areas remain untouched.Youths of Nawalparasi (West) on Friday decided to impose a ban on vehicular movement after the locals did not take the lockdown seriously in the first three days. Barricades carrying banners with messages to abide by the lockdown have been put up in several places.Sushant Ghimire, a resident of Sarawal, said, “We have started to send migrant workers [who recently arrived in the villages] in self-quarantine. We are organising awareness programmes in villages to inform the locals about the importance of social distancing and maintaining hygiene.”In Kawasoti, Nawalparasi (East), some locals of Taruwa have come together to make others follow the lockdown order. They have also decided to impose a fine of Rs 5,000 on anyone defying the lockdown. Ashok Mahato, a Kawasoti local, said they had to resort to putting up physical barriers on the roads since the first three days of the lockdown saw vehicles still being operated.“We are forced to restrict vehicular movement here because we had vehicles coming in carrying outsiders even after the lockdown went into effect on Tuesday,” said Mahato.

Fear and worries as Province 5 district administrations lack records of people coming from India,"About a week ago, 17 border points in Province 5 were open, seeing hundreds of people arriving from India, which has so far reported over 500 Covid-19 cases. But there was no restriction of any kind in the border; those who passed the temperature test could move ahead. The authorities didn’t keep a record of where they were coming from and where they were going to either. And nobody was quarantined. At one point, the border point of Sunauli saw a staggering 18,000 people on a single day as the news of coronavirus cases spread fear and chaos among Nepali migrants.The district administration woke up only when the borders were shut and recorded information about those who entered Nepal after border lockdown. “We can do nothing about those who have already entered the country, but we are trying to quarantine all of those who will enter Nepal from now on,” Mahadev Panth, Rupandehi’s chief district officer, told the Post. “Since the footfall at the border before the lockdown was so high, we couldn’t keep their data.”In Nawalparasi (West), the district administration has reported about 5,000 people entering Nepal through various border points. Of them, there were 3,000 Nepalis, who were in India for study and employment, and had returned home following the Covid-19 outbreak. In the district, too, they were not tested except for simple thermal screening. Chief District Officer Basudev Dahal said they were let into Nepal after checking their surface temperature. “We didn’t keep records of where they were going because of the crowd,” he said. The local units in the district, however, have designated quarantine facilities for the returnees.Dang, too, saw about 5,000 returnees from India in the past two weeks, but nobody is currently in quarantine. Even though the district administration has ordered the returnees to stay in self-isolation, there’s no regulation for a lack of records, according to Kul Bahadur KC, Mayor of Ghorahi. District administrations of Rolpa and Pyuthan, too, report the same.“We have requested everyone who has recently returned from India and other countries to stay in self-isolation,” said Chief District Officer of Pyuthan Lakshman Dhakal. “And almost all the local units have set up quarantine facilities.”In Palpa, three of the district’s ten local units have set up quarantine facilities, following the directive of the Corona Infection and Treatment task force, while other local units are still scrambling to do the same. “We have asked all the local units to set up at least 50 bed-strong quarantine facilities each,” Chief District Officer of Palpa Yadav Subedi said. “This will give us enough time to prepare for a worst-case scenario.”In Bardiya, however, 104 people who recently returned from India have been kept at quarantine facilities in various places, while two individuals suspected of COvid-19 have been administered in the district hospital, according to Deputy Superintendent of Police Rajeshnath Bastola. “We have designated seven places across the district as quarantine facilities,” Durgabahadur Tharu, mayor of Barbardiya Municipality, said. “They are equipped with basic facilities.”An individual in Kapilvastu who travelled on the same plane as the 19-year-old patient who was diagnosed with Covid-19 has been quarantined, according to Deputy Superintendent of Police Sunil Malla of Kapilvastu police. However, the individual hasn’t shown any symptoms yet, Malla said. But the quarantine facility lacks basic amenities except for a rickety bed and mosquito net, according to locals.In Nepalgunj, officials are scrambling to search for the 500 individuals from various districts who left the rescue facility in Nepalgunj Multiple Campus on Monday. The individuals had entered Nepal from the Nepalgunj border point. Uma Thapa, deputy mayor of Nepalgunj sub-metropolis, said that the administration doesn’t have know-how about where they went. But Chief District Officer of Banke Kumarbahadur Khadka said that his office has corresponded with respective district administrations to quarantine the people who left the facility.

Frequently asked questions about the coronavirus outbreakUPDATED as of September 22, 2020What is Covid-19?Covid-19, short for coronavirus disease, is an illness caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, short for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Common symptoms of the disease include fever, dry cough, fatigue, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In severe cases, the infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. How contagious is Covid-19?Covid-19 can spread easily from person to person, especially in enclosed spaces. The virus can travel through the air in respiratory droplets produced when a sick person breathes, talks, coughs or sneezes. As the virus can also survive on plastic and steel surfaces for up to 72 hours and on cardboard for up to 24 hours, any contact with such surfaces can also spread the virus. Symptoms take between two to 14 days to appear, during which time the carrier is believed to be contagious.Where did the virus come from?The virus was first identified in Wuhan, China in late December. The coronavirus is a large family of viruses that is responsible for everything from the common cold to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). After an initial outbreak in Wuhan that spread across Hubei province, eventually infecting over 80,000 and killing more than 3,000, new infection rates in mainland China have dropped. However, the disease has since spread across the world at an alarming rate.   What is the current status of Covid-19?The World Health Organisation has called the ongoing outbreak a “pandemic” and urged countries across the world to take precautionary measures. Covid-19 has spread to 213 countries and territories around the world and infected more than 31,405,983 people with 967,505 deaths and 22,990,260 recoveries. In South Asia, India has reported the highest number of infections at 5,557,573 with 88,943 deaths. While Pakistan has reported 306,304 confirmed cases with 6,420 deaths. Nepal has so far reported 65,276 cases with 427 deaths.How dangerous is the disease?The mortality rate for Covid-19 is estimated to be 3.6 percent, but new studies have put the rate slightly higher at 5.7 percent. Although Covid-19 is not too dangerous to young healthy people, older individuals and those with immune-compromised systems are at greater risk of death. People with chronic medical conditions like heart disease, diabetes and lung disease, or those who’ve recently undergone serious medical procedures, are also at risk. How do I keep myself safe?The WHO advises that the most important thing you can do is wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizers with at least 60 percent alcohol content. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unclean hands. Clean and disinfect frequently used surfaces like your computers and phones. Avoid large crowds of people. Seek medical attention if symptoms persist for longer than a few days.Is it time to panic?No. The government has imposed a lockdown to limit the spread of the virus. There is no need to begin stockpiling food, cooking gas or hand sanitizers. However, it is always prudent to take sensible precautions like the ones identified above.","Published at : March 25, 2020",Rupandehi,Madhav Dhungana
540 Nepalis returning from India leave ‘rescue facility’ in Nepalgunj,"A total of 540 Nepalis brought to Nepalgunj on Monday morning from the Jamunaha border crossing and kept at Mahendra Multiple Campus have left the ‘rescue facility’.Banke District Administration Office and Nepalgunj Sub-metropolitan City had brought nearly 540 Nepalis stranded at the Nepal-India border after it was closed on Monday morning. A Cabinet meeting on Sunday had decided to close all border points with India and China for a week starting 10am on Monday.As many Nepalis arrived at the Jamunaha-Rupaidiha crossing on Monday morning, district authorities allowed the returnees to enter Nepal and kept them at the campus. The returnees said authorities kept them at a mismanaged, overcrowded and poorly-equipped facility, and demanded that they be allowed to leave. Some of the people climbed the fence and left. The rest followed suit.  A policeman stationed at the campus, said, “Some of them hopped onto auto rickshaws and left while others hid in the surrounding fields. We tried to stop them but we could not.” “We were at high risk of contracting coronavirus at the facility. More than 30 people were kept in one room. We thought it better to leave than stay in such a crowded place,” said Netra Bahadur BK of Bardiya, one of the migrant workers returning from India on Monday. But authorities said they were planning to prepare a quarantine facility for the returnees. “We kept around 540 people at the camp after we brought them from the border in the morning. We were making necessary arrangements, but they ran away,” said Uma Thapa, deputy mayor of Nepalgunj sub-metropolis.The local administration, however, claimed the place where the returnees were kept was not a quarantine facility. “It was not a quarantine facility. We were only accommodating them there until we made other arrangements,” said Kumar Bahadur Khadka, chief district officer of Banke.","Published at : March 23, 2020",Nepalgunj,Madhu Shahi

"In Butwal, juvenile delinquents are compelled to stay at a crowded correctional facility without proper means","The correctional facility for juvenile delinquents in Butwal has two dingy rooms and 26 beds. But that is not sufficient for all of the 89 delinquents staying in the facility. As many as four juveniles sleep crammed in a single bed while many others sleep on the floor.As a result of the overcrowding, many suffer from skin-related diseases. “Last year, it was scabies,” Pitambar Neupane, the office helper, said. “Many kids caught it and are still recovering.” According to Neupane, the facility has the capacity to host 60 children, but it currently houses 89.Chief of the correctional facility Shubhadra Gautam admitted that the house does not have enough space for all the delinquents. “The physicians had told us to manage ample space for the children to play, and create an atmosphere where they can study well,” she said. “But the existing environment is definitely not up to that.”Besides the infrastructural shortcoming, the building also doesn’t have playthings for its inhabitants. It, however, does have a television, the only recreational medium for the children. Gautam said that even though she’s attempted to get the children to learn some skill-set, no help has been forthcoming.The prison management department, responsible for the upkeep of the facility, allocates a yearly budget of Rs75,000, which is not enough, according to Gautam. “The children are clearly not happy with the current situation,” she said. “But despite repeated calls, no help has come yet.” Gautam cited one instance in winter when she had requested Siddharthanagar Municipality for firewood, but the request went unheeded.Gautam added that eight of the children are currently studying for exams but they do not have a tutor or enough stationeries. “I committed a mistake and I don’t have any qualms to bear the punishment,” one child staying in the facility said on conditions of anonymity. “But I’m sad that I have been deprived of a proper environment to study.”According to existing laws, there should be separate facilities for juvenile delinquents based on their age groups. But here, all are housed at the same facility irrespective of their age. As a result, the younger delinquents are facing more problems, Gautam said. The laws state that children between 10 and 18 years of age should be kept at correctional facilities instead of prison cells.What is happening at the correctional facility in Butwal is a worrying issue concerning child rights, said Shiva Prasad Gaudel, chair of Children’s Welfare Organisation. “Even though we have the law in place, there’s nobody to advocate for the rights of the delinquents,” he said.","Published at : March 22, 2020",Rupandehi,Amrita Anmol
"Despite the government’s move to close all border points except four, small border points open for human movement in province 5","Movement of people through small border crossings with India in Province 5 has not stopped despite the decision to close all small border crossings to stem the possible spread of coronavirus. In Province 5 alone, there are nearly 18 small border crossing points between Nepal and India from where people are moving freely. While the authorities are keeping record of the people entering through the Bhairahawa-Sunauli border—one of the four main border crossings that the governments of Nepal and India have agreed to keep open—no such precautionary measure is taking place at small border crossings.On Tuesday, a group of six Nepali students who entered Nepal through the Krishnanagar border point in Kapilvastu refused to have their temperature taken with a digital thermometer at the health desk established at the border. When the health personnel told the students that they would not be allowed to enter the country without getting tested for temperature, the students began chanting protest slogans. The situation calmed only after the health desk brought a thermal temperature device to take the students’ temperatures. Auxiliary health workers Ahmad Khan and Nabin Prasad Dangi, both deployed at the Krishnanagar border point, to screen the people entering the country, say the health desk lacks the equipment to test people for coronavirus symptoms without putting them at infection risk. The health professionals themselves are also at risk as they lack protective gear. “We had to buy masks with our own money since the local administration did not provide us with one,” said Khan. Hathihawa, Dohani, Rangapur, Hadauna and Kushahawa are some of the villages in Kapilvastu that share border with India.In Bhairahawa-Sunauli border, stringent measures have been put on place by both sides to prevent the Covid-19 from spreading, but just 2km away at the border crossing at Danda River, the situation is very different. The bi-weekly market on the Indian side which primarily sees Nepali consumers is still in operation. Known as the Ferena Bazaar, Nepalis and Indians throng the market in thousands to buy daily essentials. “We have heard about the virus in our village but don’t know much about it. No one has told us it is unsafe to travel to a crowded marketplace,” said Sita Karki of Suddhodan Rural Municipality. She and three of her neighbours were returning from the Indian market after buying daily essentials. Meanwhile, some border towns in India are reportedly organising fairs targeting the Nepalis returning home in droves due to coronavirus fears. Likewise, the number of Nepalis going to such fairs in India to shop for daily essentials has also gone up with the decision to close small border crossings. Local administration on the Nepal side does not seem concerned over the high flow of people through the border. There are several health desks, but they are understaffed and under-equipped to monitor the travellers. ""We don't have any personal protective equipment such as protective suits, medical goggles, boots, gloves, and masks. Without them we are exposed to the threat of contracting the virus,"" said Khan, auxiliary health workers at the Krishnanagar border.The measure of social distancing to limit the spread of coronavirus is not being followed in border towns and villages of both Nepal and India. Man Kumari Gharti of Rolpa who was on her way to India with her family said he was more concerned about feeding his family than coronavirus. “The Indian side has been blaring out messages about the dangers of coronavirus but an empty stomach doesn't care much about any virus”, she said. “We are more concerned about dying of hunger than the virus.” Jagbir Buda of Surkhet also has a similar view about the coronavirus crisis. He, too, was travelling to India after visiting a sick relative. “While others are returning, I am going back. What options do I have if I stay here?” said Buda, whose entire family is in India for work.“I don't care about getting the virus. All I know is we have lived together and will die together if we contract the virus.” Chief District Officer of Kapilvastu Dirgha Narayan Poudel said they were preparing to close all small border crossings.In Nawalparasi, too, cross-border movement of people remains uninterrupted despite the travel advisory issued by the local administration. “We have appealed to the people to avoid non-essential travel and increased monitoring along the border. But there has not been much effect on the movement of people,” said Chief District Officer Basudev Dahal.In Bardiya, the local administration has not taken any steps to close the border crossings with India despite the threat of Covid-19.Chief District Office Prem Lal Lamichhane said his office did not have the authority to close the border with India. ""All we can do is urge people to avoid non-essential travels. We do not have the authority to close the border,"" said Lamichhane.The local administration of Banke also said that the decision to close down the border should come from the higher authority. “We are trying to contain the risks by discouraging people from travelling to India unless absolutely necessary. We cannot stop them from travelling at all,"" said Chief District Officer Kumar Bahadur Khadka.The district’s border screening measure is also lax. At the Jamunaha border point, the health desk set up by the local administration is severely understaffed and under-resourced. The health desk has only six staff compared to 20 on the Indian side. ""We are the ones with the highest risk of contracting the disease and we have no protective gear,” said Dhan Prasad Neupane, a health worker deployed at the health desk, which has so far referred five suspected coronavirus patients to Bheri Hospital.Meanwhile, the hospital itself is woefully underprepared to handle coronavirus cases. ""There are no facilities in the isolation wards. We don't have the facility or personnel to even take the samples from the suspected person and send them to the Capital for further testing,"" said Dr Prakash Bahadur Thapa, medical superintendent at the hospital. ""Even if we confirm someone with Covid-19, there is nothing we can do to treat the person.""The health desk set up by the Rupandehi local administration at Suthauli border point is also not up to the mark to screen the travellers for possible coronavirus inspection. The health desk is being manned by only two health workers. They usually come at 10 am and leave after 4 pm. All movements before 10am and after 4pm are not monitored. Chief District Officer Yogendra Bhagat said they have written to the supplies department of the provincial government to dispatch proper equipment at the border point. ""These equipment are single-use materials. They cannot be reused. But the administration has not sent us supplies,"" said Bhagat.(Thakur Singh Tharu from Bardiya, Madhu Shahi from Banke, Manoj Poudel from Kapilvastu, Madhav Dhungana from Rupandehi and Nabin Poudel from Parasi contributed to this reporting.)","Published at : March 21, 2020",Bhairahawa,Madhav Dhungana
Resunga and Madane forests sanctuaries for birds,"Resunga and Madane—both protected forests in the district of Gulmi—are major destinations for birding.According to conservationists, more than 25 percent of the total 886 bird species found in the country are spotted in Resunga and Madane forests. Of late, the bird species and their numbers have increased in the area owing to the conservation efforts of the locals in collaboration with the authorities concerned.“A total of 202 bird species were spotted in Resunga forest during the census held in 2015. Now 230 species of birds including some rare species are found in the area. The number of bird species has climbed to 258 from 207 some four years ago,” said Bharat Panthi, assistant project officer of Bird Conservation Nepal. According to him, locals, various organisations working in the conservation sector and the government authorities have been working in coordination to preserve the biodiversity in the area.In 2015, the government declared Resunga as a protected forest, including 11 community forests and some part of the national forest. Madane was also declared protected forest last year. Resunga and Madane forest cover 3,100 and 13,761 hectares of land respectively.Resunga forest lies just a few kilometres above Tamghas, the district headquarters of Gulmi, and Madane is around 50 kilometres west from Tamghas. “We have noticed an increase in the flow of birdwatchers in both Resunga and Madane of late,” said Panthi. Additionally, Resunga is an important habitat for vultures. Eight different vulture species including red-headed and Egyptian vultures are found homing in tall trees in Resunga.The hilly forests are suitable habitats for several bird species as there are natural water sources in the area. The division forest office has constructed ponds in the protected forest for preserving biodiversity. “We constructed two ponds in Resunga and one in Madane so that the birds and other animals get easy access to water throughout the year,” said Madan Dhungana, assistant forest officer.The Division Forest Office and the Bird Conservation Nepal have launched several awareness programmes in the protected forest areas to encourage people’s participation. “Earlier, the locals were nonchalant about the wildlife in the forest. But with the government giving the protected status to the forests, locals have started taking interest in the conservation of biodiversity,” said Junga Bahadur Kunwar, chairman of Resunga Community Forest Users’ Group.","Published at : March 20, 2020",Gulmi,Birendra KC
Chhipridaha lake in Rukum (East) on the verge of extinction,"Nicknamed as Baunna Pokhari Tripanna Takuri (place of 52 ponds and 53 hills), Rukum—now divided into Rukum (East) and Rukum (West) for the federal ruling system—has many beautiful lakes and ponds. One among them is Chhipridaha, which is situated at ward No. 6 of Sisne Rural Municipality in Rukum (East). The pond now lies almost dry, buried and on the verge of extinction.“Chhipridaha is our identity; it holds historical significance. But the pond is gradually drying up and is struggling to survive. The people’s representatives, concerned authorities and even the locals are indifferent towards the conservation of the pond,” said Bharat Budhathoki. The water level in the pond has decreased sharply—so much that the water body has nearly dried up. The locals throw garbage in the pond area that covers around 15 ropanis of land. The roadside drainage of the local market also flows into the pond, which is gradually getting buried.Tall buildings have been constructed around the pond. One can see heaps of plastics, papers, bottles, rubber goods and shards of broken pots around the pond, according to Budhathoki.“The pond site used to be wide, full of water and beautiful. It will die if the people’s representatives and the authorities do not take immediate action to preserve it,” said Bhakta Bahadur Khatri, a nonagenarian of Chhipridaha Bazaar.The rural municipality allocated Rs 600,000 for the pond’s conservation in the last fiscal year, which was spent on building a wall around the pond. But the local unit has yet to come up with any concrete plans to preserve the pond.“The rural municipality in the current fiscal has allocated funds to prepare a detailed project report for the lake’s conservation. We will earmark the necessary funds for the pond’s conservation and take other steps based on the detailed project report,” said Kumari Baral, the chairperson of Sisne Rural Municipality.","Published at : March 19, 2020",Rukum (east),Hari Gautam
Poor waste management affects people of Siddharthanagar,"Laxmi Acharya of Siddharthanagar Municipality Ward No. 9 has been struggling to manage her household waste for the past week.“Garbage collectors haven’t come to pick up waste in the last week. Sacks of waste are lying at our house, giving a foul smell,” said Acharya. Like Archarya, every household in Siddharthanagar Municipality is facing a similar problem.The municipality had been dumping garbage at the Paklihawa area, which lies in the border of Siddharthanagar Municipality Ward No. 1 and 2. But locals of Paklihawa have been stopping garbage tractors from disposing of waste at the area, citing that haphazard disposal of garbage has affected the environment. Ramesh Malla, ward chairman of Siddharthanagar Municipality Ward No. 1, said many residents of Paklihawa have been affected by the unmanaged garbage disposal system. “The area has been greatly polluted by the garbage. Locals have been demanding us to address the issue,” said Malla.There are more than 15,000 households in Siddharthanagar. Piles of garbage have popped up in every street of the municipality, posing serious public health risks. Dr Rajendra Kumar Giri, chief at the District Health Office in Rupandehi, said, “Unmanaged garbage increases the risk of people getting various diseases like diarrhoea and typhoid.” The municipality produces around 35 to 40 quintals of garbage on a daily basis. Hari Prasad Adhikari, the municipality mayor, said his office has been holding discussions with the locals and concerned stakeholders to address the problem. “Waste management has become a serious problem not only in Sidhharthanagar but in the entire district,” said Adhikari. “All local units should work together to find a solution to the problem.” Three years ago, the municipality had planned to construct an advanced waste processing centre in Patkhauli to manage waste. But locals and leaders of various political parties protested against the proposal and the plan was cancelled.","Published at : March 17, 2020",Bhairahawa,Madhav Dhungana
Trees cut down to construct smart toilets in Nawalparasi (West),"More than a hundred trees in Parijat Community Forest, which is adjacent to the East-West Highway, have been felled in Bardaghat, Nawalparasi (West), to construct smart toilets, locals said.Until now, 119 trees in around two bighas of the forestland have been chopped down. The forest site is the area selected by the Province 5 government to construct smart toilets. Forest officials said the provincial government had requested the local unit to provide space for the construction. “Bardaghat Municipality had demanded that we provide them land to build toilets,” said Chudamani Bhandari, chairman of the Parijat Community Forest Users Group. “We are clearing the forest to provide land for the municipality.” However, locals complained that on Saturday, an unidentified group chopped down trees in the forest in broad daylight. “It’s not the forest users who chopped the trees on Saturday. We are looking into the incident,” said Bhandari.The community forest was planning to allocate some land for the toilet construction through its 21st Annual General Meeting in accordance with the Forest Act-2019. “The trees are being cut down haphazardly on the pretext of constructing smart toilets. It’s against the rules and forest regulations,” said Division Forest Officer Ram Narayan Shah.Meanwhile, Bardaghat Municipality Mayor Dhiraj Sharma said his office had asked the community forest for a land plot to construct smart toilets as per the programme of the provincial government. “Many trees have been cut down along the Butwal-Narayangadh section for the expansion of the East-West Highway,” said Sharma. “We suspect that some of the locals might have chopped down trees upon seeing the Division Road Office workers doing that along the road.”The federal Ministry of Forest and Environment had granted permission to cut down around 46,000 trees along the Butwal-Narayangadh section.","Published at : March 15, 2020",Parasi,Nabin Paudel
Province 5 assembly members debate over the province’s name and capital,"Province 5 is scrambling to decide its capital city and province name as all other provinces have already decided their capitals. Amidst the mounting pressure from locals and people’s representatives, a multiparty meeting—comprising of representatives from prominent political parties, entrepreneurs, and members from civic society—took place in Butwal last week. The meeting, however, failed to make any headway.Even though the people’s representatives raise the issue in each meeting, the provincial assembly has yet to discuss a report submitted by the Capital City Recommendation Committee three months ago.There are three cities that being discussed for the provincial capital—Butwal, Kapilvastu and Dang. Locals and representatives have been lobbying to name their respective native cities as the provincial capital. But the issue hasn’t propelled forward despite repeated meetings and heated debates. The solution is not in immediate sight, say provincial ministers and stakeholders.Speaking at a meet-up in Butwal on Sunday, Kul Prasad KC, provincial minister of internal affairs and law, said the capital city would be decided through a ‘competition’ and may take some months. “This is a very sensitive issue that would have a long-lasting impact,” he said. “We should make the decision respecting the soul and objective of federalism.”KC also criticised the previous government’s decision to name Butwal as temporary capital as ‘knee-jerk’, adding that the government is yet to receive reports from Special Committee and Technical Committee, which are tasked with researching the viable options for the capital city. “There are three major cities in Province 5, so it’s not an easy decision,” he said. “We would have to respect the opinions of the people and experts.”Likewise, speaking at the function organised by Reporters’ Club, provincial assembly member Bhoj Prasad Shrestha said the province’s capital should be a well-connected city with ample access to infrastructure and facility. Such a city, Shrestha said, is Butwal. “Assigning Butwal as the province capital would benefit a majority of the province’s population,” Shrestha claimed. “Butwal would make for an ideal capital given that it is well-connected, has access to infrastructure, and has possibilities of high growth and development.”Meanwhile, Fakaruddhin Khan, a provincial assembly member representing Nepali Congress, said the fact that the assembly is still struggling to resolve the issue is a “serious shortcoming of the existing government.”“This is an issue that should’ve been concluded within six months of the establishment of the provincial assembly,” he said. “It is a shame that two years on, the government has failed to make any headway. This has questioned the objective of federalism itself.”Santosh Pandey, another provincial member, said the government has been confusing people, saying the capital should be set up on virgin land. “We will not tolerate any federal interference in this matter,” Pandey said.The provincial assembly has 87 members—61 from Nepal Communist Party, 19 from Nepali Congress, five from Samajbadi Party, and one each from Rastriya Janamorcha and Rastriya Janata Party. According to existing provisions, the decision to designate the capital and name of the province would be passed through the two-third majority of the assembly.Recently, Bagmati Province endorsed Hetauda as its capital; all other provinces have already decided on their capital, while Provinces 1, 2 and 5 are yet to endorse their province names. Currently, Butwal stands as the temporary capital city of Province 5.","Published at : March 12, 2020",Rupandehi,Ghanashyam Gautam
Development projects in Gulmi face a number of obstacles,"In April last year, a 55metre-long motor bridge—worth Rs54million—in Badigarh collapsed while it was under construction. Jay Buddha Construction took the contract for the construction of the bridge in July 2016, pledging to complete it within two years. Several deadlines have been extended since, but the bridge has yet to complete. Likewise, there are at least a dozen bridges costing millions of rupees that lie incomplete after years of deadline extensions.Development projects such as bridge and road constructions in the district have been in limbo for years. Deadlines have been extended repeatedly with no results to be seen. Locals blame the contractors of doing substandard work. On the face of it, the local units seem indifferent.Ram Lal BK, chair of Ruru Chhetra Rural Municipality Ward No. 1, said that several development projects have been launched to promote tourism in the district. “The work is progressing at snail’s pace, if at all,” he said. “These projects are important as they can contribute to the district’s tourism.”Sub-engineer at the bridge department of the District Road Infrastructure Office Gopal Bahadur Thapa said that contractors would be fined if they don’t complete the project within the deadline. “But since the contractors come up with multiple excuses, we have had to comply with their demands for deadline extensions,” he said.If the condition of bridge projects in the district is bad, that of road projects is worse. The construction of the Ridi-Rundrabeni road section started three decades. The section is yet to be gravelled completely. Only about 40km of the section is either blacktopped or gravelled, but the finished work has started to fall apart, with the road developing potholes. The contractor, Rautaha Harihari Company, was supposed to complete the gravelling by August 2017, but the road lies incomplete even today, after multiple deadline extensions and change of contractors.Chief of the Road Infrastructure Office Gopi Raj Pun Magar pointed out several reasons—such as poor management of the project by the contractor companies and a lack of workforce—behind incomplete works. “We monitor every project in the district,” he said. “But the contractor companies come with excuses, and some of them are valid.”But Hari Kumar Shrestha, secretary of Construction Entrepreneurs’ Association, pointed out more insidious reasons behind the infrastructure fiascos. “The local units open tender only towards the end of a fiscal year,” he said. “Then the contractors have to go through several hurdles—a lack of funds, labour force and raw material.”And even if the work is done in time, there is no assurance regarding its quality for lack of robust monitoring, said Lakshman Parajuli, chief of District Coordination Committee. “The contractors take up projects more than their capacity, then they lack enough manpower, and the budget is not disbursed in time,” he said. “There are problems in the government side as well: they lack a technical team to monitor the ongoing projects.”Photo: The under-construction Nistikhola Bridge.","Published at : March 10, 2020",Gulmi,Birendra KC
Lumbini’s tourism hit hard amid novel coronavirus scare,"Lumbini Peace Marathon, which was scheduled to take place on Monday, was cancelled on Sunday amid widespread fear of the novel coronavirus disease that has spread across the world. Over 100 participants had signed up for this year’s marathon that has been taking place for the past four years. The event was cancelled following the local unit’s directive to postpone any event that involves a large gathering of people.“Monday is an important day for Buddhists, for it commemorates the day the Buddha returned to Kapilvastu after his enlightenment,” said Bikram Pandekaji, who organised the marathon four years ago. “We have been organising the marathon every year to mark the historical event, but this year, we are sad to report that we had to postpone it.”Likewise, several other events of adventure sports have also been cancelled. Among them is the 77km cycle race, for which over 70 cyclists had signed up. At a time when adventure tourism is drawing an unprecedented number of tourists to the historic town, the global spread of the virus is worrying, said Sikhar Pandey, director of the cycle race. “The three-day race has been immensely successful over the years, but, sadly, this year we had to postpone it,” Pandey said. “We will reorganise it once the situation becomes favourable.”Along with the marathon and cycle race, at least a dozen events have been cancelled in the town over the past week. This has meant that the city would lose thousands of tourists, said Lilamani Poudel, general secretary of Lumbini Hotel Association.“This is an ideal season for adventure tourism, so there were over a dozen programmes in the pipeline guaranteeing to draw thousands of tourists,” Poudel said. “But the fear of the global virus has spelt disaster to the city’s tourism business.”","Published at : March 10, 2020",Kapilvastu,Manoj Poudel
A 51-year-old woman attacked with acid in Kapilvastu district,"A 51-year-old woman of Maharajgunj Bazaar in Kapilvastu district sustained severe burn injuries on her face and chest after her neighbour threw acid on her on Friday evening.Bedamati Devi Gupta, who was attacked by her neighbour Hari Narayan Barai following a spat, is receiving treatment at Universal College of Medical Sciences in Bhairahawa. Read: Regulate sale of acid, rights activists and attack survivors urge government“The victim is in critical condition. She cannot speak; she is communicating with the gesture of her hands,” said Dipesh Kharel, inspector of Ward Police Office in Chandrauta.The dispute arose over a broken cricket bat. Gupta’s son Yuvraj and Barai’s son Rahul, among other children, were playing cricket on the street on Friday evening when the latter’s bat broke. A quarrel among the children ensued, which was later joined by the guardians as well. According to Ashok Shribastav, sub-inspector of the Area Police Office in Maharajgunj, Gupta and Barai had a heated argument over the issue of providing compensation for the broken cricket bat.Read: Meet the acid attack survivor who challenged Nepal's laws to help others like herFollowing the argument, Barai, who is a battery mechanic, got the corrosive from his own shop and threw it on Gupta. She was immediately rushed to Taulihawa for treatment. But since her treatment was not possible there, Gupta was later taken to the Provincial Hospital in Butwal, which again referred her to Universal College of Medical Sciences.Security personnel on Saturday arrested Barai for investigation. Deputy Superintendent of Police Sunil Malla said an attempted murder charge has been filed against Barai. He will be presented to the Kapilvastu District Court on Monday to extend his remand.The incidents of acid attack on women are unchecked in the country.

Budget crunch halts construction of integrated settlement in Pyuthan,"An integrated model settlement being built by Naubahini Rural Municipality in Pyuthan for the impoverished families has hit a roadblock due to a lack of budget.The local unit had allocated Rs5million last fiscal year to build 22 houses for the families who cannot afford to build on their own. The decision was made in 2018 after the local unit deemed the impoverished families at Dandatol, in Ward No. 5, were at risk of landslide.But only 16 houses have been constructed so far. While some of them are incomplete and many lack toilets, drinking water and roads. The construction work has ground to a halt due to budget constraint, said Yam Bahadur Sunar, chair of the consumers’ committee that oversees the construction.The local unit has come under criticism from local leaders for opting to set up the settlement without conscious thought as the beneficiaries have not yet been granted land registration certificates. “The heart of the local unit’s campaign might be at the right place, but it lacked proper planning,” said Min Raj Rana, secretary of the consumers’ committee. “The current budget crunch is a result of that.”The local unit had announced that all the houses would be equipped with toilets, but that has not happened yet. “Severe budget shortfall has left many construction workers without wages,” Rana said. “We are unsure how the construction will move further.”This has led to confusion and frustration among the locals. “The local unit promised us a home within a year,” said Chuman Sunar, a local. “But things are not moving as another rainy reason is round the corner.”Thaneshwore Bhandari, chief administrative officer at the local unit, said that a total of Rs2.6million had been allocated for the project this year. “We are planning to estimate the required budget now and would pass it through a village assembly meeting soon.”Meanwhile, Shiva Rijal, chair of the rural municipality, said that his office is yet to finalise the names of the beneficiaries. “We will finalise it soon and allocate further budget,” he said. “We are committed to handing over the houses by the end of this year.”","Published at : March 4, 2020",Pyuthan,Giru Prasad Bhandari
"1,000 bighas of government land in Tulsipur, Dang have been taken over by illegal settlers: Study","A group of people have captured around 1,000 bighas of government land where an industrial estate was being planned at Tulsipur Sub-Metropolitan City in Dang district, a probe conducted by National Vigilance Centre has revealed.The land plots at Majgaun area along the Gwar stream in Ward 16 of Tulsipur were captured by some local villagers with the backing of local political leaders, officials at the centre and the city office said. According to the centre, an anti-graft body under the Prime Minister’s Office, a group of people who claimed themselves to be landless had captured the plots a year ago, when a bridge on Gwar stream was completed. The city authority had unsuccessfully tried to clear the land twice in the recent past, according to Tulsipur Deputy Mayor Maya Sharma. On May 2, 2019, the Tulasipur Sub-Metropolitan City Executive had decided to establish an industrial estate on the land that covers Ward 2, 3, 10, 13 and 16. The plot in Ward 16 has been captured by locals. “Many of those who have encroached the land had been farming at the bank of the stream for a long time,” said Sharma. “When the survey began for the bridge construction over the Gwar stream, some people started to claim ownership over some of the plots. After the local government decided to build the industrial zone, the land became valuable and people started erecting houses.”Around 1,000 bighas of land were encroached upon by locals this way. The government land has not just been encroached upon illegally, some plots have been purchased and sold as well, according to the report.The centre’s probe team was notified that even the member of the city executive, Deepak Kumal, had sold a plot to Lal Bahadur Sarki at Rs400,000. In addition to Sarki, Ishwori Bhandari, Hukum Khadka and Lal Bahadur B.K, have also purchased encroached plots. The centre’s probe failed to determine who had sold them the land. “As those who sold the land plots cannot provide land ownership certificates, they are selling the plots at half the market value,” said Deputy Mayor Sharma. But the vigilance centre said that the concerned authorities were not found to be accountable when the land plots were being encroached upon, sold and bought. On February 24, the centre decided to instruct the District Administration Office, Dang, and Tulasipur Sub-Metropolitan City to take measures to protect the public land from the encroachers, as they were responsible bodies for protecting the public land. Dalnath Aryal, assistant spokesperson for the centre, said the encroachment of government land was possible due to political backing. “It has been understood that they were encouraged to encroach the government land for political benefits,” he said.According to Sharma, local leaders of different political parties are backing the encroachers. According to her, the local government has floated a proposal of distributing one kattha land each to landless families and prioritising employment for the people living on encroached land if they vacate the place. “But there has been no consensus on the matter yet,” Sharma said. Some people accused of encroaching government land in Tulsipur have registered a complaint at the centre claiming that they, as landless people, should be allocated land. “We cannot ask the concerned authorities to distribute government land to landless people,” said Aryal.When the centre’s team visited the site of land encroachment recently, it found that the illegal settlers were building new homes there. The Office of Auditor General last year stated in its report that Around 66,000 square metres of public land—belonging to seven government offices—have been encroached upon by individuals. The encroached plots of land have been used for private housing and other purposes, the auditing body said in its performance audit report for the fiscal year 2017-18.","Published at : March 4, 2020",Kathmandu,Prithvi Man Shrestha
Conflict victims in Dang express their mistrust on Truth and Reconciliation Commission for justice,"The recently appointed officials of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission were in Tulsipur on Wednesday to hold an interaction programme with conflict-era victims. One of the attendees was Aasha Chaudhary, a resident of Katkuiya in Tulsipur, who was arrested by the police in 2000 for “being a Maoist”. The 15-year-old was kept in police custody for three months. After her release, the fourth-grader quit her studies, and she was married off by her guardians. It has been over a decade since the insurgency (1996-2006) ended, but Chaudhary still remembers her time in jail. The physical and mental torture she suffered at the hands of the police still haunts her. For Chaudhary and most of the attendees at the programme, the delivery of justice seems far-fetched. “What has the commission done in the past five years? I submitted an application to the commission four years ago. What became of it?” Chaudhary questioned the officials. “You ask us the same questions again and again to what end? We are tired of repeating our plight. Justice delayed is justice denied.” Sita Basnet of Dangisharan in Dang, who lost her husband in the insurgency, said she does not expect to get justice anymore. “There is no point in hosting these programmes. I came here hoping for concrete answers, but this has only succeeded in opening old wounds,” she said. “The perpetrators of the crime against us are in the government now. How is justice possible?”Khuma Budhathoki, whose son, a police officer, was killed by Maoist rebels, said such ‘meaningless’ programmes only made her recall the incident that changed her life.“There is little hope of justice for us. I will not attend these programmes henceforth,” said Budhathoki, a resident of Bijauri.The officials at the programme did not give any concrete answer to address the grievances of the victims. “We do technical work only. It’s the state’s responsibility to deliver justice to the victims. Ours is to do the groundwork,” said Ganesh Datta Bhatta, the chairman of the commission. Along with Bhatta, commission members Govinda Gautam, Bishnu Pokharel, Mana Dahal and Prachandaraj Pradhan were present at the programme.According to Bhatta, the commission received around 65,000 applications seeking justice. “The concerns of the victims must be addressed soon. We understand that if these problems remain unresolved, the conflict will be institutionalised,” said Bhatta.The Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons were formed in February 2015 to investigate the cases with gross human rights violation by both sides during the armed conflict, and to provide justice to the victims. The commissions were without staff since mid-April, 2019, as the officials were relieved of their duties after they failed to make effective progress in investigating war-era cases. Following an agreement between the ruling Nepal Communist Party and the primary opposition Nepali Congress in January 2020, a committee formed to recommend officials for the two transitional justice commissions has finalised 10 names for the commissions.Nepal’s transitional justice process has dragged on for more than a decade. The international community and human rights organisations have time and again called on the government to conclude the transitional justice process, but there has been a lack of political will.","Published at : March 2, 2020",Dang,Durga Lal KC
Locals start returning encroached forest land in Bardiya,"Twenty-two farmers from Chaudharipur and Gauripara villages in Badhaiyatal Rural Municipality, Bardiya, returned the encroached land of Tripura Community Forest two weeks ago.“The farmers cumulatively handed over eight bighas of land to the community forest,” said Dronaraj Sharma, assistant forest officer at the Division Forest Office in Bardiya. The locals of Badhaiyatal Ward No. 8 had formed a community forest users’ group for Tripura Community Forest a decade ago. But over the years, some locals have converted the forest land into their private properties.To free the encroached forest land, the community forest users’ group had recently organised various programmes and interactions in the area, as a result of which some locals agreed to return the land owned by the community forest.“I decided to return the land after I realised that conserving and protecting forests and their resources is important. Forests are an inseparable part of our life and we must protect them,” said Raju Chaudhary.Many farmers in the rural municipality have converted the forest land into agricultural fields. In Ward No. 6, approximately eight bighas of land belonging to Rihar Community Forest had been encroached by individuals, a temple and a campus. The encroached land was recently returned to the community forest.“Discussions were held for a long time regarding the encroached forest land. Finally, the people who had been using the land agreed to return the land. Even landless squatters have agreed to return the forest land,” said Ram Dulare Tharu, chairman of Rihar Community Forest Users’ Group.Similarly, around 10 bighas of encroached land were recovered by Doraha Community Forest in Butaha while Rambazaar Woman Community Forest in Gulariya Ward No. 4 has recouped one and a half bighas of encroached land. According to Sharma, nearly 372 hectares of the forest land in the district has been encroached upon by illegal settlers and farming community. Bardiya has a total of 21,700 hectares of forest land.  “A growing number of people are returning the encroached forest land. The forest office is helping the community forests to fence the returned forest land and to plant saplings,” Sharma said. Usually, it takes an intervention from the government authorities to recover encroached forest land. “What the community forest groups have done in Bardiya to recover the lost forest land is exemplary,” Sharma added.","Published at : February 29, 2020",Bardiya,Thakur Singh Tharu
Local authorities are encroaching on Nepalgunj ponds,"Several wards of Nepalgunj Sub-metropolis are found to be encroaching upon public lands to build their office buildings.The legendary Bhawani Pond, spread over three katthas of land, until a few years ago was a site for garbage disposal. But instead of conserving the pond, the ward. 7 office of the metropolis has started constructing one of its offices and a health post on the pond’s land. But it’s not just the local unit that has encroached upon public land; the locals are doing it too.The ward’s construction project recently ground to a halt after the locals protested against it, claiming that the land belonged to them, according to Ward Chair Jumman Khan.“There is a dearth of public land in the ward, so we had no option than to use the land of the pond,” he said. “But after the locals’ protests, we were compelled to stop the project until next year.” Meanwhile, the locals argue that the pond carries a rich history for them and its land should not be infringed upon.But this is not the only pond that is being encroached. Bhawani Baag lake in Nepalgunj Ward No. 11 is now a shell of its former self, with its water covered with mud. Here, too, the ward office is constructing an office.“We don’t need a lake in this place since we have plenty of others nearby,” said Mubarak Ali Siddiqui, a member of the ward. “Therefore, we are planning to construct an office building here, since the office is currently operating out of a rented flat.”Besides these two, there are many other lakes in Banke that have turned into either private properties or dumping sites. According to Sachchinanda Chaube, Nepalgunj has seven lakes and 12 ponds.“The rise in population and encroachment has made them shrink,” he said. “It would be great if we could save the remaining ones, but it seems unlikely.”The Nepalgunj Sub-metropolis is committed to conserving its lakes and ponds, according to Mayor Dhawal Shumsher Rana. It has turned the Rani Pond, which was left unattended for years, into a tourist spot. Rana envisions a tourism boom if the sources of still water could be preserved, as has happened in Rani Pond, and blames the ward offices of encroachment. “The ward offices haven’t been serious in preserving the ponds and lakes,” he said.But not all ward offices have been careless. Like Rani, Dhobi pond in Ramnagar in Nepalgunj-6 has also undergone a facelift. The pond, spread over six katthas of land, was renovated with Rs1 million, according to Samir Pratap Singh, ward chair. “We are seeking more funds from the government to beautify the lake further,” said Singh. “The lake would not only attract tourists but also be beneficial to local farmers for irrigation.”Rupa Gahatraj contributed reporting.","Published at : February 27, 2020",Banke,Madhu Shahi
Lack of breastfeeding rooms in Banke government offices inconveniences many,"A room near the women’s toilet in Nepalgunj Sub-metropolis’ office has been designated for breastfeeding. However, nobody uses the room, as it is bare, with no children-friendly infrastructure, and the air is permeated by the foul smell of the restroom next door.Shivaratri Chaudhary, an employee at the office and a mother of a five-month-old infant, said she has to breastfeed her baby multiple times a day, but she has yet to use the breastfeeding room. “The stink from the restroom is unbearable; I go up to the rooftop to feed my baby,” she said. “Breastfeeding on the rooftop is difficult in the rainy season.”The designated room for breastfeeding has never been used by nursing mothers, whether they be office employees or service seekers.Currently, three female employees of the sub-metropolis are new mothers. All three complained about not having a proper room to nurse their babies. Pabitra Puri, an employee with a six-month-old baby, said she brings her mother-in-law to the office to take care of her child. “I have to go up to the terrace to breastfeed my baby. I can’t keep my child with me in the office because we don’t have a children-friendly infrastructure,” said Puri.The nursing mothers at the office have been demanding that a suitable room be allocated for breastfeeding. Manju Pandey, chief at the women and child development unit of Nepalgunj Sub-metropolis, said, “The sub-metropolis has allocated Rs 100,000 in the current fiscal year to set up a breastfeeding room in the office. But we haven’t been able to do so because the office does not have a spare room.”The municipality has repeatedly assured female employees at the office of setting up a fully equipped breastfeeding room, but nothing has been done about it, said Pandey. According to Hari Prasad Pyakurel, the chief administrative officer of Nepalgunj Sub-metropolitan City, his team is looking for space on the office premises to set up a breastfeeding centre. Most government offices in all eight local units of Banke district do not have breastfeeding rooms, leaving female employees and service seekers in hardships. “We don’t have a breastfeeding room in the office. I go behind the office building to feed my baby,” said Sabita Chaudhary, an employee of Kohalpur Municipality.","Published at : February 26, 2020",Banke,Madhu Shahi
Banke Dalits discriminated against on Shivaratri festival,"On Friday, the Mankhola Shiva Mandir in Chisapani was surrounded by devotees marking the Shivaratri festival. The crowd, however, was composed predominantly of the so-called high-caste people, for the temple has a history of discrimination against the Dalits.On Friday, too, the Dalits overtly were discriminated against. Like yesteryears, they were barred from offering prayers to Lord Shiva.Laxmi Sarki, one of the devotees who were on the temple premises, said that she was denied from sitting on a mattress placed outside the temple. “They did not allow me to help arrange the pooja too,” she said. “I feel utterly humiliated.” Sarki said she has been humiliated like this for years.Chandra Sunar, also a Dalit, echoes Sarki. “We are discriminated against whenever there’s a religious function,” she said. “Do the gods and goddesses really classify Dalits from non-Dalits?”Chair of Baijanath Rural Municipality Ward. 1 Rup Bahadur Malla said that he is leading the fight to end the ostracisation of Dalits at the hands of the so-called high-caste people. “We are fighting for people from all communities to be included in religious gatherings and social functions,” Malla said. “We are trying to dismantle conservative beliefs that discriminate against the Dalits. But we still have a long way to go.”Malla said that the Temple Management Committee has decided to include people of all caste and creed in its functions. But the composition of the committee itself is not inclusive. The eleven-member committee does not have a single Dalit member.However, Chair of the committee Nil Bahadur Chhetri said the committee will soon be reshuffled. “The new committee will include people of all caste,” he said. “We will listen to all communities for the temple’s conservation and development.”Mankhola Shiva Temple, spread out over five bighas of land, regularly hosts yagnas and other religious functions, and utilises the collected funds for the temple’s development and conservation.","Published at : February 23, 2020",Nepalgunj,Rupa Gahatraj
Authorities’ apathy leaves Bardiya monuments in dilapidated state,"An ancient Shiva temple at Bakotiya in Badhaiyatal Rural Municipality is in a dilapidated condition and in desperate need of renovation. The design of the 40-foot temple has a striking resemblance to the ruins in Tilaurakot, where Gautam Buddha spent his princely life, and the Bhulbhulaiya Durbar of Lucknow, India. Alongside the temple is a well, which holds great historical and cultural significance for the Tharu community. However, the authorities concerned have shown little interest in the preservation of this ancient monument, locals say.“Information is scant on when the temple was built. Many believe it to be around 400-years-old,” said Ram Dayal Chaudhary, a local. “For generations, we have been visiting the temple to offer prayers. But now, the temple is on the verge of collapse as no one has made any effort to preserve the ancient structure.”Until a couple of years ago, locals say, the inscriptions on a stone slab at the temple were visible, but without conservation efforts, the writings have faded. “The inscriptions were in Pali language, but now the writings are not legible. The authorities must conduct a proper study to establish the construction date of the temple,” said Chaudhary.The Shiva temple is just one of the hundreds of ancient monuments in Bardiya district that is in dire need of renovation and preservation. The local government’s apathy towards the conservation of ancient shrines, temples, wells among other monuments of historic significance, has left the ancient structure in a dilapidated condition.“All these monuments, constructed by our ancestors, will be lost if immediate measures are not taken for their preservation,” said Bir Bahadur Chaudhary, a local of Bakotiya. “The authorities are busy renovating the monuments in the city areas but they have neglected the ancient structures in the villages.”Province 5 lawmaker Kaviram Chaudhary conceded the authorities’ lack of interest towards the conservation of many ancient monuments. “The government has failed to prioritise the preservation of these ancient monuments,” said lawmaker Chaudhary, “We will lose a part of our history if we fail to preserve them.”Locals also complained about the government’s indifference towards the preservation and study of Barbardiya. As per the local legends, Barbardiya is the burial place of 12 shepherds (herders) and has a historical link in the naming of the district making it one of the places of archaeological importance.“The local government has not prioritised the identification and study of these ancient places,” said Govinda Chaudhary, a Tharu leader, “It is deeply troubling that the federal and local governments have failed to conduct any sort of studies on these lands of archaeological importance.”","Published at : February 17, 2020",Bardiya,Thakur Singh Tharu
Province 5 government preparing master plan to upgrade Lumbini Provincial Hospital,"The Province 5 government is preparing a master plan to upgrade Lumbini Provincial Hospital in Butwal. The preliminary master plan envisages the construction of infrastructure that will allow the hospital to provide quick services to the patients.A 3D design of a 10-storey building with state-of-the-art facilities has been made public. The master plan is estimated to cost Rs 6 billion.“According to the master plan, a spacious building will be constructed with a rooftop helipad. An elevator will be installed that directly connects the emergency ward with the helipad,” said Ishwor Gautam, vice-chairman of the provincial planning commission. He claimed that the upgraded hospital would provide all specialist services to the patients. According to Gautam, suggestions and feedbacks regarding the hospital’s master plan have been collected from the stakeholders. “The final version of the master plan will be completed within a couple of weeks by incorporating the stakeholders’ suggestions and feedbacks. Then the detailed project report will be prepared. The commission (provincial planning commission) will carry out all the works of the hospital as it is a pride project of the provincial government,” he added.The government had established the six-bed hospital in Butwal around 100 years ago. The hospital has been operating out of an old building that was built 60 years ago. As per the master plan, the existing building will be demolished and a new building will be erected in its stead. The provincial government has prioritised the upgradation of the hospital. However, the plan has not progressed smoothly as the hospital’s property has been encroached upon by private homes and commercial buildings. As per the record available at the District Survey Office, the hospital currently owns about six bighas of land, though the land-ownership certificate issued in 1995 shows that the hospital owns eight bighas. The survey office said the hospital’s land was encroached upon time and again while expanding the highway and roads around it.The hospital has a total of 97 positions for doctors. However, posts of 15 specialist doctors and 42 medical officers are currently vacant. Social Development Minister Sudarshan Baral said that the government was preparing to fulfil the vacant posts. “We are planning to have volunteer employees so that the hospital won’t be a referral centre. The employees will be appointed on a permanent basis after the formation of the provincial public service commission,” said Baral. He said specialist services would be started in the hospital giving priority to neurology and orthopaedic services.","Published at : February 17, 2020",Butwal,Amrita Anmol
"Community forests in Bardiya encroached upon by squatters, local consumers","Landless squatters and local consumers have constructed houses by encroaching upon community forests in Bardiya, forest officials say.According to the data of the district’s Division Forest Office, a majority of the forest cover of 33 community forests has been encroached upon in the name of landless people, freed Kamaiyas (former bonded-labourers) and flood victims. Forest users say they cannot clear the forest area, as the encroachers are backed by political parties. Meanwhile, the squatters say they moved to the forest area 15 years ago, as they had nowhere else to go.“Various organisations, including government institutions, have also encroached upon the forestland for setting up their offices,” said Drona Sharma, information officer at the Division Forest Office.Community forests cover 19,079 hectares of forestland in the district, whereas national forests cover around 4,000 hectares.“Landless squatters, consumers of community forests and various governmental and non-governmental organisations have encroached upon more than 378 hectares of forestland in the district,” Sharma said.According to the Forest Act 1993, it is illegal to build infrastructures on forestland. But encroachers have been building structures in Bardiya’s forests for years now. In Madhuban Municipality, land belonging to Kisan Community Forest was donated to an organisation named Manab Kalyan and Saving Cooperatives. Seven shops and a three-room building have been constructed there. In the forestland of Ramnagar Community Forest, several shops, a Red Cross building, a health post, huts and hotels have been built by encroachers. In Bansgadhi Municipality, the Area Police Office building was constructed in the land of Saptidevi Community Forest. “Most of the organisations have constructed roads and buildings, and installed utility poles after grabbing the forest lands,” Sharma said.Officials at the Division Forest Office said the government should form a high-level commission to address the issue. Mohammad Kar Khan, a central member of the Federation of Community Forestry Users Nepal, said the rampant felling of trees might cause desertification of the district’s lands. “It is difficult to evict encroachers from the forestland,” said Khan, adding that it’s illegal to build infrastructures in the forestland according to the Forest Act 1993.","Published at : February 16, 2020",Bardiya,Kamal Panthi
Lumbini Provincial Hospital’s One-stop Crisis Management Centre is crippled by lack of infrastructure and staff,"The One-stop Crisis Management Centre has been in operation at the Lumbini Provincial Hospital since 2011-12. The centre’s objective is to facilitate rehabilitation of victims of gender-based and domestic violence by providing them with medical treatment, legal services, security—and even temporary shelter. But the centre is currently languishing, with the hospital management neither giving the facility the required attention nor the publicity.Sabitri, a victim of domestic violence, visited the crisis management centre on Wednesday, seeking medical treatment and legal support. When she asked health workers at the emergency ward where the centre was, they had no clue.“I explained to them that there should be a centre which provides help to victims of domestic and sexual violence,” Sabitri told the Post. She preferred to reveal only her first name in order to protect her privacy. “I was told to contact the hospital administration. The administration asked me to wait in a room near the labour ward. I waited for about an hour; nobody came. The hospital staff did not know what to do with me. They didn’t even know that the hospital had such a facility.”Usually, survivors of domestic and sexual violence are referred to the centre by police, but they can also directly reach such centres. Here they often face difficulties due to the lack of awareness even among those who are supposed to operate the facility. Puja, a resident of Milan Chowk, went through a similar experience when she visited the centre on December 2, 2019. She had a letter from the Area Police Office, roamed inside the hospital and kept looking for health workers, for nearly two hours.“They did not care about me even after I showed the letter from the police,” said Puja. “It was difficult to find a nurse. It took a lot of time for the doctor to come and provide treatment.”Jamuna Panthi, the focal person of the centre, agrees that the centre has not been able to provide the services needed by the victims. According to her, a major reason behind this apathy is “lack of awareness among the health workers”. “The centre does not have staff who understand the purpose of running such a centre,” said Panthi. “They don’t know the guidelines and they are not trained specifically to run the centre. Only when a patient has a reference letter from the police does the staff come forward to help them.” Lack of qualified and dedicated personnel and minimum facilities in terms of infrastructure is another major reason why the victims have a hard time availing of the services.According to the One-stop Crisis Management Centre manual, the centre must have one medical officer, three staff nurses, one psycho-social counsellor, one facilitator, one woman police sub-inspector or assistant sub-inspector and a volunteer who is appointed in coordination with the local non-government organisations working in the field of violence against women.However, the provincial hospital’s centre only has a physician who is on-call duty and two nurses who are also assigned other hospital duties, but absolutely no staff required for the operation of the centre.Sunita, 16, of Devdaha, Sukrauli, is a rape survivor. When she reached the centre for an abortion earlier last month, she immediately started regretting.“It was very difficult; I did not know who I should first speak to. There was no one to listen to me and understand my problem. Nor was there any doctor to address my problem,” said Sunita, whose last name the Post decided against mentioning for privacy reasons. Moreover, the centre lacks the minimum facilities for operation, which include three dedicated rooms for treatment and examination, an office, a guard room and a toilet. Though the provincial hospital is one of the well-equipped facilities in the region, it has not prioritised One-stop Crisis Management Centre (OCMC) services. At the moment, the abuse victims are admitted, examined and given counselling in a dreary old room, with a broken window.Other necessary facilities like furniture, laboratory equipment and amenities like computer, printer and a telephone and curtains to maintain the confidentiality of the victim during forensic examination are also missing.“The centre lacked the privacy I needed in order to express myself. It was difficult to answer the questions when so many people were around in a single room,” said Sunita.As per the hospital data, on average, 15 service seekers visit the OCMC every month, a majority of them minors and young girls who have been sexually abused or raped. A majority of the women who visit the facility are victims of domestic abuse, according to the hospital.Dr Rajendra Prasad Khanal, the medical superintendent at the hospital, conceded that the OCMC has not been as effective as it should have been. “It’s largely because of the weak physical infrastructure at the hospital as well as the lack of a wide range of services that a regional hospital needs to provide for the victims on a day-to-day basis,” Khanal told the Post. Women’s rights activist Gyanu Poudyal said the dire state of the centre has been an obstacle in providing justice to the victims of sexual abuse and gender-based violence. “The centre, by not being able to provide information, service, counselling and help to the victims has made delivering justice to the victims much more difficult,” said Poudyal.","Published at : February 16, 2020",Butwal,Amrita Anmol
Farmers in Geruwa municipality accuse the Bardiya National Park of encroaching on their farmlands,"The Geruwa river in Bardiya is notorious for changing its course more than once in a year, especially during the wet season. Last monsoon, the river changed its course and inundated the farmland of Kamal Regmi, a farmer of Geruwa Municipality. Regmi is now landless because soon after the water level receded, the Bardiya National Park fenced the area claiming it to be the park’s land.The river, an offshoot of the Karnali River, has been gradually changing its course towards the western side because of silt formation. According to the record of the District Land Revenue Office, the border of the national park has been fixed up to the western part of Geruwa river. Because of this, the park claims the land that surfaces after bank erosion as its property. Locals like Regmi have knocked the municipality’s doors with their complaints of being left landless by the park several times. “The river has been eroding our fields on the western side little by little every year and the national park has been claiming our registered land plots as its property,” said Regmi. However, Ananath Baral, chief conservation officer of the park, said the record of the District Land Revenue Office showed that the western part of Geruwa river is the border of the national park. “Farmers have started to lodge complaints citing that the national park has grabbed their land plots. We are discussing with them to find a solution to the issue,” said Baral.According to Geruwa Municipal Office, more than 500 bighas of paddy fields have been included in the territory of the national park after riverbank erosion over the years. Jamuna Singh KC, mayor of Geruwa Municipality, said farmers have land ownership certificates with them to prove their claim on the land. “The rural municipality has taken initiatives to ensure that the farmers get their land plots back from the national park,” said KC. So far, more than 200 farmers in the local unit have already lost their cultivable lands to the erosion caused by the Geruwa river and the alleged encroachment of private land by the national park. “The national park has been gradually encroaching our lands. Every year, the river has been eroding its bank, gulping up our land, and the national park has been constructing electric fences to keep us off,” said Ramdulare Chaudhary, a farmer in Geruwa.","Published at : February 13, 2020",Bardiya,Thakur Singh Tharu
"In Butwal, settlements have been built over mounds of garbage thrown in the banks of Tinau","For years, the Butwal Sub-metropolis has been disposing of its garbage on the banks of Tinau River for lack of a dumping site. Once a certain area of the bank is filled with garbage, it gets encroached upon, and there sprouts a settlement.Hattisudh, in Ward No. 11 of Butwal Sub-metropolis, for instance, was a deserted area just about seven years ago, with its ground inundated by floods over the years. Then in 2015, the sub-metropolis started dumping its garbage in the area. The site is now filled with garbage with a settlement built over it.“Wherever there’s a space covered with garbage and mud, there emerges a settlement,” said Suresh Gautam, an official with the sub-metropolis’ garbage management unit. “Currently, there’s a dearth of space to throw garbage in, as all the open spaces now have a settlement.” Five years ago, there were 20 households in Hattisudh; today, there are 135.“We didn’t have anywhere to go, so we set up our homes here,” said Shakuntala Nepali, a local. “We used to collect recyclable wastes here, and then we made our homes.” Nepali’s family, who hails from Pyuthan, came to Butwal in 1997. “At first the entire area would stink,” she said. “But now we are accustomed to it.”The banks of Tinau have today turned into a haven for those who can’t afford to rent a flat in the city. “Since my husband is the sole breadwinner in the family, we struggle to make a living,” said Tara Sunar, another Hattisudh local who has a family of five. “The burden has eased a bit since we don’t have to pay rent these days.”Today, the locals of Hattisudh and Pavitranagar, another settlement of 250 households established over mounds of garbage, argue the sub-metropolis should stop disposing of its waste in their burgeoning settlement. The locals of Pavitranagar have repeatedly protested against the sub-metropolis for throwing garbage in the area.“Many settlements in Butwal were established on the banks of the river,” said Ramsingh Thapa, a Pavitranagar local. “So the sub-metropolis should refrain from throwing garbage in the settlement area.”Meanwhile, in settlements such as Sundarnagar, the local unit has provided the residents with electricity and drinking water facilities. Sundarnagar, where only 15 labourers resided until 2005, today teems with 200 concrete houses.Mayor Shivaraj Subedi said his office has imposed a rule that restricts the construction of new houses in Sundarnagar. “We couldn’t stop the land encroachment until last year,” he said. “From this year on, we will not let anybody new encroach upon the public space.”Meanwhile, Butwal today faces a crisis in garbage management. The sub-metropolis sees 53 ton of garbage per day. But protests from the locals, political wrangling, and an under-equipped local unit to deal with the problem have deepened the crisis. The construction of a permanent waste processing centre was planned 15 years ago. A five-hectare space in Shivanagar was chosen as the site for the centre. The centre was supposed to be constructed by 2015 with the aid of the Asian Development Bank. But the locals of Charange, a settlement nearby Shivanagar, protested against the centre’s construction. The locals haven’t budged, and thus, the project today is caught in a limbo. Meanwhile, the solution to Butwal’s crisis of waste management is nowhere near sight.","Published at : February 8, 2020",Rupandehi,Amrita Anmol
Scientific forest management in a community forest helps locals of Shitaganga Municipality become self-employed,"A couple of years ago, Seema Gurung was worried about meeting her household expenses. She didn’t have a source of income and her husband would take on odd jobs to earn a living. But things took a turn for the better for Gurung and her family when Dhirikhola Community Forest adopted the Scientific Forest Management Framework, opening doors to employment for the residents of Bhangala.Since the community forest in Shitaganga Municipality adopted the new approach a few years ago, it has enabled local residents to earn an income from forest resources. “My husband and I are employed in the forest. We help conserve the forest and earn enough to sustain our livelihood,” said Gurung. Gurung makes firewood and prunes trees while her husband logs trees and constructs fire lines to conserve the forest from bushfires. Under the Scientific Forest Management Framework, a community forest takes steps to improve depleting forest quality and productivity and to harness the true economic potential of forest resources with the involvement of locals. Like Gurung, 270 individuals of 32 families in Bhangala have found employment in the community forest. Forest officials said that the scientific forest approach enables the locals to reap economic, social and environmental benefits from the forest. According to Jitendra Singh Khadka, division forest officer, his office has improved the forest quality and has increased its productivity by adopting the Scientific Forest Management Framework. “Users prune mature trees, cut old ones and replace them with new saplings so that they can contribute to the regeneration and sustainability of the forests,” said Khadka.The community forest, which spreads in around 126 hectares, has brought changes in the lifestyle of forest consumers. Every consumer receives Rs 750 as a daily wage for planting tree saplings, logging trees and loading logs onto vehicles, among other works. The cumulative income of the forest is Rs 10 million annually, which comes mostly by selling timber and firewood. “Locals can also take loans from the forest office to start businesses like vegetable farming, goat keeping, poultry and pig and buffalo farms, among others,” said Khadka.Forest officials have also appointed five forest guards to take care of the forest. “We have been distributing works and have given the locals the responsibilities to take care of the forest and its resources,” said Narayan Bhusal, chairman of the forest consumers group. “Consumers themselves are involved in planting tree saplings, logging trees and loading logs onto vehicles.”The villagers have also constructed irrigation canals and drinking water projects and upgraded rural roads from the forest’s income. Five other community forests in Shitaganga are also on their way to adopting Scientific Forest Management Framework like Dhirikhola Community Forest. Buddha and Banaganga Community Forests are awaiting permission from the Division Forest Office to adopt the Scientific Forest Management process. “We have already completed all of the due processes to adopt scientific forest management in our community forest,” said Maya Baijali, the chairperson of Banaganga Forest Consumers Group.According to the scientific forest management framework, there should be only 100 trees in one hectare of forestland. “More than a hundred trees in one hectare means that the area is too small for trees to grow healthy. That’s why scientific management of forest is necessary for the proper development of trees. Every 10 years, we can make a new work plan for scientific forest management,” said Khadka.","Published at : February 4, 2020",Arghakhanchi,Birendra KC
Province 5 government takes initiatives to conserve wetlands,"As most natural sources of water are drying up, the Province 5 government has taken initiatives to conserve wetland areas across the province. In coordination with the Provincial Ministry of Industry, Tourism, Forest and Environment, the local units in all 12 districts of the province have commenced works to preserve the existing wetlands and create new ones.As many as 116 ponds have been constructed in the province in the first phase of the drive. “Lakes and ponds in the area are gradually drying up. Hence we started this drive to conserve the existing ponds and dig new ones,” said Lila Giri, the provincial minister for Industry, Tourism, Forest and Environment. “Wetland conservation helps to preserve the ecosystem and even control rampant forest fires in the dry season.”The Province 5 government had allocated Rs 43.6 million in the fiscal year 2018/2019 to conserve wetlands. It constructed 116 ponds in Pyuthan, Rupandehi, Gulmi, Kapilvastu, Rolpa, Palpa, Bardiya, Nawalparasi (West), Banke, Arghakhanchi and Rukum (East). According to the ministry, the newly built ponds have the capacity of storing 5,200 cubic metres of water.“The division forest office of each district built the ponds in the last fiscal year. The ponds’ construction has had a positive impact on wetland conservation,” said Tukaraj Pandey, an officer at the ministry. According to Pandey, the ministry, in coordination with the local bodies, local conservation clubs and other organisations, has prepared working guidelines to carry out various conservation programmes. Under the programme, the ministry will develop forests in 10 towns and launch a pro-poor leasehold forest reform programme through 165 consumers’ groups in the current fiscal year. The ministry is also promoting medicinal herb farming in 61 different places in the province.Various local units in the province have also launched conservation campaigns. Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City has launched a conservation drive with a plan of constructing at least a pond in every community forest of the sub-metropolis. “Water sources are gradually drying up, so we have initiated a conservation campaign to conserve water sources,” said Mayor Shivaraj Subedi.","Published at : February 3, 2020",Butwal,Amrita Anmol
Children of conflict victims deprived of scholarship provided by the state,"Ajuri Lodh, 45, of Rayapur in Rupandehi lost her husband, Shyam Sundar, to the decade-long armed insurgency that took place between 1996 to 2006. She was left with five children who are now in their teens; her oldest is 18 and the youngest 14. For Lodh, sending her children to school has always been a priority but the help the state extends to families of conflict victims does not cover education expenses for all her five children. “The state provides scholarships to a maximum of three children per couple,” she said. “My two younger children are not eligible for the scholarship provided by the government.”Under the government’s scholarship scheme, a child of a conflict-era victim studying in the primary level receives Rs 10,000 annually while those in the lower secondary, secondary and higher secondary receive Rs 12,000; 14,000 and 16,000 respectively.According to the data available at the District Administration Office in Rupandehi, there are a total of 532 children of conflict victims in the district. The authority said that nearly 50 of them are deprived of the government scholarship.As per the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act 2014, a child of a conflict victim receives the government’s scholarship amount until he or she turns 18. However, in most cases, higher education begins at 18. “I am 15 years old and study in grade 9. I will turn 18 before I reach grade 12, after which I’ll be disqualified for the scholarship,” said Rajib Kafle, whose father was killed during the conflict. “I see no hope for my future if I have to discontinue my formal education.”At a discourse programme on the government’s plan to amend the scholarship provision under the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act 2014, conflict victims demanded the removal of the age limit and the number of children eligible for the scholarship.“The existing laws in the country do not have any provisions regarding the number of children one can bear, so the number limit for the scholarship makes no sense. The prevailing provision for the scholarship is an injustice to large families,” said Urmila Kunwar, who also lost her husband in the conflict.Hari Singh Dhami, the undersecretary at the provincial Ministry of Internal Affairs and Law, admits that there are legal hurdles stopping some children of conflict-era victims from receiving scholarships. “We have recommended the authorities to address the problem while amending the act,” said Dhami.The wives of disappeared people have also complained that the act is not “conflict-victim friendly”. Many of these women claim that they have not received the allowance meant for single women, as the state does not recognise the wives of disappeared people as single women. “We are under tremendous financial pressure; we are left with children and the state has done little to support us. The act should be amended so that we can also be eligible to get the allowance for single women,” said Dhana Chaudhary of Shuddodhan.Province 5 was hit hardest by the armed insurgency. A total of 3,221 people from 12 districts of the province were killed while 712 were disappeared and 94 others were maimed. As many as 805 people were killed in Rolpa alone, the epicentre of the armed conflict.","Published at : January 28, 2020",Butwal,Amrita Anmol
Schools in Rupandehi local unit are not ready for mandatory English teaching,"Farhan Ansari is a second-grader at Sirjana Basic School in Omsatiya Rural Municipality. The school incorporated English medium teaching a year ago. But Ansari cannot speak English, bar a few words.“He can’t read his English textbooks and is getting weaker at studies by the day,” said Mohammed Ansari, Farhan’s father.Bhojpuri is the mother tongue of a majority of students in the basic school. The students were just learning Nepali after they got enrolled in the school. But with the incorporation of regular English medium teaching, students have found themselves trapped in between three languages.But the problem is not faced by students alone. The teachers at the school, habituated in teaching in Nepali for years, are finding it hard to teach their pupils properly. “For many of the teachers, English is an uncomfortable language,” said Rama Chaudhary, a teacher at the school. “And when that is the condition of the teachers, what could one ask from the students?”Chaudhary said that the locals prefer sending their children to English medium schools. “For them, English language is a symbol of class,” said Chaudhary. “The school complied and this is where we are now.”Omsatiya Rural Municipality has 15 public schools, all of which adopted English medium teaching from the fiscal year 2018/19. Currently, the schools provide English medium teaching to students up to grade two.Hariprasad Pokhrel, education officer at the rural municipality, admitted that the teachings at the local unit’s public schools have not been up to the mark. “The new step was taken without making provisions for trained English medium teachers,” he said, referring to it as the root of the problem. “The teachers themselves have a hard time teaching in English. The move has been counterproductive: we thought it would enhance the quality of education but what happened is just the opposite.”The rural municipality provides free course books to students up to grade two and has hired 20 teachers to teach English. And the local unit has spent over Rs6 million to train the teachers.Heera Kebat, chair of the local unit, said that his office started English medium teaching since English is an international language and learning it would help students in the long run. “We will now find ways to improve the quality of English education,” Kebat said.But not everybody is convinced by Kebat’s reasoning.“People need to let go of the mentality that English medium teaching would produce talented students,” said Haribahadur Bista, education officer at the provincial directive of education and social development. “Primary level education should be provided in one’s mother tongue. If not, there’s Nepali, the country’s most-spoken language. It’s not necessary to force English down the students’ throats.”","Published at : January 26, 2020",Rupandehi,Amrita Anmol
Madrasa students cannot sit for Secondary Education Examination for lack of syllabi,"Farhan Alam is a 10th grader at Jame Sirajul Uloom Al-Safia, a madrasa (Muslim educational institute) in Kapilvastu. But Alam may not be able to appear for the Secondary Education Examination this year, as his school is yet to receive permission from the Office of the Controller of Examinations to conduct the exams. Like Alam, the fate of 60 other students hangs in the balance.Madrasas in Nepal used to be religious institutions until 2004 when the government started registering them and had them adopt the Nepali curriculum while allowing them to continue as institutions of religious learning. However, the federal government has only finalised the syllabi for grades four and five. The syllabi for grades 6 to 10 have been designed but are yet to be finalised, according to Maulana Mahasud Khan, general secretary of Rastriya Madrasa Sangh. Since the madrasas do not have syllabi, their students are not qualified to sit for board examinations conducted by the state. The madrasas have been conducting classes till grade 10, as they were given permission by local units to run classes till the secondary level. The local units, however, have not made the provision to qualify the students of madrasas to sit for Secondary Education Examination. The Office of the Controller of Examinations, which is under the federal government, decides which schools are qualified to conduct board examinations.“We have been frequenting various government agencies to seek permission to allow our students to sit for board examinations,” said Abdul Gani Alqufi, maulana of Jame Sirajul Uloom Al-Safia. “This logistic quandary has deprived the children of madrasas of further education prospects.” The madrasa, which was established a century ago, has 1,027 students.Similarly, the students of madrasa Maditul Olumaharpur in Nawalparasi (West) are also facing the same problem. Pratappur Rural Municipality had granted permission to the madrasa to conduct classes up to grade nine but the ninth graders weren’t allowed to fill the required form for Secondary Education Examination this year. Muwaraha Ahamad, a ninth grader at the madrasa, fears that he will not be able to appear for the board examination next year. “We could not fill the form this year. We don’t know whether we can appear for the boards next year or not,” he said. Nineteen students, including Ahamad, had appeared in an examination conducted by the local unit in grade 8. They had followed the syllabi of the madrasas in India. “We borrowed the syllabi from the madrasas in India and taught our students. Based on the syllabi, we prepared the tests,” said Ameer Yajumal, maulana of the madrasa.Abdul Rauf Khan, former education officer, said that the government’s lackadaisical approach to madrasa education has left hundreds of Muslim students in a lurch. “The government directed local units to upgrade madrasas to the secondary level without proper planning, including that for syllabi and textbooks,” said Khan. “They did not think it necessary to make provisions for madrasa students to sit for Secondary Education Examination.”Dadhiram Sharma, the education coordinator of Pratappur Rural Municipality, said his office had granted permission to local madrasas to operate as a secondary school.“We will seek admission for madrasa students in other schools and allow them to sit for the board examinations. The future of students cannot be ruined due to a lack of syllabi,” said Sharma. “We are in constant talks with the Education Coordination Unit to solve this problem once and for all.” Around 700,000 Muslim children are enrolled in 4,000 madrasas across the country. Out of the 4,000, the centre has granted government school status to about 1,000 madrasas, according to Zaheed Pervej, a Tribhuvan University professor who has researched extensively on Nepali madrasas.Sudarshan Baral, the minister for Social Development, who is also responsible for overseeing Province 5’s education sector, said that he will take immediate steps to coordinate with the Office of the Controller of Examinations in regards to the future of madrasa students. “I will talk to the concerned authority and try to give the same status and opportunity to madrasa students as that of community school students,” Baral said. On Sunday, Muslim leaders met Chief Minister Shankar Pokharel and submitted a report underlining the problems of madrasas and plausible solutions. Pokharel said that he will pressurise the concerned authority to address the issue, starting with the preparation of syllabi for madrasas that would qualify their students to sit for Secondary Education Examination. “The provincial government will take initiatives to nationalise madrasa education,” said Pokharel.","Published at : January 24, 2020",Butwal,Amrita Anmol
"Drying up of Geruwa river affects irrigation, wildlife","Around 5,000 hectares of agricultural land in Rajapur, Bardiya, is parched this winter. The Karnali River Management Project could not supply water to the area because of a sharp decline in the Geruwa river’s water flow.The project is unable to supply water in the villages of Manau, Khairichanpur, Patabhar and Pashupatinagar. The water flow in the Geruwa, an offshoot of the Karnali river a few kilometres downstream from Chisapani, has gradually declined as the Karnali changed its course because of silt formation.According to Kedar Shrestha, chief of the Karnali River Management Project, around 90 percent of the river water now flows to the western side in Kailali district and just 10 percent flows into the Geruwa river. “The silt should be removed to enhance the Geruwa river’s water flow and run the irrigation project smoothly,” said Shrestha. “We will take the necessary initiative to resolve the problem.”The Karnali river in the past decade has been gradually changing its course towards the western offshoot. Water flow in the Geruwa sharply declined in the past couple of years, as the floods deposited too much silt at Lalmatiya, blocking the river.Kamal Regi, a farmer in Geruwa Rural Municipality Ward No. 5, said farmers in Rajapur and Geruwa have been facing irrigation problems in the winter due to the sharp decline of water flow in the river. He urged the authorities concerned to clear the siltation.The Geruwa river flows through the Bardiya National Park. The wildlife in the protected area has been hugely affected because of the declining water flow in the river. According to Sandesh Paudel, a ranger at the park, animals struggle for water in the dry season. The area near the Geruwa river is the habitat of wild animals like tiger, rhino, deer and elephant, among others, conservationists say.The Department of National Park and Wildlife Conservation had allowed the park to remove the silt in the Geruwa river last year. “It was not possible for us alone to remove the huge piles of stones, pebbles and sand. We need help from a third party to resolve this problem,” said Paudel.","Published at : January 22, 2020",Bardiya,Kamal Panthi
Number of water birds increasing in Jagdishpur lake,"The population of water birds has increased in Jagdishpur, an artificial lake constructed in Kapilvastu district for the purpose of irrigation, this year.The fresh bird count concluded on Sunday showed that the lake, which was recognised as part of the Ramsar wetlands site in August 2003, is home to a total of 20,807 water birds. According to senior ornithologist Hem Sagar Baral, the number is 5,827 more than last year.Although there is an increase in numbers, there is a decrease in the variety of species of birds, say conservationists. Only 41 different bird species were found in the area this year, while 53 species were found last year.According to the conservationists, various species of sandpipers were not spotted in this year’s bird count in Jagdishpur lake. “Climate change and lack of enough food could be the main reason behind it,” said Som GC, another ornithologist.Himalayan Nature, an organisation conducting scientific research on biodiversity, in coordination with Wetland Coordination carried out the count of aquatic birds in 60 different places in the country from January 4 to 19. “A bird count was conducted in the major bird habitats. Among them, the highest number of birds are found in Jagdishpur lake,” said Baral. According to him, around 50,000 to 55,000 water birds are found in Nepal.A total of 5,150 birds of coot species have been found in the lake. According to Baral, as many as 22 birds of garganey species, a nationally threatened bird species in Nepal, were also found during the count.A team of technicians led by nature guide Dhiraj Chaudhari conducted the bird count in Jagdishpur lake. “Any area that hosts more than 3,000 birds of any particular species is termed as a ‘good habitat’. And Jagdishpur has proved to be an important habitat of water birds. It should be conserved,” said Chaudhari.Jagdishpur lake is spread over an area of 157 hectares in Kapilvastu Municipality. Every winter, birds migrate to Jagdishpur from Siberia, China, Russia, Mongolia, Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan and stay until February. Gadwall, Leaser Whistling duck, Tufted duck, Ferruginous Duck, Northern pintail, Northern shoveler, Eurasian Wigeon, Common Pochard and Cotton Pygmy-goose, et cetera are the major birds found in the lake.","Published at : January 21, 2020",Kapilvastu,Manoj Paudel
"Corruption is thriving in Province 5, watchdog officials say","On December 26, two security personnel from Bishnupura Armed Police Base Camp—chief of the camp Inspector Tej Bahadur Jora and Assistant Head Constable Birendra Prasad Chaudhary—were caught red-handed while taking a bribe of Rs6,000. It was revealed later that they had agreed to assist in the ferrying of daily essentials from Sagarahawa in Gaidahawa Rural Municipality. The Commission for the Abuse of Authority in Rupandehi is currently investigating their involvement in the case.This fiscal year, police have made red-handed arrests of six security personnel in Province 5 on various charges, including smuggling of riverbed materials and timber, and exempting tax. This calendar year, a total of 35 individuals have been implicated in 21 incidents of bribing across the province. The number is a rise from 27 arrests last year. The arrested individuals include officials at district courts, a local representative and a teacher, among others.Suresh Bhusal, information officer at the CIAA office in Butwal, said most of the complaints of abuse of authority are related to corruption in infrastructure projects and education sector in the local units.A study conducted by the CIAA this year states most of the corruption takes place during the implementation of infrastructure projects. The main challenge in controlling corruption is the political clout that protects officials of all rungs, the report states.Taranath Adhikari, chief of CIAA Butwal, said that his office has been receiving a large number of complaints regarding corruption. “It seems the people are becoming more aware,” he said. “They know that those who ask for money to get things done need to be reported to the authority. On the other hand, the rising number of irregularities in local levels shows how corruption is being institutionalised.”Mahendra Prasad Pandey, chief of the Group of Transparency Stakeholder in Butwal, said that drives to curb corruption have seen little success in the province. “There is a layer between service seekers and government officials. One needs to navigate through that layer to get things done,” Pandey said. “This is why irregularities and corruption are becoming widespread and institutionalised.”","Published at : January 19, 2020",Rupandehi,Amrita Anmol
"Province 5 trains community school teachers, students to improve SEE results","In a bid to improve students’ performance in the Secondary Education Examinations, the Province 5 government has begun training community school teachers and running special classes for students.The programme, launched by the Ministry of Social Development in the province, aims to improve students’ performance in subjects like mathematics and science. According to the ministry’s statistics, of the 75,834 students who appeared in the SEE from the province last year, 43,878 students secured D and E grades in mathematics while 25,494 students secured similar grades in science. The performance of community school students was poorer compared to their private school counterparts, with around 70 percent of the students scoring below D grade, which is poorer than the SEE results of 2016.Social Development Minister Sudarshan Baral said that the provincial government came up with the programme to improve students’ grades. He believes the programme will open opportunities for students to pursue higher studies, including technical education, engineering and medical sciences.“We have begun the reform programme because if this trend continues, we will not have enough students and the targeted students will not get an opportunity to pursue technical education,” said Baral.The reformative move comes following a study conducted by the ministry following poor SEE results last year. The study had found that students’ learning progress was decreasing due to weak teaching methods, insufficient teaching time and a lack of practical assignments for subjects like science and maths.A committee has been formed under Baral to monitor and assess the improvement of SEE results. The committee also includes the secretary at the ministry, the director of the Education and Social Development, Education Training Centre, the head of the Higher Education Division and the head of the Educational Planning and Research Division. Results Improvement Monitoring Assessment Committees have also been formed at the district level under the chiefs of the concerned District Coordination Committee.According to Tika Ram Aryal, undersecretary at the Educational Development and Research Division, the provincial government has allocated Rs 50 million for the programme, with each school receiving Rs 20,000 to Rs54,000 depending on the number of students.“This year, we will operate special classes targeting grade 10 students and introduce reformative teaching methods for teachers,” said Thaneshwor Gyawali, undersecretary at the Educational Development and Research Division. “We will gradually introduce these measures in lower classes.” This, according to Gyawali, will remove the fear and generate confidence among the students regarding subjects like mathematics and science.This year, the province will run special classes in 742 secondary schools for science and 888 secondary schools for mathematics. The ministry has selected those schools with over 20 students in grade 10 who performed poorly in last year’s SEE. A 90-minute class will be run for 52 days for each subject by the respective teachers. If there aren’t any specific subject-related teachers, the province will seek volunteers to teach the respective subjects. “All the teachers, permanent and volunteers, have been trained by experts,” said Gyawali. “The teachers have been trained to incorporate practical and experiment-based teaching methods while conducting classes.”The programme is also aimed at discouraging students from taking extra tuition and coaching classes. As per the government data, over 90 percent SEE students opt for private tuition and coaching classes to improve their grades.Under the new teaching method, the students will be taught in a practical manner as opposed to the earlier theory-oriented classes.Nepal Mathematics Association Chairman Chetraj Bhatta said that the quality of teaching and learning methods for subjects like science and maths was declining as there were no practical and experiment-based teaching methods. “Students must not only be taught to parrot the formulae so as to pass the exams,” said Bhatta. “The results will see improvements only when students are taught to solve the problems in a practical manner from the primary level.”(Madhab Aryal contributed to reporting.)","Published at : January 15, 2020",Butwal,Amrita Anmol
"Child marriage, child labour still remain major challenges in Rolpa","The local government has been facing challenges in combating minors’ issues such as child marriage, child labour and school dropouts in several federal units of Rolpa district.Since the election of the local representatives in 2017, the local level had made efforts from running awareness campaigns to introducing mid-day meals in government schools. But despite these efforts, there has not been much improvement in eradicating practices such as child marriage and child labour, and in retaining children at school.Shanta Kumar Oli, chairman of the Tribeni Rural Municipality, said the local government launched an awareness drive to end child marriage and child labour soon after the local level elections but the campaign had not been fruitful.“The rural municipality and several social organisations spend around Rs 30 million annually for child rights and children’s education. However, we haven’t been able to stop child marriage and child labour completely,” said Oli.The tradition of parents getting their children to marry at a young age is still prevalent in rural areas, says Oli. “Poor economic condition drives young children to work for the livelihood of their families. This is also why the district hasn’t been able to end child labour,” he said.According to a recent study carried out by Tribeni Rural Municipality, 227 children were involved in child labour in the local unit last fiscal year. The study shows that as many as 68 underage couples got married in 2019-20. Child marriage has been illegal in Nepal since 1963. Two years ago, the government increased the legal age for marriage from 18 to 20 years.There are 12 secondary schools, 28 basic schools and 37 child development centres in Tribeni Rural Municipality. According to data at the local level, 2,299 students have been enrolled in various schools this year. The rural municipality does not have comprehensive data on the total number of school-going children in the rural municipality.According to the rural municipality, 205 school-age children were found out of school in the current academic year. The local unit, with the help of Save the Children and Human Rights and Environmental Education Centre, initiated a campaign to bring those children to school.“We have brought almost all the children to school again. Only 12 children are deprived of education now. Efforts are on to bring them into the school system too,” said Pramila Budha, an officer at one of the social human rights organisations working in the region.Thaman and his siblings Laxmi and Tara Dangi of Garigaun could not continue their studies after their father died and their mother remarried. The Dangi siblings, who have been living with their elderly grandparents, joined a school in the municipality a few weeks ago as motivated by one of the social organisations.“I could not send them to school after the death of their father. They again started going to school with the help of the rural municipality and the social organisations,” said Dil Bahadur Dangi, the 65-year-old grandfather of the trio.The situation of the children is almost the same—if not worse—in other local units as well. All 10 local councils in the district expressed their commitment to working towards educational reforms and ensuring child rights for every child in their respective wards. The representatives of the local units gathered at the district headquarters a few days ago and signed a 15-point commitment to stopping child marriage and child labour.According to the International Labour Organisation, Nepal still has about 1.6 million children aged 5 to 17 years engaged in labour.","Published at : January 13, 2020",Rolpa,Kashiram Dangi
Bardiya District Administration Office requests locals to not enter Indian forests without due process,"The District Administration Office in Bardiya has requested locals living in the bordering parts of the district to not enter Indian forest to collect fodder and firewood without coordinating with the local authorities.The eastern part of Shantipur to western part of Rajapur (80km) in the district shares the border with India. Every day, Nepalis cross the border and bring in firewood and fodder from the Indian Bahraich district's Katarniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary and also leave their cattle to graze. Stating that locals (who have gone to the forest for fodder and firewood) have gone missing in the forest, the administration has requested the locals to coordinate with local authorities before crossing the border and entering the forest. On Tuesday, four locals of Madhuban Municipality, who went to graze their goats in the forest, had gone missing for several hours. According to police, Sumitra Singh, Khantari Basnet, Dheeraj Karna and Tej Kumari KC of Madhuban Municipality Ward No. 7 were found some six kilometres away from the border. Sumitra Singh, 42, a local of Madhuban Municipality, said she and her companions lost their way in the dense forest. “Our goats entered the forest, and we were chasing them when we lost our way,” said Singh. Locals say they are compelled to go to the Indian forest to graze their cattle and collect fodder or firewood, as there’s no forest on the Nepali side, said Singh.However, although the administration has requested locals to coordinate with local authorities before entering the Indian forest, locals are disobeying the request. They are entering the Indian forest as per their wish. “One has to follow Indian rules and regulations when in Indian territory. That’s why we request locals to coordinate with the local authorities before crossing the border. We are neighbours but we cannot violate their rules and regulations,” said Premlal Lamichhane, Chief District Officer of Bardiya, informing that it is wise to know security situation before entering forests on the other side of the border. More than three dozen villages of Badhaiyatal Rural Municipality, Gulariya, Madhuban and Rajapur Municipalities rely on the Indian forest for firewood and fodder. For the resources, locals have to pay in cash and kind. According to Basnet, the villagers voluntarily provide paddy, vegetables or cash in exchange for the services they get from the Indian authorities. She said, “We have to provide 20kg paddy to the Indian authority annually for using fodder and firewood from their forest. Sometimes we also work in the forest in exchange for firewood.” Narayan Malla, the ward chairman of Madhuban Ward No. 3, said, “Sometimes disputes occur between locals and Indian security personnel. We have received a number of complaints regarding misbehaviour towards the locals from Indian security personnel. That’s why we have requested the locals to inform the ward office before entering Indian soil.”","Published at : January 11, 2020",Bardiya,Thakur Singh Tharu
Irrigation project faces quandary in Kailali as arable land shrinks,"The eight bigha land that Laxmi Chaudhary’s great grandfather owned at Bangaun, in Tikapur Municipality, is divided among his seven progenies. What was once a vast arable land producing yield to last his family for over a year is now ready to be sold in parcels to construct houses, said Chaudhary. And it’s not just Chaudhary who is looking to turn his fields into concrete spaces. “Many others are selling their land too, for construction, because the market is close by and the price is good,” Chaudhary said. In just a span of two years, Chaudhary says the number of houses in his neighbourhood has risen from 30 to 70.These changes have rendered an irrigation project, the Rani Jamara Kulariya Irrigation Project, futile. In early 2018, the project’s second phase of construction started, expecting to water 14,300 hectares of fields upon completion. But, a year later, much of that arable land has been turned into settlement areas, and nobody now knows whether the project will now actually benefit local farmers. “Since the project hasn’t updated its survey, we can’t exactly say how much of the land the project will irrigate,” said Lalbeer Chaudhary, chief of the Rani Jamara Kulariya Irrigation Project Consumers’ Committee. “But it’s certain that much of the arable land is either being turned into settlements or are in the process.” Min Bahadur Shahi, a lecturer of Sociology at Tikapur Multiple Campus, said that the arable land is being converted into concrete because of a lack of land utilisation policy. “We’ve heard the policy is being formulated in Kathmandu, but we don’t know when it will take shape and when it will come here,” he said. “We hope the policy will also include provisions to save arable land. Neither the local unit nor the project or consumers’ committees are concerned to preserve arable land here.”With federalism in place, a majority of local units have focussed on increasing motorable roads—often at the cost of landslide- and erosion-risk. “In Kailali, the focus is seemingly in constructing more concrete structures at the cost of arable lands,” Shahi added.Moreover, officials say the arable lands are being increasingly cultivated with Lyptus trees. “The lyptus trees harm the crops, so even as the irrigation plan is afoot, it wouldn’t be all that beneficial,” said Damodar Khadka, deputy chair of the consumers’ committee. Khadka estimates about 50 bigha area of the project would benefit if it is covered with Lyptus trees. Upon its conception, the project is expected to benefit about 6,000 hectares of arable land.","Published at : January 9, 2020",Tikapur,Ganesh Chaudhary
Local units in Rupandehi prioritise construction of Buddha-related structures for tourism promotion,"Along with the preservation of historic sites, the local units in Rupandehi district have prioritised the construction of various structures related to Gautam Buddha for the tourism year 2020.As many as 10 out of the total of 16 local units have started installing Buddha’s statues and building parks to beautify their towns and promote tourism during Visit Nepal 2020.“Our main objective is to attract tourists by building structures related to Lord Buddha,” said Basudev Ghimire, mayor of Tilottama Municipality, which lies a few kilometres from Lumbini. The municipality has installed 22 statues of Buddha along the Butwal-Bhairahawa section of the Siddhartha Highway. Ghimire said the municipality has also prioritised the construction of the feeder roads connecting the Tilottama-Lumbini-Devdaha road. According to Ghimire, homestays are in operation in Semari while the local unit has been carrying out works to conserve Baunnakoti lake and other Buddhist Vihars and temples in the area. Similarly, Siddhartha Nagar Municipality has been constructing a Buddha Gate at Belhiya, a border point between Nepal and India. A life-size statue of Buddha is under construction in the Buspark area. Many statues of Buddha have been installed along the Belhiya-Lumbini road.“Siddhartha Nagar was just a pitstop for tourists travelling to and from Lumbini. But we are trying to change that now. We have launched a campaign to get benefits from the tourists visiting Lumbini,” said Mayor Hari Prasad Adhikari. According to him, the municipality has allocated a budget of Rs 200 million to promote tourism.Sainamaina, another municipality in Rupandehi that has several Buddha-era monuments, has started preserving several archaeologically important objects and places related to Gautam Buddha. The municipality has set up a temporary museum at Sirantol and kept historical statues, bricks, utensils, tools and ruins of houses believed to have been built during Buddha’s lifetime. Likewise, 11 ancient wells—including Badakuwa and Ranikuwa—have been preserved in various places in Sainamaina.“Construction work to set up a museum in the area has started,” said Mayor Chitra Bahadur Karki. The federal government has allocated Rs 100 million to set up the museum in the current fiscal year.","Published at : January 8, 2020",Butwal,Amrita Anmol

Province 5 pride projects left in limbo,"The Province 5 government had allocated Rs 50 million for the construction of the Rampur-Kapurkot road in 2018. The road was named Jibaraj Ashrit-Krishnasen road and was enlisted as a provincial pride project. Chief Minister Shankar Pokharel, through the project, had planned to develop the hill districts of the province into ‘hill stations’ to promote tourism.In the current fiscal year, the government has allocated Rs 200 million to construct around 300 kilometres of the road. However, the pride project has yet to start. According to the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure Development, it has been preparing to begin the construction by dividing the road into four sections—Palpa, Arghakhanchi, Pyuthan and Rolpa. “The first phase work of the project will start soon,” said Bhimarjun Pandey, the ministry spokesperson. The provincial executive had also enlisted two other development projects—Charange-Jhumsa road and Lumbini Provincial Hospital—as pride projects. However, these development projects are also left in limbo. The provincial government in the last fiscal year had allocated Rs 100 million for the construction of the Charange-Jhumsa road, which is taken as an alternative route to the landslide-prone Siddababa section of the Siddhartha Highway. But the project has not seen much progress. The province has allocated an additional Rs 100 million budget for the project in the current fiscal year as well.Binod Chaudhary, chief at the Infrastructure Development Office in Gulmi, admitted that works along the Charange-Jhumsa road are yet to begin. “The work has been delayed as the existing road alignment needs to be changed. Last year’s work is still going on and the tender bidding process is underway to spend this year’s budget,” said Chaudhary.Similarly, the government’s plan to upgrade the zonal hospital to Lumbini Provincial Hospital has also hit a snag. The authorities had attempted to remove shutters rented to the local traders for business purpose. The traders knocked on the doors of the High Court, and the judicial body issued a stay order against the government. The work has been halted as the case is still pending at the court.Besides these three pride projects, almost all other development projects in the province are at a snail’s pace. The capital expenditure in the province is low in the first quarter of the current fiscal year. Physical Infrastructure Development Minister Baijanath Chaudhary said that seven percent of the capital expenditure was spent in the first four months of the current fiscal year. The government had planned to spend around 20 percent during the period. “We had to spend a long time in the preparation phase. The development projects will gather momentum now,” minister Chaudhary said.","Published at : January 5, 2020",Rupandehi,Ghanashyam Gautam
24 ropanies of Rani Mahal’s land encroached upon: Report,"Haphazard construction of new infrastructure around Rani Ghat, or Rani Mahal as the palace is famously known as, has put the historical site at risk and destroyed the beauty of the palace.Amid news of such construction work taking place in the area, the National Vigilance Centre has released a new report stating that around 24 ropanies of the land of the palace has been encroached upon by these new hotels and restaurants.The report also states that ownership papers of the palace land and its vicinity have been erased from the record books. The Centre has concluded this act has been carried out in collusion with the employees of District Land Revenue, District Survey Office and the then VDC office. Shiva Parajuli, the amin, or land surveyor, of Tansen Municipality, said Rani Mahal covers an area of 5 ropanies 12 aanas 2 dam. But according to Lilaraj Bhattarai, a local of Baughaghumha, Ranimahal covers around 30 ropanies of land.And despite concerned authority knowing about the haphazard construction, it has remained a mute spectator, locals say. “Ranimahal has already lost most of its land area,” said Tara Singh Thapa, a local of Tansen.Rani Mahal is a castle built by former Palpa governor Khadga Shumsher Rana more than a century ago on the banks of the Kali Gandaki river. A year ago, the Department of Archeology had handed over the responsibility of the palace to Tansen Municipality.The land of Rani Mahal has over the years been registered in the name of individuals after important documents of the palace were destroyed in a blaze 14 years. And even though the registered landowners have been frequenting the ward office to pay revenue for their land plots (as per the registration), the ward office says it has not received the revenue yet. Krishna Prasad Basyal, chairman of Bagnaskali Rural Municipality (a bordering local unit to Tansen Municipality), said they will solve the problem through discussion with the Department of Archeology and municipal representatives.Bhattarai, however, says that the land registered in the name of the individuals should be transferred back to the palace. He said, “The palace should be given back its encroached land. There were parks and gardens on the premises of the palace. Now, it has nothing.”Jog Bahadur Pandeya, a local, said that the garden of the palace was registered in the name of individuals more than 40 years ago. “Then, no one paid attention to conserve the palace. But now that the palace has become a source of tourist attraction, people want to know the details of land ownership,” said Pandeya. The last major renovation of Rani Mahal was undertaken in the late 1990s.","Published at : January 5, 2020",Palpa,Madhab Aryal
Contractors selling subsidised rice in Rukum (East) due to lack of employees in depots,"Every year, the government-run Food Management and Trade Company allocates certain quotas of subsidised rice for Rukumkot and Takasera in Rukum (East).Contractors are selected to transport this subsidised rice to remote villages. But due to the lack of employees in the depots of the Food Management and Trade Company, contractors themselves are selling the rice in the villages—and this has become a problem for the villagers.This year, the Food Management and Trade Company Ltd has allocated 500 quintals of rice for Takasera and 700 quintals of rice for Rukumkot in the first phase of the fiscal year.“The problem is that contractors stay in the villages only for a few days,” said Daribhan Budha, a local of Sisne Rural Municipality Ward No. 4. It becomes a problem for the local people because they are forced to buy the rice whenever the contractors are in their villages, irrespective of whether they can afford it or not.At the depots, Mota rice comes at Rs 3,800 per quintal and Sona Mansuli at Rs 4,600 per quintal in Rukumkot. The same quantity of rice costs around Rs 4,200 (Mota rice) and Rs 5,200 (Sona Mansuli) in the bazaar areas—the cost difference is huge for the people in these villages. In Takasera, the company sells Sona Mansuli at Rs 4,700 per quintal whereas the same quantity of rice costs around Rs 5,500 per quintal in local shops. Villagers in these remote parts of Rukumkot and Taksera say that the problem has arisen due to the ignorance of the Food Management and Trade Company. For example, there’s a depot of the company in Shobha village in Rukumkot, but it hasn’t had an employee for the last 19 years.Rapti Bahusewa Pvt Ltd is the contractor responsible to transport rice in Rukumkot, whereas MB builders is responsible to transport rice in Takasera. Rice needs to be transported from Bhairahawa to Takasera and Tulasipur (Dang) to Rukumkot. In the last fiscal year, the company has sold only 200 quintals (out of 1,500 quintals of allocated quota) in Rukumkot and 500 quintals (out of 1,000 quintals of allocated quota) in Takasera.Rukumkot and Takasera fall under Rukum (East) territory, but currently the branch of Food Management and Trade Company Ltd in Rukum (West) looks after the management and transportation of subsidised rice in Rukumkot and Takasera.Chandra Bahadur Khadka, chief at the branch office, admitted that they have been facing problems to transport rice in the depots due to lack of employees and infrastructures. He said, “Although contractors are selling rice in the remote areas themselves, they cannot deceive locals while selling rice. We have instructed them to sell rice at a fixed amount.”According to him, the subsidised rice is being transported in the presence of the District Administration Office, the District Police Office, and the Ward Office along with people’s representatives.Locals are also demanding a branch office of the Food Management and Trade Company Ltd be opened in Rukumkot, along with depots in Takasera and Ranmamaikot. “In the last fiscal year, the District Food Committee had requested the company to establish a branch office in Rukumkot and depots in Takasera and Ranmamaikot, but to no avail,” said Khadka.","Published at : January 3, 2020",Rukum (east),Hari Gautam
Child marriage continues unabated in Dang,"A year ago, two teenage couples from Tulsipur Secondary School in Shantinagar Rural Municipality got married—despite the school administration’s repeated attempts to stop them.Gobinda Bahadur Gharti, principal of the secondary school, said that he personally tried various methods to keep the children from getting married. “I even went up to their home and tried to convince the parents, but my efforts were in vain,” Gharti told the Post. “They got married anyway. One couple has given birth to a baby already as well, and the new mother has dropped out of school.”In another incident, a few months ago, a female student from the same school eloped with a man from Kohalpur. Gharti said he immediately informed the police but they took no action. “Nobody is dedicated enough to stop the practice of child marriage,” Gharti said. “The parents too do little. Children who are about to get married or have already gotten married need psychological counselling, but no one has paid any attention to such measures.”The practice of child marriage is widespread in Dang. Chief of the rural municipality, Kaman Singh Dangi, said 33 percent of total marriages in his rural municipality are child marriages. “We are launching various campaigns considering the practice as a major challenge of the local unit,” Dangi said.In Shantinagar Rural Municipality, over 20 percent of couples that are married as children give birth before 20 years of age, according to Hari Pun, who is the health department chief at the rural municipality. “There are incidents where women as young as 14 have given birth,” KC said. “As a result, many of them suffer from uterus-related diseases.” Khim Bahadur Basnet, chair of the Childrens’ Network in Shantinagar-3, said in a short span of time, he has noted four child marriages in the area. He tried to keep them from happening but couldn’t, he said. “I called a number of students and rallied up to the house where the marriages were taking place, but nobody was there to support us,” he said. “We called the ward chair, but he didn’t come. The police didn’t come either. We haven’t gotten the support from the authorities, leaders and police.”Pima Dangi, a ninth grader from Madhapur Secondary School, said that many of her friends get married early because of poverty and family pressure. “Even those who are well-educated about the harms of child marriage and associated with childrens’ clubs are also getting married,” she said.Child marriage is continuing unabated in the district because the parents are not keeping track of what their children are up to, according to Neelam KC, a member of the women-centric Nigarani Mahila Samuha. “Some parents are negligent, while others are plain illiterate and aloof about the consequences of child marriage,” KC said.Increasing incidents of child marriage has resulted in an increasing number of divorce cases, according to Mithila Shah, the coordinator of the judicial committee of the rural municipality. “We frequently receive cases where the couple wants to divorce after a year or two in the marriage,” she said. “We counsel them and try to reconcile them.”Assistant Sub-inspector Bharat Nath Yogi, chief of the Chiraghat police station, said that the police haven’t been able to control child marriage despite many efforts because the parents themselves don’t put in any effort. “The parents are more concerned about marrying their children than giving them a good education,” he said. “It’s difficult to pursue legal procedure when that becomes the case.”","Published at : January 2, 2020",Dang,Durgalal KC
Children in juvenile reform centre deprived of schooling,"A 15-year-old boy, hailing from Kathmandu, is one among the 126 children at the juvenile reform home in Banke. He and two of his fellow inmates sat for the half-yearly examination of grade nine just a few weeks ago. The ninth graders say they took the exams without having gone through textbooks or regular classes.“The English teacher provided a book to us only in the second class,” said the 15-year-old, adding that the teacher then taught them occasionally. The children at the home were deprived of books, stationery and regular classes. Jayendu Juvenile Reform Home was established in Duduwa Rural Municipality-6 a year and a half ago with the objective to reform juvenile offenders mainly through education. However, the children—most of whom have been convicted of rape, illegal weapons possession, drug- and human-trafficking—have been deprived of basic rights like education and health.A few months ago, following repeated complaints by the children at the reform home and human rights activists, the local administration had arranged a four-room building to run the school. A teacher had also been employed; however, the school did not provide textbooks or stationery to the children.A child, who was studying in grade six in his home district of Rukum, was brought to the reform home around two months ago. He wanted to join the classes rather than stay idle the whole day. He, however, complained that the teacher taught him nothing that was worth learning.“Learning and teaching are not run in accordance with the curriculum. All that our teacher rtaught us was how to write our names. Students from grades 5 to 8 were kept in the same room, and there was only one teacher who taught us all the subjects,” he complained.Various individuals and organisations working for human rights for juvenile prisoners have been repeatedly raising questions regarding the rights of the children staying there.Bhola Mahat, the province 5 coordinator of the centre, said that the organisation had submitted a memorandum to the District Administration Office in Banke after the children in the home were found in poor condition. “The children here [at the juvenile reform home] are deprived of basic rights, like health and education. Reform home is not a prison. The fundamental rights of these children should be protected at any cost,” he demanded.The local administration has made assurances that it will reform the home and run effective classes for the children staying there. “We have requested the Education Development and Coordination Unit to manage the teachers’ posts and provide textbooks as well as other required stationery. The classes will be run effectively soon,” said Chief District Officer Kumar Bahadur Khadka. Besides issues of lack of education, juvenile reform homes are also overcrowded—take for example the juvenile reform home situated in Aasmanpur, which has the capacity to accommodate 75 children but is currently accommodating 126 children.Bimala Kauji, the chief at the reform home, admitted that the children were deprived of a good education and are living in terrible conditions. “We have to arrange beds for the children on the floor, as beds available here are not enough for them. It is quite challenging to manage the children since the reform home has far more children beyond its capacity,” said Kauji.","Published at : January 1, 2020",Banke,Madhu Shahi
A model public school in Dang provides mandatory yoga lessons,"Each classroom at the Kauwaghari Basic School in Dangisharan Rural Municipality-2 is carpeted and has water filters, with the students busy studying. The school has ‘yoga classes’ for its seventh period where the students are led through basic yoga exercises. For these reasons, Kauwaghari has emerged as a model public school in an area where poor infrastructure and irregularities are the dominating features associated with public schools. Unlike many public schools around the region that charge fees under various obscure headings, Kauwaghari doesn’t demand any such fees.“The region has a history where many guardians do not send their children to school because they are poor,” said Lakshman Devkota, the school principal. “In view of which, we have exempted the guardians of any fees, and created a proper environment for education and fun.”The walls of each class feature the rosters listing the students’ names, including their guardians’ contact number and address. Whenever a student is absent, the guardian is duly called and asked about his/her whereabouts. “At the end of the year, we evaluate the performances of the students and also the teachers,” Devkota said. “Every teacher is given a target they need to meet and improve the following year.”Yoga has been made a regular class, a part of the curriculum for students in grades three, four and five. “Yoga not just provides physical exercise but also makes the students attentive in classes and help develop positive thinking,” said Robarsingh Dhakal, the yoga teacher.The students the Post talked to said they are excited by practical lessons such as yoga and computer science. “I like that nobody is beaten for not doing homework, but everybody follows the school rules,” said Bharat Pariyar, a fifth-grader. “We follow discipline and rules.” Yashoda Basnet, Pariyar’s classmate, said there is good coordination between students and teachers. She said that all of her classmates take turns to clean the classroom and the playground.Kauwaghari Basic School has 108 students and seven teachers in total. Principal Devkota said that the village is predominantly a Dalit settlement where the parents can’t afford to send their children to private boarding schools. Devkota noted that the school is assisted by an organisation called Society for Environment and Education Development (SEED).Pima Kumari Khadka, deputy chair of the rural municipality, said that the basic school is a model school in the local unit. “The school has even invited representatives from other schools so that they could emulate it,” she said. “The school has not just provided a good education in a healthy environment for free but has also set an example for other schools to follow.”","Published at : December 29, 2019",Dang,Durgalal KC
Millions of foreign currencies rotting away in Lumbini,"Around 1.5 million tourists, both domestic and international, visit Lumbini every year. Most of them, especially Buddhist visitors, offer currencies to the various statues and monuments, especially the Mayadevi Temple and Ashok Pillar. Millions of foreign currencies get collected in the birthplace of Buddha every year. The Lumbini Development Trust makes use of Nepali currencies, but the foreign currencies have been in store for years. For lack of proper upkeep— the currencies are stored in wet stores—the money has even started to decay.The government has done nothing to manage the collected amount. Trust officials say many currencies are from countries whose money Nepal’s central bank does not exchange. Even though the Trust has set up contribution boxes in various places, many pilgrims offer the money to the statues themselves. Currently, a total of Rs190 million is in store.The Trust had corresponded with Nepal Rastra Bank six years ago to discuss how to utilise the stored money. “Lack of management of foreign currencies has been a trouble for us,” said Saroj Bhattarai, a member secretary of the Trust. “Foreign coins get washed, but paper currencies lie neglected.” Bhattarai said that the central bank has paid no heed to address this issue despite repeated correspondence.Bhattarai further said that the process of exchanging the collected foreign currencies is complicated; hence the Trust is storing it for the time being. “The paper currencies are rotting away. There have been talks about auctioning the currencies for sale,” he said. “Some of the notes measure up to one lakh rupees.”Surendra Muni Shakya, chief of funds at the Trust, said that the currencies have been collected since 2042 BS. “To keep the currencies from rotting further, they have been enveloped in polythene and clothes,” Shakya said. “I have informed the central bank about this.” Shakya told the Post that the central bank has said it would take the money for exchange in Singapore, and in case the currencies couldn’t be exchanged there, they wouldn’t be returned. “This has pushed us further into a crisis,” Shakya said.The Trust keeps a record of the total amount collected out of offerings presented by the pilgrims. Of the total 190million rupees, 91.6 million is from Myanmar, 67.4 from Vietnam, and 25million from Indonesia. There are currencies from Sri Lanka, Mongolia, Bangladesh, Laos, Oman, Uganda, Bhutan, Congo and Afghanistan, among others. These are paper currencies. There’s no record of the total amount of coins because the central bank has declined to accept those, according to Shakya.Officials at the Trust said that it corresponded with the Siddharthanagar branch of Nepal Rastra Bank five years ago with all the documents, but Rajendra Bhattarai, director of the branch, said that the bank hasn’t received the statement that it wanted.“For this kind of transaction, we have to coordinate with the Bank of Singapore’s foreign currency exchange department,” said Bhattarai. “If the currencies do not qualify for exchange, then they may be seized. So the Trust should come up with a decision on what to do if that happens.”One official at the Trust said that the government can go through diplomatic channels to exchange currencies. “The government is more concerned about appointing a party faithful in the Trust rather than managing the currency,” the official said, requesting anonymity.Likewise, Om Prasad Aryal, former chief of funds at the Trust, said that the lack of management of currencies received as offerings is entirely the government’s shortcomings. “I tried to get the government’s attention to the issue, but all efforts went in vain,” he said.","Published at : December 28, 2019",Bhairahawa,Madhav Dhungana
Tansen’s ‘pride projects’ in limbo,"Soon after the local level elections in 2017, the people’s representatives of Tansen Municipality in Palpa district selected 15 development projects as ‘pride projects’. Among them, the municipality prioritised five projects—all the pride projects are left in limbo.While a few projects started so far are moving at a snail’s pace, the majority of the pride projects are yet to be initiated.The municipality had invited a tender to pave granites along around 800 metres from Bhagawati Temple to Silkhantol through Shitalpati two years ago. CM Shivalaya JV was awarded a contract valued at Rs 18.3 million. “The contractor has already received Rs10 million, but it has completed only around 12 percent of the work,” said Bishnu Paudel, the planning officer at the municipality. The contractor is now out of contact, leaving the project incomplete. “We wrote to the contractor many times. He assured to resume work soon but to no avail,” said Paudel.Tansen Municipality has set aside Rs420 million for the pride projects. The municipality allocated Rs98 million to the projects in the current fiscal year. However, the progress both on financial and physical fronts of such projects is negligible. Mayor Ashok Kumar Shahi admitted the delay but assured that works on the pride projects would be completed as soon as possible. The municipality also includes the waste management of Tansen, the district headquarters of Palpa, in the list of the pride project. The local unit planned to construct a landfill site at Shivapokhari to manage the garbage. But the project is left in limbo due to protests from the local people.Similarly, the municipality’s plan of constructing a bus park in Bandevi and installing a Buddha statue named Big Buddha in Shreenagar has yet to kick off. According to Mayor Shahi, a master plan of Big Buddha is in the final stage. “We will soon invite tender and initiate the work,” he added.","Published at : December 27, 2019",Palpa,Madhab Aryal
Fight between two Banke-based journalists reaches police station,"A heated altercation between two local journalists in Banke has become a police case after one of them allegedly set two thugs on the other on Sunday.Sangin Sharma, the executive editor of kanchulikhabar.com, was reportedly assaulted by two men following a row over a payment issue with a fellow journalist Pujan Bishwakarma, the executive editor of Yugyan daily.Sharma has claimed that two local goons—Dipendra Kunwar and Ramesh Mijar—assaulted him at Bishwakarma’s order. Bishwakarma is also the Province 5 committee member of Nepal Communist Party. Sharma has suffered injuries in his face, head and eyes.Following the incident, both Sharma and Bishwakarma had reached the Kohalpur Area Police Office to register complaints against each other.Deputy Superintendent of Police Hem Bahadur Shahi said the alleged assaulters, Kunwar and Mijar, were on the run. Bishwakarma said that the fight broke out after Sharma hurled casteist epithets at him.On Sunday, Sharma had allegedly told Bishwakarma that the latter could not be respected as a journalist because he was from a lower caste.Bishwakarma has accused Sharma of repeatedly calling him names and using racial slurs in the past as well, allegations that Sharma denied.Police have filed a case against Sharma, charging him with caste-based discrimination. Sharma said police refused to register his complaint against Bishwakarma. Meanwhile, Banke district chapter of the Federation of Nepali Journalists has formed a committee to investigate into the incident. Thakur Singh Tharu, district chair of the federation, said that the committee would release its investigation report in a few days and take a decision accordingly.","Published at : December 25, 2019",Banke,Madhu Shahi
Police maintain tight surveillance over Chand outfit in Rolpa and Dang,"After arresting around three dozen leaders and cadres of the Chand outfit in Rolpa, the district security committee said on Tuesday they are searching for Netra Bikram Chand, the general secretary of the Chand’s faction of the Nepal Communist Party.Chand, a firebrand Maoist leader during the conflict, had left the Maoist party led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal in 2012, along with two other senior leaders—Mohan Baidya and Ram Bahadur Thapa. The three leaders had accused Dahal of leaving the “people’s war” halfway when they joined the peace process in 2006.Read: Security agencies intensify manhunt for Netra Bikram ChandIn 2014, following disagreements over launching a new revolution, Chand left Baidya and Thapa to form his own party—the Communist Party of Nepal. But Thapa, two years later, returned to Dahal’s fold and is now the home minister, pitting him against Chand and his outfit.The leaders of the Chand outfit went underground after the government branded Chand party as a criminal outfit and banned its activities in March.""The violent activities of the party have decreased considerably after the arrest of its influential leaders, but the cadres continue to collect money from the local units,"" concluded the security committee.The district authorities have been investigating if the local units and administrators financially supported the party.Chand cadres were involved in burning down government vehicles, destroying telephone towers and other physical infrastructure on numerous occasions. But after the government ban, more than 1,000 Chand cadres have been arrested across the country. ""Around three dozen of them have been arrested from Rolpa alone,"" Police said.Police have already arrested former district in-charge of Ropla, Dal Bahadur Khatri, Jaya Prakash Roka and Santosh Subedi from different parts of the district. They have been kept at prisons in Dang and Rolpa.Roka, who was arrested four months ago from the eastern part of Rolpa, has been kept in judicial custody in Rolpa prison.Read: Another Chand cadre’s killing raises questions about government’s stance—and style—against the outfitSince the arrests, the morale of police has gone high, according to the Deputy Superintendent of Police Chitra Bahadur Gurung, the chief of Rolpa police.""There is a legal provision to arrest anyone involved in violence,"" the DSP said. ""We have received feedback that peace and security have been restored in the inner parts of the villages as well.""""The leaders of Chand outfit have been arrested to maintain peace and security in the district,"" said Laxman Dhakal, Chief District Officer of Rolpa.Police have also arrested Chuda Mani Oli, the central committee member of Chand's outfit for the second time.Read: Human rights body summons police involved in the killing of Chand cadreA few months ago, police arrested Chandra Bahadur Chand, the brother of Netra Bikram and one of the central leaders of the outfit. He has been kept in judicial custody in Dang.As police have tightened the screw over the Chand outfit, the 21 high-profile leaders of the party arrested in October in Dang decided to remain in prison when they could have gone out by paying the bail amount of Rs15,000 each.Justice Ritendra Thapa on Monday gave the verdict to release the prisoners on bail, but none of them paid the bail money. “Because they did not pay the bail amount, they are in prison,” superintendent of police Janak Bhattarai, the chief of Dang Police, said. “They will be released once they pay the amount.""The 21 leaders were arrested on the night of October 17 from a house at Magaraina in Rajpur Rural Municipality Ward No. 4, where they had come for a meeting. Police had found guns and explosive devices in the house.","Published at : December 25, 2019",Rolpa/dang,Kashiram Dangi						 &
Two local units in Rolpa make policies for red panda conservation,"Sunchhahari and Thabang Rural Municipalities, two local units in Rolpa district, have formulated new policies and programmes to conserve the endangered red panda. As red pandas are commonly seen in these areas, people’s representatives have formulated the plans to save the endangered species.Along with the red panda conservation policies, the local units have started campaigns at the local level to preserve biodiversity and wild animals in all of the wards. Aash Bahadur Pun Magar, chairman of Sunchhahari Rural Municipality, said, “We plan to conserve biodiversity in all wards and have allocated necessary budget for the conservation programmes.” According to Bagabir Gharti, a local of Sunachhahari village, two red pandas were found in the village three years ago. He said, “Locals had rescued them and the then-District Forest Office had handed over the red pandas to the Central Zoo in Kathmandu.” According to the villagers, red panda’s habitat, faeces and playground are found in the forest areas in these local units; however, authorities have not conducted a census survey to determine its population.To make sure their conservation efforts are foolproof, Dadhiram Kandel, division forest officer in Rolpa, said they have started to train local residents to conserve biodiversity. “It’s important to protect the habitat of the red panda. We have started programmes to plant bamboos, construct ponds and maintain ecology,” said Kandel.The Red Panda Network has also been running community-based red panda conservation programme in Sunchhahari and Thabang villages. Teman Gharti, ward chairman of Sunchhahari Ward No. 3, said, “We have started campaigns in the local level to aware people. Locals are also motivated to conserve endangered species.”Red panda, known as Habre in Nepali, is one of the rare animal species inhabiting the temperate forests with an abundance of bamboo in Nepal, India, Bhutan, northern Myanmar and southwestern China. The estimated number of red pandas is less than 10,000 in the world, with around 1,000 of them in Nepal.According to conservationists, unsustainable construction of roads that pass through red panda habitats, deforestation, forest fires, poaching, attack from predators, along with the loss of food sources are major challenges facing red panda conservation.","Published at : December 25, 2019",Rolpa,Kashiram Dangi
Wild boars and monkeys become a menace in Pyuthan,"The population of wild animals—particularly wild boars and Rhesus monkeys—has gradually increased in Bijulikot Community Forest, and has become a source of menace for the residents of Bijuli, Raspurkot, Pakala, Baraula and Dangbang areas in the eastern part of Pyuthan for the last four years.The animals have been destroying fields, causing financial loss to locals. Yet, concerned stakeholders have remained silent spectators, locals say. Yanka Bahadur Rayamajhi, a local of Madai, said that they have been adopting various measures to keep the wild boars and monkeys from their fields, but to no avail. “Wild boars and monkeys have destroyed our ready-to-harvest corn, whereas hares and ghorals have been destroying our wheat and peas crops,” said Rayamajhi, adding that they have started to leave their land barren due to the wild animals.Most of the farmers have constructed fence-like structures to stop wild animals from entering their farmlands. “Even this method has not worked here. We don’t know what to do now,” Rayamajhi said.A majority of farmers in Baireni, Madai, Chitipani, Chiurapani and Hattipaila of Bijuli have been affected due to the menace of wild boars. Parbata Rayamajhi, a Chiurapani local, said there were few wild boars in the forest some four years ago. She said, “Now, there are herds of wild boars in the forest. We have been facing difficulties to collect fodder and firewood from the forests due to wild boars.” Farmers, who used to grow vegetables in commercial quantity in the past, said they have no other option than to leave their farmlands barren. Kamala KC, a local of Bijuli, said that they have frequented the rural municipal office regarding their problems. “But none of the officials paid heed to our day to day problem,” said KC, adding that they have no other option than to shift their settlement.Nabil Bikram Shah, chairman of Airawati Rural Municipality, said that the rural municipal office has been receiving complaints of farmers on a daily basis. He said, “Wild boars and monkeys have been troubling the villagers for a long time. But we cannot do anything to control them due to lack of human resources.”According to him, the rural municipal office has also notified the Division Forest Office about the problem. Hari Paudel, a ranger of the Division Forest Office, wild animals cannot be killed or captured. “But we have a provision to compensate farmers if their crops or vegetables are damaged by wild animals. We will inspect the areas and evaluate the destructions made by the animals to compensate farmers.” Shah said most of the settlements lie between forest areas. “This is the main reason why wild animals enter farmlands frequently,” said Shah.","Published at : December 24, 2019",Pyuthan,Giru Prasad Bhandari
Pappu gets permission to repair damaged Jabdighat bridge,"The government authority has allowed Pappu Construction, notorious for grabbing a large number of projects but not completing them on time, to repair the collapsed bridge over the Babai river at Jabdighat, Bardiya.Ram Kumar Dev, chief at the Division Road Office in Nepalgunj, confirmed granting permission to the contractor for the repair work. “The contractor (Pappu Construction) wrote us twice, asking for permission to repair the damaged bridge and embankment,” he said. The bridge had caved in due to floods triggered by incessant rainfall in August 2017 before it was handed over to the government authorities. Two spans had caved in as the floods damaged two pillars of the 435-metre long bridge. The public claimed the bridge had suffered damage as the contractor had used substandard materials while building the bridge.The contractor proposed to repair the bridge at its own cost. “We are planning to repair the bridge considering the hardship faced by the local people. As the division road office has given us go-ahead, we will complete it by mid-May 2020,” said Hari Narayan Rauniyar, former proprietor of the Pappu Construction.The Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority had filed a corruption case at the Special Court against Rauniyar, his son Sumit Rauniyar and 11 others for building a substandard bridge over the Babai river in Jabdighat. The case is pending at the court. The Puppu Construction had constructed the bridge along the Gulariya-Rammapur road linking northern Bardiya with the East-West Highway at an estimated cost of Rs 166.8 million. The bridge collapse has disrupted transportation in the area, causing inconvenience to thousands of people.","Published at : December 23, 2019",Bardiya,Kamal Panthi
Solar and wind energy project lights up four villages in Palpa,"A new solar and wind energy project has illuminated a total of 143 households, seven government offices and several schools in four villages in Nisdi Rural Municipality in Palpa.The four villages—Kaafal, Rukse Bhanjyang, Maulathar and Jhyaltung—never had access to the central transmission line, compelling locals to depend on lanterns and candles for light till date. But with this new energy project, which produces 25 kilowatts of electricity—15kw from wind energy and 10kw from solar energy—residents of the villages now have access to electricity.The project, Mityal Solar and Wind Energy, was slated to be completed a year and a half ago, but its deadline was pushed back owing to the construction company’s negligence, locals say. The project’s original deadline was mid-July.But Bhupindra Sunari, chairperson of the alternative energy consumers’ committee, said that despite the missing of the deadline, locals are happy about the project’s completion. “Many people had ridiculed the project, doubting if it’d ever culminate,” said Sunari. “But it’s a relief that the project is finally complete.”A representative from the construction company said that the project was pushed back because they had to import machines from overseas.The project was constructed jointly by the Alternative Energy Promotion Centre and Nisdi Rural Municipality, with a total budget of Rs21.5 million, according to Sunari. The locals too contributed land worth about Rs600000 for the project, while also providing widespread labour help.According to Yogendra Baral, of the Krishna Grill and Engineering Works that undertook the project, currently the electricity is distributed between 4am to 10pm every day. Once a minor complication with transformer is remedied, electricity will be supplied 24 hours, said Jabarsingh Saru, deputy chair of the electricity distribution committee. “The locals are delighted,” he said. “So are the workers at various offices.”However, the price the locals have to pay for the power may change. Currently, the locals are paying Rs150 for consuming up to five units, with an additional Rs50 for repair and maintenance. But once consumption crosses five units, the fare will be Rs15 for each additional unit. It has also been agreed among the construction company and the community that the machines at the site will be repaired by the construction company for the first year and the community will take over maintenance works after that. Two years ago, a small-scale project of 1200w was tested for feasibility.“Now we don’t have to wait for access to the central transmission line,” said Dhan Bahadur Thada, a teacher of Gaurishankar Secondary School. “We are all happy.”","Published at : December 22, 2019",Palpa,Madhab Aryal
Butwal sub-metropolis declared ‘street people-free zone’,"Following a year-long campaign to rescue beggars living on the streets, Butwal Sub-metropolis was declared a ‘street beggar-free zone’ on Saturday amid a function presided by the provincial Minister of Law and Internal Affairs Kul Prasad KC.The sub-metropolis’s campaign is supported by the provincial government and Manav Sewa Ashram, a humanitarian organisation.The year-long campaign rescued 197 beggars stranded on the streets. Of them, 72 have been rehabilitated in a shelter home, according to city officials.“Food, shelter and clothes are a man’s fundamental rights,” said Mayor Shivaraj Subedi. “From hereon, nobody will have to spend the night on the streets in Butwal.”Meanwhile, Minister KC said that the sub-metropolis will not allow anyone to beg on the streets. The sub-metropolis, provincial Ministry of Social Development, District Administration Office, District Police and Manav Sewa Ashram will jointly take the responsibility to monitor the rule.The city officials had been monitoring the city during the night for a month before making the declaration. In the past week alone, 40 street people were rescued. All the rescued persons have been housed in the shelter at the Ashram, which exclusively works to rescue street people.The Ashram currently provides shelter to 125 people, including four children and 25 elderly. The Ashram provides food and medicine for the needy. It also provides yoga and exercise sessions.“After three months of rehabilitation, we send those with families to their homes in coordination with the local unit and the police,” said Saru Adhikari, co-coordinator of the Ashram. “If they don’t have a family, we house them here for the time being.”Provincial Minister of Social Development Sudarshan Baral said that a campaign to re-establish street people will be launched across the province in the coming years, aiming to make the whole province street beggar-free.“Declaring the city street people free is not a great thing,” said KC, the minister of law. “It’s far more important to create a situation where nobody would have to come to the street.”Prior to this, on October, another sub-metropolis Bharatpur was declared street beggar-free zone.","Published at : December 22, 2019",Butwal,Amrita Anmol
Province 5 government fails to conserve Buddha-era lake,"A week ago, Priyanka Kurnagal of Sri Lanka visited Sagarhawa Lake, a historic site in Jagadishpur of Kapilvastu district. Kurnagal was excited to visit the place, which is a major attraction for Buddhists from around the world. However, upon arrival, she was taken by surprise to see that the sacred site turned into a fishery, with locals setting fishing traps all over the lake.Another visitor from Cambodia, Lensen Howe, was also disheartened by the scenes he encountered at the lake, where people were netting and killing fishes. Many Buddhist worshippers have expressed similar sentiments after visiting the Buddha-era lake that is spread over an area of about 100 bighas. The then Niglihawa VDC had leased the lake to Bijay Khanal, a local, on a contract basis for five years to operate a fishery.Despite repeated complaints from locals demanding an end to fishing in the lake, the concerned authorities tasked with the preservation of the lake have turned a blind eye to the water body’s degradation. However, with the provincial government directing the Lumbini Development Trust with the task of conserving and promoting the lake area, the 2,600-year-old lake that holds historical and archaeological importance is heading to become a no-fishing area.The Sagarhawa Lake area has been one of the pilgrimage sites for Buddhist devotees for a long time. According to archaeologist Basant Bidari, the lake has been mentioned in Chinese and Buddhist scriptures where they talk of the slaughter of 9,999 Shakyas. It is believed that the slaughter site is the present Sagarhawa, and because of the unpleasant incident that occurred in the past, Buddhist pilgrims visit the lake to pray for the loved ones whom they lost untimely.Himal Upreti, an archaeological officer at the Trust, said that fishing activities at the holy site have defiled the historic lake.“These sort of activities affect the archaeological aspect of the site,” said Upreti. “Items of historical significance can sustain damage and also be lost in the water because of unnecessary human activities.”Earlier in 2015/16, locals had filed a complaint at the District Administration Office against the handing over of the contract to Khanal. However, the authorities failed to take any action. The Lumbini Development Trust, which was tasked with the conservation of the Sagarhawa Lake, also failed to deploy officials to curb the illegal activities, stating that the Trust was not given the jurisdiction to carry out conservation works at the lake area.The Trust was formed in 1985 as provisioned by the Lumbini Development Trust Act 1985 to implement Lumbini Master Plan and explore, excavate and conserve archaeological sites scattered in Kapilavastu, Rupandehi and Nawalparasi districts.Last week, on December 15, a decision by the Province 5 Ministry of Industry, Tourism, Forest and Environment entrusted the Trust with the conservation and promotion of the lake.“Earlier, the lake area was not under our jurisdiction,” said Saroj Bhattarai, acting member secretary of the Trust. “We had stopped fishing activities in the lake last year, but we failed to follow up on the matter after that. Now, we have the authority to permanently put a stop to all fishing activities at the lake.”Bhattarai said the Trust is currently preparing a plan to preserve the lake site.“We will fix the signboards and boundary wires, and initiate a drive to clean and clear the shrub-covered areas,” he said.","Published at : December 21, 2019",Kapilvastu,Manoj Paudel
Local units in Rukum East and West come together to preserve biodiversity,"Sisne, Puthauttarganga and Banfikot local units in Rukum East and West have taken initiatives to conserve a biodiversity hotspot known for being home to rare species like red pandas and pangolins.Officials of Sisne and Puthauttarganga Rural Municipalities of Rukum (East) and Banfikot Rural Municipality in Rukum (West) have requested the provincial and federal governments to help them in conservation efforts. These local units share borders with each other and are rich in biodiversity. According to the Division Forest Office in Rukum (East), these areas are the main habitat of endangered red panda and pangolins among other wild animals. According to locals, there are also various plant species in the community forests, ponds, rivers and rivulets in these areas. “The local units have started campaigns at the local level to preserve wild animals and plants. It’s a praiseworthy work,” said Samil Pun, a local of Puthauttarganga. According to him, biodiversity conservation is the best way to tackle environmental degradation. In a recent programme organised at Rukum (East), chiefs of Puthauttarganga, Sisne and Banfikot, people representatives and the concerned stakeholders decided to conserve and maintain biodiversity. In the current fiscal year, these local units have prepared a working guideline to implement the decision. Kumari Baral, chairperson of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that increased human activities have badly affected biodiversity. “Our life can only be sustained if we maintain the ecology of the land,” said Baral, adding that they have started awareness programmes in the settlements.Even though red pandas can be commonly seen in Sisne and Puthauttarganga, the concerned authorities have not yet conducted a census survey to determine its population. “We can easily spot red pandas in Puthauttarganga. In the past, we used to chase red pandas from our fields. But now, through awareness programmes, we know that these are rare species and should be preserved,” said Pun. Puthauttarganga Rural Municipality has started to preserve biodiversity by adopting scientific forest management in the community forests. This local unit has also made a working guideline to conserve the habitat of red panda and sustainable use of medicinal herbs. On the other hand, Sisne Rural Municipality has made some policy level decisions for biodiversity conservation. According to the policy, every house in the rural municipality should plant two trees and plant trees saplings in the open areas, said Baral. Mohan Rokamagar, the headmaster of Himalaya Secondary School in Sisne, said that biodiversity should be maintained to preserve the ecosystem. “All of the animals and plant species should be preserved to maintain the ecosystem,” said Rokamagar, referring works of local units as an exemplary.Banfikot Rural Municipality in Rukum (West) too has made a working guideline to preserve pangolins and aquatic species. This local unit is going to manage the scattered settlements into an integrated settlement and promote afforestation programmes. Dharma Bahadur KC, chairman of Banfikot Rural Municipality, said, “If we use natural resources in a haphazard manner, there will be nothing left for our future generation. We should understand this and use natural resources in a scientific way.”Meanwhile, Besindra Raj Subedi, Division Forest Officer, said that forests are the main part of biodiversity. He said, “The ecosystem can only be maintained if forests are conserved. That’s why we will help local units for their conservation efforts.”","Published at : December 20, 2019",Rukum (east),Hari Gautam
Child mortality rate is still alarming in Palpa,"Chandra Bahadur and his wife Laxmi lost their 49-day-old son on November 29. The residents of Somadi Tangsial in Palpa had taken their baby for vaccination to a nearby health camp.“He cried all the way back home after receiving vaccination and a polio drop,” said Laxmi. “He died the same night.” The parents did not make much of the baby crying, thinking that it was “normal” for babies to cry out in pain after vaccination. “We did not take him to a health post because we thought he was doing fine,” said Chandra Bahadur.According to Laxmi, a health worker at the camp had administered four different vaccinations—BCG, PCV, FIPU and DPT—and polio drops to the infant.Laxmi had her delivery in Mission Hospital in Tansen. Her 49-month old child was her eighth and was born prematurely. The newborn had been kept in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at the hospital for 28 days before he was discharged.Dilip Prasad Mahato, chief at Somadi Health Post, said the infant’s death was unusual. “A newborn has to be monitored carefully for 24 hours after receiving a vaccination. Laxmi’s son was born prematurely, which could mean that he might have been born with medical problems,” said Mahato. Despite launching various programmes, including immunisation, safe motherhood and nutrition, the child mortality rate is still alarming in Palpa district.According to the data available at the Health Office in Palpa, 19 children below the age of 28 days died in 2016/17 while the total death of children under five years of age in the same fiscal year was 44. The figure was 22 and 35 respectively in 2017/18. In the fiscal year 2018/19, nine infants under the age of 28 days died while the total death of the children below the age of five was 15.The child mortality rate in the first three months of the current fiscal year 2019/20 has raised concerns among health officials in the district. According to Om Prakash Panthi, the immunisation officer in the district, nine infants died within 28 days of birth while the total death of children below five years of age was 12 in the first three months. According to him, respiratory problems, pneumonia, heart ailments, malnutrition, amentia and diarrhoea are the major reasons behind the death of infants in the district. Bishwanath Neupane, acting chief at the Health Office in Palpa, admitted that efforts have fallen short when it comes to controlling infant mortality rate in the district. “People in remote villages are not educated and therefore are not aware of public health issues. We haven’t been able to penetrate remote areas, and our drives haven’t been effective in controlling infant mortality rate,” said Neupane.Villagers in the remote areas of Palpa do not have easy access to health care services. They have to walk as long as five hours to reach the nearest health facility, which might have contributed to the alarming rate of infant mortality in the district. “We will coordinate with the local units and launch various programmes in remote areas,” Neupane said. According to the National Demographic Health Survey-2016, the neonatal mortality rate in the nation is 21; the infant mortality rate is 32; and the under-five mortality rate is 39.","Published at : December 19, 2019",Palpa,Madhab Aryal
"Drug smugglers find a new, loose route— Siddhartha Highway","The Palpa District Police on July 5 nabbed two men, identified as Suman Gurung and Sagar BK, with two grams and seven milligrams of brown sugar during a security check at Aryabhanjyang in Palpa. Using the men’s mobile phones, the police tracked and arrested two other men, Gaurishankar Tharu and Gobinda Tharu, with the same drug a few weeks later.All these men, between the ages of 20 and 31, are locals, and they had an underground network, say police. The network also included Ramzan Ali, a local of Waling in Syangja, who was nabbed with Rs 15,000 while on his way to purchase the grainy semi-synthetic opioid. Suman, Gaurishankar and Govinda are currently remanded into custody while Sagar and Ramzan have been released on Rs100,000 bail.“It took us quite a lot of effort to navigate through the racket,” said DSP Krishna Raj Sapkota of Palpa District Police. “We have been able to nab several smugglers in the same racket through the arrestees’ mobile phones.”Areas like Jhumsa, Prabhas and Aryabhanjyang over the past couple of years have been fast earning notoriety as a hotspot for drug smugglers, according to Deependra GC, superintendent of police with Palpa District Police. The police have made over a dozen arrests in this period from these areas.The latest among the police’s catch are Kiran Gurung, 31, of Madi in Kaski, and Bishal Nepali, 22, of Arjun Chaupari in Syangja, who were arrested while on their way to Pokhara with drugs of three variety—Diazepam, Noofen and Phenergan—and some money. They were apprehended near Jhumsa in Palpa.During their police statements, the smugglers invariably reported that they purchase drugs in the Sunauli border from Indian dealers, according to the police. Most of the smugglers make Butwal city the centre of their navigation. They don’t deal in big amount but in a few grams, GC said. “They only get a certain amount of drugs from the Indian dealers, and they deal in a smaller amount to lessen the risk of being caught,” GC said. “Because of this, we have only been able to nab some traffickers, but not many dealers.”In the fiscal years 2017/18 and 2018/19, the police have registered a total of 30 cases of illegal drug smuggling. In the first five months of this fiscal year, there have been five registered cases.According to GC, smugglers are often caught while travelling on motorcycles. Many of the arrestees have conceded of trafficking drugs for years. While the police are aware that the Siddhartha Highway is gaining notoriety for drug smuggling, Sapkota said that they can’t perform stringent security check daily for lack of manpower. “We can’t perform strict checks every day,” Sapkota said. “But there’s no doubt this route is being used increasingly to traffic drugs.”","Published at : December 18, 2019",Palpa,Madhav Aryal
Religious leaders are key to immunisation success in Kapilvastu’s Muslim settlements,"Radheshyam Kalwar, the in-charge of Maharajgung Primary Health Care Center of Maharajgunj Municipality in Kapilvastu, has held four meetings with local maulanas (Muslim religious leaders) in the past one year. During this period, he also attended several Friday congregations at local mosques requesting the maulanas to direct the devotees to immunise their children regularly.""Some change can be seen in behavioural patterns of people since we started taking the help of religious scholars and maulanas,"" Kalwar told the Post over the phone from Kapilvastu. ""Without their help and active participation, it is challenging to convince people of our area to avail the health services offered by the government.""Kapilvastu is the only district in the country where the Ministry of Health and Population conducted a mass drug administration programme against filariasis for 11 consecutive years but failed to achieve its target. The coverage of the government’s various health schemes in the district, including adherence of people to immunisation and family planning programmes, is very low compared to other districts. This is particularly more glaring in municipalities like Krishnanagar and Maharajgung, where a vast section of the Muslim population resides. Last year, there was a measles outbreak in several wards of Krishnanagar. Similarly, during the preceding year, there was an outbreak of the highly contagious virus in Maharajgunj.Kalwar said that it is very difficult to convince people to seek healthcare services. Despite having a birthing centre within 500 metres, there are women giving birth at home, risking their lives. They skip immunisation programmes even when health workers reach their village in the outreach camp. Similarly, the trend of going to their maternal homes in India during the time of delivery and returning to their in-laws home after several months has deprived several newly-born children of the immunisation programme.After exhausting their efforts in what seemed like a failing cause, the primary health care centre has adopted a new policy: Take the Maulana into confidence and get access with their help.  ""We have also been inviting males in the meetings of the mothers’ group,"" said Kalwar. ""Men generally do not attend mothers’ group meetings, so we have been holding separate men's meetings.""Dr Jhalak Sharma, chief of immunisation section at the Family Welfare Division, says social as well as health indicators of Dalit Muslim and backward communities have been found to be very low.“People in the Muslim community where the literacy rate is too low, follow the instructions of the Maulana more than that of health workers,” says Sharma.He added: ""After the outbreak, we reached the affected villages and held meetings with the Maulanas. The meetings have been yielding positive results, but it will take time. We have been encouraging health workers to take the help of religious scholars in the health programmes, including our nation-wide campaigns.""","Published at : December 18, 2019",Kathmandu,Arjun Poudel
Special committee recommends Province 5 to be named ‘Lumbini’,"A special advisory committee formed by the Province 5 Assembly to recommend the name and capital of the province has proposed ‘Lumbini’ as the province name. The committee, however, has been unable to recommend a unanimous name for the provincial capital.The 15-member committee headed by Dipendra Kumar Pun Magar submitted its report at the secretariat of the provincial assembly on Monday. The report is yet to be made public. A source at the committee said that the special committee, formed around 16 months ago, recommended three cities—Butwal in Rupandehi district, Chandrauta in Kapilvastu district and Lamahi in Dang district—as the possible capital of Province 5.“We have submitted the report following due analysis based on the suggestions collected from the public and stakeholders in all 12 districts of the province. Details about the report will be made public once it is tabled in the provincial assembly meeting,” said Pun Magar.The Province 5 Assembly formed the committee in July 2018 to study about the possible name/s for the province and its headquarters. The committee carried out the study by forming three technical sub-committees of security experts, environmentalists and geographers. The committee had also collected feedback and suggestions from the common people, professional organisations and several social organisations.According to a member of the special committee, all the members agreed to name the province ‘Lumbini’ unanimously, but they were divided over the issue of naming the capital. “The committee members from the western part of the province were in favour of Lamahi as the capital, whereas members from Kapilvastu and Arghakhanchi lobbied for Chandrauta,” he said. “Other members were in favour of Butwal, the temporary capital of the province, as the permanent capital. The committee has recommended three alternatives for the province as the members failed to reach a consensus.” According to the constitutional provision, the Provincial Assembly can name and designate a province’s capital by a two-thirds majority. There are 87 members in the Province 5 Assembly in total. The ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) has 61 members, the Nepali Congress has 19, Sanghiya Samajbadi Party has five and Rastriya Janamorcha and Rastriya Janata Party have one each in the provincial legislative body.The NCP has a two-thirds majority in the Province 5 Assembly; however, the party too is divided in regards to the capital.The special advisory committee submitted its report over the possible name and capital of the province while the opposition parties have been criticising the provincial government accusing the latter of not resolving the long-standing issue of the name and capital of the province.Nirmala Chhetri, the whip of the main opposition Nepali Congress, remarked that the report submission, albeit late, was a positive step. “Discussions will be held during the upcoming assembly meeting. Our party will continue its pressure to solve the issue of name and capital of the province,” said Chhetri. It is learnt that the provincial government is preparing to summon the assembly meeting by December end.Only three of the seven federal units have been given names and a capital city so far. The provincial assemblies of Province 4, 6 and 7 have named their provinces as Gandaki, Karnali and Sudurpaschim respectively.","Published at : December 17, 2019",Rupandehi,Ghanshyam Gautam
Shiva Community Forest in Bardiya attracts tourists,"Shiva Community Forest, which is adjacent to Bardiya National Park in Dalla, Madhuwan Municipality Ward No. 2, is slowly becoming a popular tourist attraction in Bardiya.Every day, around 50 to 100 domestic and international tourists arrive in the community forest to catch a glimpse of the one-horned rhino and the Royal Bengal Tiger. Parashuram Chaudhary, the ward chairman of Madhuwan Municipality Ward No. 2, said that there are nine rhinos in the forest. He said, “We have estimated that there are seven to 10 tigers in the forest.”Krishna Pariyar, former chairman of Khata Forest Coordination Committee, said that two rhinos of Bardiya National Park had entered the forest a decade ago and have since made the community forest their home.Parashu Tharu, former secretary of the community forest, said that the number of rhinos has been increased every year. He said, “Within the last three years, two rhinos have given birth. Local consumers of the forest even named a rhino calf Shiva.” The community forest covers 104 hectares of land, which is regularly patrolled by a squad of Nepal Army personnel and locals to control poaching of endangered species. Ananath Baral, chief conservation officer of Bardiya National Park, said the Nepal Army had mobilised a small squad in the Dalla area to control poaching and smuggling of endangered species. According to him, there are 37 rhinos in the national park.Because of the security, locals say the community forest is a safe habitat for the endangered rhinos and tigers.Apart from its wildlife, Shiva Community Forest’s homestay facilities are also attracting visitors, according to Mangal Tharu, chairman of Shiva Community Forest. There are 20 homestays operating in Madhuwan Municipality Ward No. 2.","Published at : December 14, 2019",Bardiya,Kamal Panthi
Patients in a Rukum village are returning home untreated as health post lacks manpower,"When Bir Bahadur BK of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality Ward No. 14 fractured one of his hands while fetching fodder for his cattle, he immediately rushed to the nearby Kol primary health post. But unfortunately, he had to return home untreated, as the health post did not have any skilled health personnel. Mangala Budha Magar of the same local unit recounted a similar experience when no one could operate the x-ray machine at the health post.The health post serves patients from at least six wards in three rural municipalities—Putha Uttarganga, Bhume and Sisne. The facility is fairly well-equipped for a primary care health centre. What it lacks is manpower, as a result of which, many patients are compelled to return home untreated or travel some distance elsewhere in the district.Locals say that even though the health post has a designated pool of human resources, they hardly show up. And when they do, they don’t stay for long. Out of the 11 designated positions at the health post, five are currently vacant. Since the former chief doctor, Topendra Karki, was transferred during the employee readjustment, the post has yet to be filled. The health post is currently operated by three Auxiliary Health Workers and Auxiliary Nurse Midwives each and one lab technician. “None of the doctors remain at the rural municipality for long, and those who do don’t show up at the health post regularly,” said Bahadur Sunar, a local of Ward No. 12. Ganga Pun, chief of ward no. 12 and chair of the health post management committee, admitted that patients are deprived of primary care due to a lack of manpower. “Health personnel posted here always want to transfer to other places,” Pun said. “It might be because of the remoteness of the rural municipality. None of the personnel at the post has served full time yet.”After the federal government ignored the rural municipality’s call to send workers to Kol health post, the local unit tried to take matters into its hand and issued a vacancy notice for the available positions. But, according to Pun, nobody has applied yet.","Published at : December 14, 2019",Rukum (east),Hari Gautam
Tilottama Secondary School in Palpa adopts technical education for the first time,"Sunil Dhungana, a student of Tilottama Secondary School in Tinau Rural Municipality, says he enjoys going to school these days. The reason being that his school has started conducting classes on a new subject that Dhungana finds very interesting. The school has introduced the Council for Technical Education and Vocational Training (CTEVT), an 18-month course, to make students employment-ready when they complete their school education. It is the second school in Province 5 and the first in the district to start technical education.Dhungana, who is from Bagnaskali Rural Municipality, is learning automobile repair works. “The subject is very interesting. It will also provide us with practical knowledge,” said Dhungana. Like Dhungana, there are 22 students, including those from neighbouring Bagnaskali and Rainadevi rural municipalities, who are taking theoretical classes on automobile repair for the time being.The school has specifically chosen automobile repair as a subject for the technical course since the area sees a massive traffic flow, said Pramod Karki, a trainer at the school. “We will start practical classes in a month. These students will be able to find jobs easily, as they will be skilled enough to repair small and large vehicles,” said Karki.In the current fiscal year, Tinau Rural Municipality has allocated 13.3 million for the school’s infrastructure development. Jhabindra Gyawali, the school headmaster, said the school decided to run technical education classes after consulting with guardians and the rural municipal office. “The students who have passed their Secondary Education Examination have been admitted to the programme. They will learn skills to get a job after the course’s completion,” said Gyawali, adding that the objective of the school is to make students economically independent. The technical class runs from 6 am to 9 am every day. After 10 am, students join their regular classes, he said. According to the school administration, the school charges an admission fee of Rs 5,000 and a fee of Rs 65,000 for the 18-month course. “75 percent of our classes have practical lessons; therefore, this course is expensive,” said Gyawali.","Published at : December 12, 2019",Jhumsa (palpa),Madhav Aryal
"Forty-two years on, Lumbini Master Plan is still incomplete","The Lumbini Master Plan, conceived 42 years ago, was developed with a sole ambition: to develop Lumbini, a historical site that sprawls across three square miles in the country’s plains. Till date, the plan has absorbed more than thrice the budget that was initially estimated and seen 38 deputy chairpersons (federal minister of tourism assumes the role of the chairperson)—all of whom, upon their appointment, vowed to lead the plan to a logical conclusion.Fast forward to the tail end of 2019, and only 85 percent of the work is completed, inviting criticism from all quarters towards the government and the Trust. Many say the snail’s pace of work has affected the identity and glory of Lumbini. “When a project remains incomplete for all these years, it’s obvious that criticisms will arise,” Abdesh Kumar Tripathi, the Trust’s incumbent deputy chair, said. “But it’s not been too long since Lumbini was inducted as a national pride project. And now the work is moving forward.” Tripathi said the remaining work will be completed within three years.Fifty years ago, in 1967, an international committee—comprising 13 Buddhist countries—was founded to develop Lumbini as a major Buddhist destination. The committee was anchored by U Thant, the then Secretary-General of the United Nations, who visited Lumbini and called the international community to support Lumbini’s development. The committee was a result of Thant’s efforts. The master plan was designed by Kenzō Tange, an eminent Japanese architect, and was approved by the Nepal Government and the United Nations in 1978. The plan was supposed to be completed by 1995. In 1985, the Lumbini Development Trust was established to accelerate the work.Led by Tange, the committee formulated the extensive master plan in 1978. The plan demarcated the three square kilometres of Lumbini into three zones—the Sacred Garden, the Monastic Zone, and the Cultural Centre and New Lumbini Village. There’s little hint when these zones will come to full being.Like almost all quarters of the Nepali cultural life, political interference, many believe, is what has hindered the project from being completed. “The main reason that the master plan hasn’t yet come to fruition is the appointment of the deputy chair of the Trust on the basis of political affiliation,” Fakharuddin Khan, a member of Province-5 parliament, said. “The change in government directly affects the plan.” Khan further said that the deputy chairs of the Trust don’t get enough time to enforce their vision, with their tenure cut short with every change in government. “Another problem is that those appointed through their political affiliation can’t go beyond their party agendas,” Khan added.Despite decades-long delays, however, the plan is now coming to fruition, according to Saroj Bhattarai, chief of plan and member-secretary of Lumbini Development Trust. “We are soon consulting with experts regarding the design, manpower and inspection of the remaining work,” he said. “We will issue a tender immediately after the discussion.”The Trust took a year to select the consulting company, Telecommunication Consultant of India JV CIAAS Nepal, which will provide the roadmap to complete the remaining work of the project, which will take about Rs 6 billion, according to Bhattarai. Bhattarai said that the consultant has been given a clear order to formulate a plan to complete the project within three years. The remaining work includes the building of Lumbini Culture Centre, an auditorium, a drinking water tank, footpaths, a parking lot, residence for employees, a blacktopped road, diversion of Telar River, beautification of the entire site, electricity supply, and telecommunication, among others.","Published at : December 10, 2019",Lumbini,Madhav Dhungana
Kohalpur tense after a truck hits a student,"Tension ran high in Kohalpur of Banke district throughout the day on Sunday after a truck hit a student at around 10 am, leaving her seriously injured. Twelve-year-old Prakriti Chand, a seventh grader, was hit by the truck (Na 2 Kha 9459) in front of Tribhuvan School where she studies. The accident occurred as her father, Nagendra Bahadur Chand, was about to return home after dropping her off in front of the school. “The truck hit her while she was crossing the road through a zebra crossing. I could not believe my eyes. The school students encircled the truck and I rushed her to the nearby hospital for treatment,” said Nagendra, who runs an eatery to make a living for his six-member family. Prakriti, who lost both her legs in the accident, was airlifted to Kathmandu at around 3 pm on Sunday. “My daughter survived the deadly accident but she lost her legs,” the victim’s father told the Post over the telephone.The students took to the streets after the incident and they were soon joined by locals. The protesters set the truck on fire, claiming that the truck driver reversed the vehicle with the intention to crush the victim to death. Ram Safal Chaudhary, the school guard who was witness to the accident, said that the truck dragged the victim for a few metres and attempted to crush her to death by reversing the vehicle.The situation turned ugly after a team of police, led by Deputy Superintendent of Police Hem Bahadur Shahi, started beating the protesting students and the locals indiscriminately. ""The protest intensified when police started beating up the protesters instead of containing the situation,” said Dev Narayan Karki, a student. ""Shahi started beating me up, and when I tried to stop him he asked me who was I to stop the police.”According to Karki, a scuffle ensued as protesters started pelting stones. Police then responded by firing in the air and lobbing tear gas shells.Raj Bahadur Chaudhary, Shahi’s bodyguard, said that Shahi was also injured in the incident. “He is receiving treatment at Kohalpur Medical College,” said Chaudhary.According to Superintendent of Police Bir Bahadur Oli, more than 100 rounds of rubber bullets and tear gas shells were fired to contain the situation.Police firing further prompted protests and the agitated crowd vandalised the area police unit building along with a dozen vehicles parked outside.Protesters have accused the police of inciting violence instead of ensuring security in Kohalpur on Sunday. The agitated locals are now demanding Shahi’s transfer.Krishna Kanta Upadhyaya, assistant chief district officer of Banke, said the administration was mulling over a curfew if the situation does not improve.At least 19 people, including students and security personnel, were injured in the scuffle. Ten seriously injured victims were taken to Kathmandu for treatment. The driver of the truck has been taken into police custody, according to Oli.","Published at : December 8, 2019",Banke,Madhu Shahi
Banke National Park to release gharials into the Rapti river,"Banke National Park is preparing to release endangered gharials (Gavialis gangetics) into the Rapti river.Shivakhola, Sikta and Gabhar areas, which fall under the national park area, have been identified as major habitats of gharials. This is the first time the national park has taken initiatives to release gharials into Banke’s Rapti river. Officials said that Gharials will be brought to Rapti from Chitwan.“There’s enough prey [fish] available in the Shivakhola area. That is why this area has been categorised as the best place for gharial conservation,” said Lalmani Bhandari, assistant chief conservation officer of the park, adding that visitors can catch a glimpse of gharials in the national park area soon.Park officials said that 55 species of fish are found in various rivers and streams inside the park. “Gharials are at risk due to a shortage of prey in the rivers and streams. But in Banke, that is not a problem,” said Bhandari, adding that this move will boost tourism numbers in the park and also conserve gharials.Conservationists said that they also have to make locals living near the national park aware about gharial conservation—particularly about keeping water sources clear. Gharials prefer living in the clean water of free-flowing rivers. “If a river or stream is polluted, there are neither fish nor gharials present,” said Bhandari, adding that they have been making efforts to coordinate with the local community to conserve gharials.Gharial was listed as a critically endangered species in the Red Data Book of the World Conservation Union in 2007. In Nepal, gharials have been enlisted as a protected species. Nepal began conservation of gharials by establishing a breeding centre in Kasara, of Chitwan, in 1976. Every year, gharials from the breeding centres are released into the Rapti and Narayani, as well as two other rivers in western Nepal—Babai and Karnali. As per the latest census, there are 118 gharials in Rapti and 101 in Narayani.As per the existing legal provisions in the country, one is sentenced one to 10 years in jail or a fine ranging from Rs 100,000 to Rs 500,000 or both if one is found poaching a gharial.","Published at : December 8, 2019",Banke,Thakur Singh Tharu
"Tilaurakot, where Siddhartha Gautam spent his early years, ignored in Visit Nepal Year 2020 publicity campaigns","Visit Nepal Year 2020 is less than a month away and to make it a success, various publicity programmes have been launched in and outside the country. However, a historic destination Tilaurakot, in Kapilvastu, has been left out of all publicity campaigns and preparedness efforts, according to the District Coordination Committee in Kapilvastu.“Tilaurakot is a significant part of Nepal’s history because this was where Siddartha Gautam spent 29 years of his life before he chose the path of enlightenment,” said Narayan Khanal, chief of the District Coordination Committee in Kapilvastu. “This place has always fallen under the authorities’ radar. But for Visit Nepal Year 2020, Tilaurakot has been left out of published materials for Visit Nepal Year 2020 campaign.”Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation, the Nepal Tourism Board and the Visit Year Secretariat have not included photos of Tilaurakot in posters, pamphlets, brochures and booklets that they published, says Khanal. “More than 500 photos of various spots in the country have been uploaded in the official Facebook page of Visit Nepal Year 2020 but that of Tilaurakot is conspicuously missing,” he said.A joint team of archaeologists from Durham University in the United Kingdom, along with members from the Department of Archaeology and Lumbini Development Trust have been carrying out excavation work of Tilaurakot for the past six years. During the excavation, it was found that there was a human settlement in the Tilaurakot area in the 8th century BC highlighting the historical significance this city carries.Rajesh Gyawali, a member of the Lumbini Development Trust, said that Tilaurakot was omitted in the publicity programmes by mistake. “We have already asked Nepal Tourism Board and other authorities concerned authorities to include Tilaurakot in the publicity materials. They will hopefully address our request soon,” he added. Raj Kumar Yadav, a local tour guide of Tilaurakot, expressed his displeasure for ignoring the historic place in the publicity campaign. “Tilaurakot sees the second-highest number of visitors to the district after Lumbini, yet it is one of the most neglected places, ” said Yadav. “It is unfortunate that Tilaurakot hasn’t been promoted for Visit Nepal Year 2020. The authorities should correct this and include Tilaurakot in the publicity materials,” said Brijesh Kumar Gupta, a federal lawmaker from Tilaurakot. He said that he raised the issue in the House of Representatives but that it went unheard. Besides Tilaurakot, there are several other historically and archaeologically important places in Kapilvastu. Nigrodham, where Gautam Buddha first met his parents after his enlightenment, is also located in the district.“Tilaurakot is the Shakyamuni capital and it deserves publicity and promotion but that hasn’t happened,” said Kiran Singh, mayor of Kapilvastu Municipality.","Published at : December 6, 2019",Kapilvastu,Manoj Paudel
"Every winter, the poor in Tarai are left to battle the cold alone","A Musahhar settlement in Pratappur in the plains is comprised of a hastily put together shanty village. Around 50 families live in the settlement, who, come winter, are seen scrambling for warm clothes, blankets, and food.“We have neither warm clothes to wear nor blankets to beat the biting cold. I have a family of six and my income as a daily wage worker is not enough to buy us warmth for winter,” said Bamati Musahar.Almost all the adults in the settlement eke out their living as labourers. The past one week has seen dense fog enveloping the settlement in the morning and the bleak afternoon sun provides little relief. Come nightfall, the families huddle around a fire to keep themselves warm. “The weather is turning colder by the day. We face the same ordeal every winter; that of not enough clothes and shelter,” said Bamati. The local units and various organisations run a distribution drive every winter but it starts only in the last week of December and sometimes in January. “It’s already cold but the distribution materials are yet to come,” laments Bamati.The data of the District Natural Disaster Rescue Committee showed that there are more than 3,000 Musahar, Dalit and other impoverished families living in Nawalparasi (West). Many impoverished households are going to face a difficult time this winter.Raj Kumar Sharma, chairman of Pratappur Rural Municipality, however, said the local body has allocated budget to provide warm clothes and blankets for the needy people from poor communities. He, however, did not specify the budget that had been issued for the same. Chief District Officer Shambhu Prasad Marasini directed the chief of the local units, head of the government offices, representatives of the political parties, chamber of commerce and industry and various social organisations regarding the preparedness for the cold wave. “We have held discussions over the management of relief materials and preparedness strategies recently,” said Marasini.The cold wave affects normal life mainly in Tarai districts every winter and the authorities are criticised for their poor preparedness every year. Ramji Gyawali, a rights activist working on social justice in the district, said that the authorities should take initiatives to protect the poor communities, old people, postpartum mothers and children from the cold conditions on time.“Every year, the concerned authorities take initiatives to help needy people after the end of winter. If the victims do not receive relief on time, such programmes become meaningless,” Gyawali said. According to him, the people’s representatives should take prompt measures to distribute warm clothes and bedding before the cold sets in in earnest.","Published at : November 30, 2019",Parasi,Nabin Paudel
Lumbini hosts sarus crane festival to raise awareness on the endangered bird,"With an objective of preserving sarus cranes (Grus antigone), the world’s tallest flying bird, the Lumbini Development Trust organised a sarus cranes festival.The sarus cranes festival was organised on the premises of World Peace Pagoda in Lumbini. It was the first festival of its kind dedicated to the species.“Sarus cranes’ conservation has become quite challenging now due to the increasing use of insecticides and pesticides in the fields, human encroachment and shrinking cultivable land,”said Abdhesh Kumar Tripathi, vice-chairman of the trust. “The festival thus was organised to raise awareness among people about the importance of its conservation,” he added. Aside from garnering visibility for the bird species, the festival has also worked as a platform to attract tourists to the Lumbini area.The sarus crane is mostly found in the Indian Sub-continents and in Nepal, where Lumbini is its major habitat. The large non-migratory bird was enlisted in the IUCN red list of threatened species in 2000 after its population dwindled.According to conservationists, the number of the threatened species has been decreasing in the country in recent years. They said live electricity wires and stray dogs are major threats for sarus cranes. The birds are at risk of being electrocuted when they come in contact with live electricity wires and become prey to stray dogs while on the fields foraging for food.Talking to the Post, ornithologist Hemsagar Baral said that there could be around 500 sarus cranes in Nepal at present. Among them, about 300 are found in Kapilvastu, Rupandehi and Nawalparasi districts.During the festival, a photo exhibition of the bird species was also organised. The festival also organised a drawing and essay writing competition among the students of various secondary schools in the area on the theme of bird conservation.The Lumbini Development Trust had signed an agreement with International Crane Foundation of the USA in 1994 and involved in sarus crane conservation in the area.","Published at : November 29, 2019",Lumbini,Manoj Paudel
Fake doctors are conning villagers in Banke,"Not long after they returned home from an evening walk, Gayaraj Dhobi and Malikraj Dhobi, aged 26 and 28, suffered a persistent stomach ache. Malikraj, who by relation is Gayaraj’s brother-in-law, was at the latter’s house, in Narainapur, for a family ritual. Once the ceremony was over, the two had gone out for some fresh air.When the two complained of the ache, Kushma Dhobi, Gayaraj’s wife, called Rajesh Singh, whom everyone in the village knew as a doctor. Singh provided a variety of medicines to the patients, but it didn’t work, Kushma recalls. There were given saline and often injections. Gayaraj passed away in the wee hours of Monday morning. Malikraj was scurried to Nepalgunj but died on the way.Narainapur, a rural municipality in Banke, is a sprawling settlement across the Rapti River, 35 km south-east from Nepalgunj. The settlement is surrounded by Chure hills on one side and the river on the other. It is a quiet, deserted village on the margins that hardly sees any outsiders. The locals have been keeping up with the barebones, waiting for hospitals, road networks, school, electricity. The village health post perennially runs out of resources. For decades, villagers like Kushma have been resorting for treatment to people like Singh should the body face any complication.Ramsaroj, Gayaraj’s father, blames Singh for his son and son-in-law’s death. Ramsaroj believes Singh is a quack, masquerading as a doctor while he has little medical expertise. “Singh ran away killing my son,” he says. “He gave way too many medicines, none of which worked.”Chitra Bahadur KC, a local, said the villagers have no option than see people like Singh. “The health post has nothing besides paracetamol tabs,” KC said. “We are compelled to take help from those like Singh. Something is better than nothing.” Ram Ferhan Godiya, who had seen Singh for a stomach ailment two years ago, said Singh’s medication did nothing for him. “He promised all would be okay,” said Godiya. “But it didn’t. I had to go to Nepalgunj and discover that I had a wound inside my stomach. It turned out that Singh had given me medicines without knowing what the disease was.”After the recent incident, Singh is on the run. So is another “doctor” Mahesh Gupta who has a clinic in the same village.The area police are currently searching for both, according to Man Bahadur BC, in-charge of the Bhagwanpur-based area police office. “We are trying to arrest all the quacks masquerading as doctors,” BC said. “No medical mafia is allowed in this area.”The rural municipality’s deputy chair, Jayanti Devi Shrivastav, however, said she is not aware of such quacks—who the locals call “jhole doctors”. “I don’t know about such medical clinics set up by medical professionals of little expertise,” said Shirvastav.Narainapur is a local unit of six wards and 45,000 people. There are six health posts and 35 medical clinics operating illicitly. Many cases of the deaths caused by the quacks don’t generate much discussion.The quacks, locals say, go to India after grade 10, where they receive training for a year or two in little-known clinics and return to the village. Then they set up clinics and start treating the villagers. They are popular because the health posts lack resources. The rural municipality’s health coordinator, Moin Khan, however, said the health posts do not ask for medicine supply.“In some cases, we have found those doctors providing banned medicines,” said Binay Dixit, a local. “But people go to them because there’s no option for immediate treatment.”After news about the two youth’s death spread, a joint team from the medicine management department and district administration office reached Narainapur on Wednesday. The team raided three clinics, according to Ninu Shrestha, chief of the department’s Nepalgunj branch. The team padlocked and confiscated medicines from the clinic owned by Singh.“We have done a public inquiry deed at the clinics,” Shrestha said. “We will punish them if found guilty.”Deputy Chief District Officer Krishna Kanta Upadhyay said they have detected clinics operating illegally in the area and that the legal process will move forward after the visiting team files a report of their findings.","Published at : November 29, 2019",Banke,Rupa Gahatraj
Butwal Sub-metropolis implements programme to end incidents of sexual abuse in schools,"In November last year, a tenth-grade student filed a complaint at the local police accusing her school principal, Toyaram Paudel, of repeatedly molesting her.As per the complaint filed by the student’s relatives, the Area Police Office in Butwal detained Paudel and filed a sexual assault charge against him. He was released a few months ago, and the case is now pending at the High Court in Tulsipur.After the incident came to light, the student, out of fear of being chastised by her classmates and teachers, discontinued her education in the school. She enrolled in another one and will be giving her Secondary Education Examinations this year.This is not a lone incident in Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City. Reports of sexual abuse in educational institutions have surfaced before too, say locals. In a bid to ensure these incidents do not repeat and to assure guardians that students are learning in a safe environment, the Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City is launching a programme to raise awareness on bullying and sexual abuse.“We decided to launch the programme to make schools friendlier and safer for children, as we believe that incidents of molestation, harassment and misconduct are going unchecked,” said Guma Devi Acharya, deputy mayor of Butwal. “Several studies and reports have pointed out that schoolgirls are more prone to gender violence. We think that a gender-friendly, equal environment in schools will certainly help eliminate such instances from occuring again and provide safe learning opportunities to students, especially girls.” Under the programme, every school is supposed to assign a focal person, a counsellor of sorts. The focal person’s job is to promptly take initiatives to resolve any complaints that are filed by students. The sub-metropolis has also urged schools to install at least one complaint box, manage separate toilets, etc. The programme has been launched under the guidelines set by the federal government two years ago. On Monday, the sub-metropolis held an interactive session with the principal/headmaster of various schools and other stakeholders regarding implementation of the working guidelines. There are altogether 57 community and institution schools in Butwal Sub-metropolis.“Complaint boxes have been installed in every school, and students have been encouraged to drop their complaints,” said Prem Bahadur Basnet, headmaster at Nabin Audyogik Kadar Bahadur Rita School, in Butwal.The sub-metropolis hopes that the programme will also help in decreasing the dropout rate among girls. “It is essential to make teachers work towards ending any activity that threatens the safety of students in schools,” said Mitramani Khanal, chief of the education unit of the sub-metropolis.","Published at : November 28, 2019",Butwal,Amrita Anmol
Butaha residents initiate afforestation drive to control erosion,"Around three decades ago, the flooded Man stream swept away scores of houses in Butaha village of Bardiya. Those displaced from the settlement at the eastern side of the stream had moved to the western side and settled there. However, the flow of the river has now turned westward, putting the settlement at direct risk of floods. To control soil erosion along the riverbanks, the residents of the settlement in Badhaiyatal Rural Municipality have thus taken initiatives to develop a plant nursery into a community forest. The proposed forest is to be named Dorahawa Community Forest. Shambhu Prasad Chaudhary, a local, said over the years, the stream has been gradually eroding the walls of the river. “Immediate measures to control soil erosion are necessary, so we have decided to develop the small nursery into a community forest,” he said.Some of the locals have even donated their land for the villagers to plant trees on. “I handed over my land, which was near the nursery, to expand the forest. It’s important to have forest cover to save our settlement from flooding and erosion,” said Motiram Tharu, a resident of Butaha.Nine local residents provided four bighas of land in total for the expansion of the community forest. The forest cover now stands at 10 bighas of land. In the first phase, the locals have started planting tree saplings in four bighas of land. Lalluram Chaudhary, the coordinator of the Dorahawa Community Forest Implementation Committee, said, “The entire village is participating in the afforestation drive to protect it from erosion.” Deepa Gautam, deputy chief of the rural municipality, said the local unit has taken initiatives to construct an embankment along the stream to control erosion.","Published at : November 28, 2019",Bardiya,Thakur Singh Tharu
19 dead after bus falls off a cliff in Arghakhanchi,"Nineteen people died when a passenger bus crashed in Narapani of Arghakhanchi district on Wednesday. Thirteen others were injured in the accident, said police.According to the District Police Office, the bus (Lu 2 Kha 2148) was on its way to Butwal from Sandhikharka, the district headquarters of Arghakhanchi, when the incident occurred. The vehicle swerved off a narrow bend in Ratamata and plunged around 500 metres down the road.Police said 17 people died on the spot while two succumbed to injuries in course of treatment. Of the deceased, 12 are male and seven are female. The deceased are yet to be identified.The security personnel struggled for about four hours to rescue the injured and collect the bodies. “The rescue work was quite difficult as the incident site is in difficult terrain. The security personnel reached the site by using ropes,” said Chief District Officer Bijayaraj Paudel.Deputy Superintendent of Police Prakash Bista said that 11 seriously injured were rushed to Butwal while two others are receiving treatment at the district hospital in Sandhikharka.","Published at : November 27, 2019",Arghakhanchi,Birendra KC
"Women in rural Nepal still ashamed of reproductive health issues, health workers say","Sushila Pariyar suffered from uterine prolapse when she gave birth to her first child at the age of 22. Pariyar, who is now 66, didn’t tell her family about the incident until she was 63. Despite her condition, she gave birth to five more children. It was only recently that she underwent surgery after she found out about the dangers of uterine prolapse on a radio show.Bhawani Chaudhary, of Naya Basti in Ghorahi, shares a similar story. Chaudhary, 80, had been suffering from piles for a long time but never sought treatment out of shame. She only recently went for a check-up. The disease has now taken root and needs extensive medication and surgery, but her family doesn’t have enough money to seek treatment.Many women like Pariyar and Chaudhary keep their disease a secret, ashamed of what family members and society at large will say. “I have had complications related to my stomach for a long time, but I did not seek medication,” said Basanta Chaudhary, 80, from Surkeydangi.These women, along with many others, reached a free women’s health camp at Buka in Ghorahi. Most of these women are suffering from diseases related to uterus and many of them have physical injuries from domestic abuse meted out to them. Ishwori Thapa, the coordinator of the camp, said, “Many women don’t share or talk about complications related to reproductive health and physical injuries caused by abuse. But only medical help will not suffice; they need counselling too.” Out of the 174 women who visited the camp, 33 had uterus-related complications, according to Binod Singh, a doctor from Rapti Regional Hospital, Tulsipur, who was at the camp.Singh said that even though the government hospitals provide free treatment, many do not avail of them then because they are unaware of the services. “Even if they are aware of the free treatment, young women choose to stay away and let the disease fester rather than talk about it,” he said.“We managed the free camp so that women who are busy with household chores can come and get a check-up done,” said Narulal Chaudhary, mayor of Ghorai sub-metropolis which coordinated the camp. “The camp has proven effective.”","Published at : November 27, 2019",Dang,Durgalal KC
"Construction of the Tinau corridor starts, but conservationists decry the move","To promote tourism in Lumbini, the federal government has started the construction of the Tinau corridor in Rupandehi district.The Tinau river, which originates in Palpa district, bifurcates from Tinau bridge at Butwal. The separated river is known as Danab river. These two rivers again meet at Mayadevi Rural Municipality. As part of the Tinau corridor, a two-lane road (seven metres wide) is being constructed on both sides of the rivers. In the fiscal year 2018/19, the Department of Roads had prepared a Detailed Project Report (DPR) of the road. “In the first phase, 35 kms of the road will be constructed along the Tinau river and 15 kms will be constructed near the Danab river,” said Meghraj Marasini, chief at the Division Road Office in Butwal. “Retaining walls will also be constructed on both sides of the Tinau river. The road will also have a boulevard (3 metres wide) and a footpath on both sides.” The first phase of the corridor will start from Chidiyakhola in Butwal, which will be linked to Bhairahawa-Lumbini road stretch. In the second phase, the road will expand up to Marchawar area of Sammarimai Rural Municipality along the Nepal-India border area.Bishnu Paudel, former finance minister who is General Secretary of Nepal Communist Party, said that they have started the construction of the corridor to develop the area as a tourist destination. He said, “Tourists who come to visit Lumbini can also visit the corridor.”A total of Rs 450 million has been allocated for the construction of the corridor in the current fiscal year. The Division Road Office in Butwal will start the construction process in accordance with the Detailed Project Report. Marasini said that tenders will be called on the basis of the report for the corridor this year. “We will work with Butwal Sub Metropolis and Shankar Nagar area in Tilottama this year,” said Marasini, adding that the construction work of other areas will be initiated in the next fiscal year. River experts, however, are unhappy with the unfolding of events. They say that the Tinau river needs 237 metres of river area (the space from where water flows), but currently, the river area covers only 50 to 70 metres (in breadth). Khetraj Dahal, an expert on river management and biodiversity, has advised the concerned authority to verify the exact area of the river before starting construction of the road—to avoid future risks. “In-depth research and studies should be conducted before the authorities move ahead with the construction. Any project of this calibre must first be studied thoroughly to avoid flood risks,” he said. Marasini, however, said that they have invited experts to study the river area before construction begins in full swing.Yubaraj Kandel, a local resident who has spent his life by the Tinau river, is not sold on the idea of the corridor. There are many demerits of constructing the corridor, he says. “The road construction will dry up the water sources of the river and destroy the natural vegetation.” According to him, there should be a large boulevard and enough river area to maintain the ecology of both the rivers. “Otherwise, the Tinau river will become more of a canal and less of a river than it is today,” he said.","Published at : November 26, 2019",Butwal,Amrita Anmol
Lack of budget to implement master plan for the conservation of Satyawati Lake,"Tinau Rural Municipality in Palpa district had prepared a master plan for the conservation of the Satyawati Lake in the fiscal year 2018/19. The plan revolved around developing the area as an important tourist destination in the country.However, no budget was allocated for the plan to the Satyawati Lake Conservation Committee, which is responsible to implement the project, in the last fiscal year. The provincial government did not release the budget—more than Rs 10 million—this fiscal year either. “Satyawati Lake Conservation Committee doesn’t have even Rs 1 million to launch conservation campaigns. We have a master plan but we don’t have the money. We have asked the local unit to step in to help us implement the master plan,” said Tilbir Rana, chairman of the committee. According to the master plan, the Satyawati area is to have two temples —Satyawati Baje and Bajai. The plan states the Bajai temple (the bigger of the two), pathways and a garden is to be constructed in the periphery of the lake. Besides that, the construction of a small temple (Baje temple) in the middle of the lake and water management in the lake is also proposed in the master plan.Satyawati Lake, set in an area of around five ropanies of land, lies at 1,300 metres altitude. The lake is around 35 kilometres from Tansen, the district headquarters of Palpa district. The lake usually dries up during mid-April to mid-June. However, there are scientific ways to keep the lake alive even during the dry seasons but that will require mammoth conservation efforts from the concerned authorities, said Sunbir Gaha, a local. He said, “The concerned authority should plan to replenish the lake even in the dry season. The lake supports a variety of fish and plant species and their conservation all year round should be prioritised.” In this fiscal year, the committee collected around Rs 1.4 million from a three-day fair conducted in Satyawati. The committee had spent Rs 511,000 to organise the fair and 30 percent of the collected amount was handed over to the rural municipal office, said Rana. He said, “As we invested around half of the collected amount in the fair and deposited 30 percent of the income to the rural municipal office, we don’t have sufficient budget now. We need aid from the local and provincial governments to implement the master plan.” The President Chure-Tarai Madhes Conservation Development Committee had also spent Rs 1.1 million for the development of the Satywati area in the two fiscal years 2015/16 and 2016/17. Dan Bahadur Gaha, one of the ward chairmen of the rural municipality, said that the amount was spent to clean the lake, construct sheds, water tanks, fences, roads, and homestays among others.In the running fiscal year, the provincial government has allocated Rs 500,000 for the development of Satyawati area which the locals and the conservation committee feel is too little given the ambitious master plan. The rural municipality has spent the allocated amount on the construction of roads and other infrastructure. Gaha said, “We will not be able to work according to the master plan this year either. We will make efforts to have the required budget passed and start work in accordance with the master plan in the next fiscal year.”","Published at : November 25, 2019",Satyawati (palpa),Madhav Aryal
"Child marriage cases on the rise but police complaints scarce, say child activists","Diksha BK, a teenager from Kapilvastu, says she is aware of the number of child marriages taking place around her. She is a member of a children’s club and says she wants to protest the practice.“But society doesn’t support us,” she said. “Even if we report the cases to the police, they do not pay much attention to it. Local units are indifferent and don’t have any plan or policies to curb the practice.” What’s more exasperating, BK says, is that those inciting child marriages are not punished. “The situation is frustrating,” she said.“We have launched several campaigns against the practice but that hasn’t changed the people’s mindset,” said Sagar Tharu, who is also a member of the children’s club in Kapilvastu. “What we want is support from society, local units and the police.”BK and Tharu were participants of a conference against child marriage that took place in the Capital on Wednesday, marking International Children’s Day. Many children speaking at the conference said that child marriage is still rampant in many parts of the country and is a major threat to children’s rights. According to a survey by Good Neighbour International and Kidark Nepal, 46.9 percent of total marriages in the country are child marriages, including 69.7 percent love marriages and 30.26 arranged marriages. The survey was conducted among 1,032 teenagers and their parents from over a dozen districts.“Many of our friends are getting married, but society hasn’t paid heed to stop it,” said Shreya Adhikari, another participant. “The efforts of the club only have proved insufficient.”Geeta Chaudhary, former chair of Network of Children’s Club, Kanchanpur, said that child marriage is in practice in the veneer of various traditions and rituals. “In the Tharu community, one’s marriage is fixed the moment one takes birth,” Chaudhary said. “And the child in question is married off before she reaches legally marriageable age.”Speaking at the conference, DIG Pitambar Adhikari of Children, Women and Senior Citizen Directorial of Police Headquarters said that the police receive only nominal complaints regarding child marriage. “Even though the cases are on the rise, we get only a few complaints,” said Adhikari. “If society is willing to speak up, then we can start punishing the illicit marriages.”Child marriage has been illegal in Nepal since 1963. Two years ago, the government increased the legal age for marriage from 18 to 20. As per Article 173 of the Criminal Code, a person found guilty of either committing or arranging a child marriage is subject to a jail term of up to three years and a fine of Rs 30,000. However, in many cases, these legal provisions, aimed at protecting children from child marriage, have ended up being used to penalise them instead.","Published at : November 21, 2019",Dang,Durgalal KC
Overcrowded Rolpa District Prison in dilapidated condition,"The eight-room Rolpa District Prison, built 37 years ago, was originally meant to hold 40 prisoners, but it currently houses 86 inmates. This overcrowding might lead to an outbreak of diseases, said Krishna Dangi, a health worker at the local health post. “Sixty-five prisoners fell ill a couple of months back. The prison is a breeding ground for communicable diseases,” Dangi said.The prison, spread across six ropanis of land, is in a dilapidated condition. Although the provincial government had allocated Rs10 million for the construction of a new prison, the prison administration’s failure to acquire land has prevented it from utilising the budget.""The project has yet to take off we have been unable to find a suitable land plot,"" said Laxman Dhakal, chief district officer of Rolpa. “We are looking for land in Libang, the headquarters of the district, and its surrounding areas.""The current location of the prison is unsuitable, as there are two private buildings, a school and the office of the public prosecutor looming tall in close proximity. “The prison, which is surrounded by tall buildings, is not safe for prisoners,” said Yam Lal Oli, the jailer of Rolpa District Prison.However, Oli is worried not just about the prisoners’ safety but also the local residents. In the last 10 years, there have been three cases of prison breakouts in which more than a dozen prisoners escaped by digging a tunnel through the prison boundary wall. “Some of the escaped prisoners are still at large. Some are hardened criminals, but the poor infrastructure of the prison made it easy for them to break out,” said Oli.The prison administration and staff are also suffering from a lack of space and proper physical infrastructure. “The prison currently runs from a rented building. It’s difficult for prison employees to work effectively in the absence of a proper office setup,” said CDO Dhakal.There have been numerous attempts to demolish the old prison building and construct a new one, but every effort has gone in vain. ""Several initiatives were taken in the past to shift the prison and make it more secure,"" said Diwakar Acharya, a former jailer of Rolpa District Prison.""But the land issue has hindered the process.” Meanwhile, according to Oli, the budget allocated for building a new prison does not meet the cost of land. “We have the budget to build a new prison, but the given budget is not enough to buy land. Residents of Reugha had agreed to provide the prison with 20 ropanis of land, but no agreement has been reached yet,” Oli said.Because of the overcrowding and poor facility, the prison, which aims to be a reform centre, has not been able to create a conducive environment for prisoners to learn and grow their skills. “We don’t even have enough toilets,” said Oli.The District Security Committee had advised the prison administration to sell the existing plot of land and shift the prison to a new location. Locals and the administration have raised this issue with political leaders and bureaucrats, but in the absence of proper planning, both repair works and initiatives to shift the prison to a secure location are in limbo.""We regularly notify the Department of Prison Management on the recommendations given to the prison by judges of district and high courts, rights activists and journalists, who often visit the prison to check the living conditions of prisoners, but our requests go unheard,"" said Oli.The written reports on the condition of the prison were submitted to the then Deputy Prime Minister Krishna Bahadur Mahara as well as Barsha Man Pun, current energy minister and former finance minister.""We continue to house prisoners in this dilapidated structure which is becoming more insecure with every passing day. For now, we have increased the number of security personnel and are working towards repairing the current structure,"" said Oli.","Published at : November 19, 2019",Rolpa,Kashiram Dangi
Modern science labs and libraries built in all of Butwal's community schools,"In a bid to enhance the quality of education in the area, the Butwal Sub Metropolis has established a modern science laboratory and library in all the 38 community schools in the metropolis.In the first phase of its project, the sub metropolis’s office has constructed a modern lab in the schools that run science classes in grade 11 and 12. For secondary level students, the metropolis has established libraries with computers and WiFi facilities.Shivaraj Subedi, mayor of the sub metropolis, said that his office has taken this step to strengthen teaching-learning experience for students through practical education. “The sub metropolis aims to reform the education sector. That’s why we have prioritised building libraries and upgrade science labs in community schools,” he said.In the last fiscal year, the sub metropolis had allocated around Rs 2 million for the construction of science labs in community schools. The labs were constructed at Nabin Audhoygik Kadar Bahadur Reeta Secondary School in Devinagar, Kanti Secondary School in Haatbazaar Line and Siddheshwor Lal Kumari Secondary School in Deepnagar.Amisha Sen Oli, a zoology student at grade 11, said that it’s easy for her to understand lessons with the help of the modern lab in her school. She said, “We study our coursebook in class and understand the subject matter in the lab. This has helped us to understand our lessons better.”Last year, the sub metropolis had allocated around Rs 4.8 million to establish the libraries. Govinda Gyawali, the headmaster of Kanti Secondary School, said that students have shown interest in studies after the establishment of a library. Modern libraries were established at Amar, Ujir Singh, Gyanodaya and Jiteshwori Secondary Schools. Each of those schools had received Rs 650,000 each to construct a modern library last year. This year, the sub metropolis plans to establish five more libraries in different schools. Mitramani Khanal, chief at Education Division of the sub metropolis, said that the libraries have been set up in community schools to encourage students to pass their leisure time through learning. He said, “Each of the libraries consists of books and computer facilities. This has provided an additional platform for students to learn.”","Published at : November 19, 2019",Butwal,Amrita Anmol
Women go abroad for work and return duped and abused,"Last week, Geeta Pariyar of Tilottama Municipality in Rupandehi returned home after two years of foreign employment in Dubai—empty-handed and with stories of abuse.“I had to endure unspeakable miseries. I did not even have the money to buy my airfare home; my friends bought it for me,” Pariyar said in an interview with the Post. She had gone to Dubai to work as a domestic helper. An agent named Jog Narayan Chaudhary had offered to get her to Dubai, all for Rs60,000. For Pariyar, it sounded like a good deal. By way of illegal channels, Pariyar reached Dubai 15 days after she left home.In Dubai, Pariyar was tasked with taking care of four children at a house, for which she’d get Rs30,000, exclusive of food and lodging. Six months later, Pariyar sent home Rs100,000. However, her life took a detour when one day, when trying to heat food for the children, she accidentally damaged the micro-oven. “My life took a turn for the worst that day,” she recalled. “They beat me hard, and I had to make do without any food for three days. I was banned from getting out, and my phone and documents were confiscated.” When Pariyar went out of contact, her friends who had accompanied her during the trip informed the Nepali Embassy. But since the embassy couldn’t find any legal document on her, her friends had to rescue. They collected the ticket amount so that she could get back home.In Rupandehi, many women from impoverished backgrounds continue to fly abroad for employment using illicit measures. They are offered a trip by suave agents for a significantly low amount but aren’t given any training on the work they’re going to do; neither do they get the promised salary.When Maya Aryal from Semalar was offered a foreign employment gig in Kuwait, she was promised a monthly income of Rs35,000. Aryal, a single mother of two, asked her maternal family to take care of the children before flying abroad. In Kuwait, she was tasked with cooking for a family of ten and cleaning the home. But like Pariyar, Aryal was ill-equipped for the job. “They’d burn my hands with iron and torture me,” Aryal recalled. “I would get only Rs12,000 for salary but never on time.”There are no data on the number of women who go abroad for employment, but the trend is on the rise, said Janaki Aryal Ghimire, the chair of the association of women emigrants—Aaprabasi Mahila Samuha. The association, which was formed six years ago, has a membership of 800 foreign employment returnees like Pariyar and Aryal.“The association was formed to mitigate the rising trend of illicit foreign employment gigs,” said Ghimire. “We often meet and share our troubles.” The association has branched out to ten out of 16 local units in the district. “Most of the women travelling abroad for employment are illiterate and from impoverished backgrounds, so we need to visit their homes and make them aware of possible swindling,” she said. “But many women are still hesitant to share what they went through fearing social backlash.”","Published at : November 17, 2019",Butwal,Amrita Anmol
46 impoverished families to get homes in Rukum (East),"Forty-six impoverished families living in three local units in Rukum (East) can now hope to own their homes, as the provincial government has decided to provide them houses under the People’s Housing Programme (PHP).Under the programme, the provincial government has pledged to provide Rs 333,000 each to the 46 recipient families to construct a two-room house in the current fiscal year.The programme is coordinated by a committee led by Tej Bahadur Oli, a provincial lawmaker. The committee’s other members include the Chief District Officer, the District Coordination Officer and Chief Administrative Officers of the three local units. The houses are being constructed at Sisne Rural Municipality Ward No. 4 and 8, Bhume Rural Municipality Ward No. 1, 2 and 9 and Puthauttarganga Rural Municipality Ward No. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 8.According to the committee, the respective rural municipality office will decide which family will receive the sum under the programme. Tej Bahadur Oli, a provincial lawmaker and the coordinator of the committee, said that the provincial government has allocated Rs 15.3 million for the programme in the current fiscal year. He said, “Impoverished people living in the 10 wards of the three local units will have to fill up a form for the selection process. Then the rural municipality office will select the recipients.”In the last fiscal year, the provincial government had started construction of five houses for impoverished families in Kol, Puthauttarganga. Govardhan Budha Magar, deputy chief at Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the houses have been constructed for the families of Man Bahadur Damai, Dhanpura Sunar, Tiramala Kami, Ram Prasad Kami, and Tilpuri Damai. He said, “The construction work is yet to be completed. The project got delayed due to budget shortage.”The government has launched the campaign provide housing facilities to poor and marginalised people nationwide.","Published at : November 17, 2019",Rukum (east),Hari Gautam
Students in Rukum (East) put their fishing skills to good use,"Nanda Ram Sunar, 15, goes fishing every day after school. Sunar says he has been making a trip to the nearby Saniberi river for the past couple of years—every day for nine months in a year, barring the three months when the water level in the river plummets.Sunar, who lives in Jamabagar, spends two hours every evening fishing and heads home carrying his catch. Along the way, he sells the fish in Sisne bazaar. “This is how we make our living,” said Sunar. “I earn enough money to pay my school fees and also support my family.”Sunar is not alone in the school following this practice. For many boys from villages as far as Rangsi, Jamabagar, Tribeni, Deukhola, Pwang, Pokhara and Syalapakha, fishing in the evening is a ritual. Some of them are as young as 10.“I also share my income with my parents,” said Shailendra Khadka, an eighth-grader from Sisne, who says he has been fishing in the river “for a long time.”Locals confirmed to the Post that besides paying their tuition fees some of the boys have been supplementing their families’ income with the money they make by selling fish.“Boys pay their education expenses and also support their families,” said Kaman Singh Khatri, a teacher at Saujanya Basic School in Sisne. “They are taking advantage of the river that flows near their settlement.”Although seniors and elderly citizens often suggest boys not to enter the river, the boys don’t heed their advice. Jeevan KC, chairman of Sisne Rural Municipality Ward No. 2, said that they had warned the boys against entering the high-current river. “They have to risk their lives while fishing in the river,” KC said. “But they don’t listen to us. They say they have to go fishing to support their family.”","Published at : November 17, 2019",Rukum (east),Hari Gautam
"In Rajapur, police consistently fail to investigate cases involving marginalised communities","Fourteen-year-old Trishila Tharu’s body was discovered on November 7 at the home of Chitis Tharu in Bardiya’s Rajapur municipality. She was hanging by the neck. Trishila’s family, however, did not believe that she had hanged herself. Trishila had been missing for two days, after running away with Chitis on November 5. The family had attempted to coax her to come back and she had told them that she would return home in the evening as it was the last day to submit her application for the ninth grade exams, said Trishala’s father Rajendra Tharu.It is these circumstances that led the family to suspect foul play.“The death seemed suspicious as we were informed very late, and when we reached the house, the body was already on the floor,” Narendra Tharu, Trishila’s father, told the Post over the phone from Rajapur. “We tried to file an FIR [first information report] against Chitis and his family, but the police did not accept our complaint, despite speaking to them for hours.”Trishila’s case is only the latest in a string of incidents where the Rajapur police office has failed to register FIRs and investigate cases involving marginalised communities like Tharus and Dalits. Even though an FIR is simply a request for an investigation, the police, in at least three cases, have refused to seriously pursue suspicious cases of suicide involving minors and members of marginalised communities.According to the Rajapur Area Police Office, Trishila had run away with Chitis, whom she had known for the last six months, and had committed suicide because her father had scolded her on the phone.“These kinds of incidents are common in the village. Many girls run away with their lovers and later commit suicide if something goes wrong,” said Inspector Mitra Mani Acharya of the Rajapur Police Station.Acharya said that the police had refused the family an FIR as their claims were baseless and they didn’t want to arrest an innocent person. They even handed over Trishila’s body to Chitis’ family, on the grounds that the two were married, even though both were minors. However, after Trishila’s story appeared in the media, the Rajapur police was forced, on November 10, to register the FIR.“The accused is in custody now and we are investigating the case,” said Deputy Superintendent Biswaraj Khadka, chief of the Rajapur Police Station. “All the evidence collected so far and the autopsy report show that it’s a suicide case.” However, the case of Pramila Tharu, another 14-year-old from the same area, opens room for doubt. Pramila too died under similar circumstances in October last year. She was found hanging in the forest and the Rajapur police summarily ruled her death a suicide. However, an investigation by The Record found numerous inconsistencies in her death and pointed to a structural failure on the part of the police to treat Pramila’s case with the seriousness it deserved.Similarly, in June last year, the body of 24-year-old Dipak BK was discovered along the Nepal-India border. On May 21, 2018, BK, an auto driver, had gone to the Indian border with Roshan Sharma and Hari Timalsina. According to Rachana Luhar, BK’s mother, BK had told her that he would be back in a few hours, but he never returned.“A day later, local police came to inform me that a body had been found and that it was my son,” Luhar told the Post. “It was my son Dipak. Police told me that he died of an overdose.”Luhar, however, was unconvinced. After seven days, she decided to file an FIR against the two friends who had accompanied BK to the border. “But no one was ready to write my FIR,” she said. “Police did not accept my FIR for the first four days but after my lawyer met with human rights officers and mediapersons, they finally accepted my FIR.”Again, it was only after outside pressure that the police took both accused into custody and began their investigations.However, police officials say that they are not negligent when it comes to investigating any cases. “When reaching the incident site, what happened can be clearly seen,” said Inspector Acharya. “In the Trishila case, the victim’s family tried to file FIR saying their daughter was kidnapped, raped and murdered but it seemed that they both ran away together.”The Rajapur police also stressed that they do not refuse any FIRs if the case is genuine.“It’s not that we do not take FIRs, but the case should look genuine,” said Deputy Superintendent Khadka. “We do not have any intention to save criminals and we are investigating these cases impartially.” Despite the police’s assurances, research shows that the police tend to treat Tarai communities differently. Madhesis and Tharus are more likely to suffer torture and misbehaviour in police custody, according to a report by the Advocacy Forum, a human rights organisation. Dalits are also likely to suffer more at the hands of the police than ‘upper-caste’ Brahmins, said the report, which was based on a study carried out in prisons in Kathmandu, Banke, Rupandehi, Kaski, Kanchanpur and Morang districts.“People from marginalised communities, poor backgrounds and women tend to face such situations, where negligence can be seen all the way from providing service to investigating cases,” said Mohan Karna, a human rights lawyer and executive director of the Terai Human Rights Defenders Alliance. “This is not just a problem with the police. Even other government offices mistreat marginalised communities. This kind of behaviour could result in a loss of public trust in the police.”","Published at : November 15, 2019",Kathmandu,Shuvam Dhungana
Sainamaina Municipality in Rupandehi starts patrolling forests to control illegal activities,"Sainamaina Municipality in Rupandehi district has stepped up a joint patrolling initiative in many areas of its forests to control rampant smuggling of forest products and wildlife parts.Because of illegal logging and rampant poaching activities, the municipality has coordinated with Area Police Office, Division Forest Office and Community Forest Users Group to conduct patrolling starting last Sunday. The armed security personnel and forest guards have been on patrol in the forest areas for the last two days.Chitra Bahadur Karki, mayor of the municipality, said that with the move they aim to control smuggling of forest products and wildlife parts. He said, “We have incorporated security personnel, forest officials and forest users group to conduct patrolling in the forest areas. We hope that illegal activities—including forest fires—can be controlled now.”The municipality covers around 1,200 hectares of forestland which expands from the Chure hills to the Tarai. Sixteen community forests and one collaborative forest of the municipality have been registered in the Division Forest Office in Rupandehi. To implement this move, the municipality has endorsed the Community Forest Operation and Management Act 2075, which allows them to deploy security personnel to patrol the forests. “As the settlements are scattered and few, locals will not be able to carry out preservation efforts. That’s why we formed patrol groups to conduct patrolling to control unlawful activities in the forests,” said Keshav Aryal, the information office of the municipality. Police personnel from Area Police Offices in Saaljhandi and Ranyaura are taking the lead in patrolling the forests. There are 42 members in the patrol group. Indra Bahadur Pacchai, chief at the Division Forest Office, said that security personnel and forest guards are patrolling the forests by dividing the area into three different sections. “Timber smuggling, poaching and forest fires are the major challenges here,” said Pacchai. “With the patrolling in place, we hope to reduce such acts.”To control illegal activities, the municipality has also imposed a ban on locals entering the forests without taking permission from the municipality. “The municipality office will take action against those who enter the forest without taking permission,” said Karki, adding that they have separated grazing land and some forest area for locals to collect fodder from and graze their cattle in.Lal Bahadur Kalamagar, a local of Sainamaina, said that most of the locals have welcomed the municipality’s move. “The joint patrolling will help control illegal logging, smuggling and forest fires. Even if we have to wait for firewood collection, it’s a small inconvenience and we are okay with it since the move stands to conserve wild animals and forest products.”","Published at : November 14, 2019",Butwal,Amrita Anmol
Babai bridge damaged due to careless construction nearby,"A bridge over Babai river in Gulariya-Nepalgunj road section along the Postal Highway has been damaged, cutting off Gulariya, the district headquarters, from the rest of the Bardiya district.The 35-year-old single-lane bridge is the only bridge linking Gulariya to other places in the district. The bridge was damaged because of the on-going construction of a new bridge alongside it, said Ram Surat Raya, a local of Bhada. “The old bridge is on the verge of complete collapse due to soil erosion caused by the ongoing construction work for a new bridge.” The new bridge is designed to have six pillars for which the area was widened with the help of excavators. Raya believes that the use of the excavators have weakened the old bridge’s foundation, and this risk was not taken into consideration by the local administration. He said, “Every day, hundreds of vehicles including heavy good carriers pass through the bridge. The foundation of the old bridge was weak and the heavy work done around the area has added to the burden.”According to the Bridge Division Area Number 3 in Nepalgunj, the authority concerned should put a complete ban on the operation of heavy vehicles over the bridge and its surrounding areas until the contractor completes the construction work of the new bridge. Dhurba Bahadur Chand, an engineer at the Bridge Division, said that they have already informed the local administration and the Division Road Office about the weak condition of the bridge. He said, “Heavy vehicles should be banned from plying the bridge area for 15 days. And the old bridge should be repaired within that period to prevent collapse.”A team of the officials of the District Administration Office and technician of Gulariya Municipality has already inspected the bridge. Gopal Chaudhary, the technician of the municipality, said that the contractor company did not adopt safety measures while undertaking the construction of the new bridge. He said, “The foundation of the old bridge is cracked and the use of excavators to lay the foundation of the new bridge has only weakened it further.”According to the Bridge Division Area Number 3 in Nepalgunj, Lama Swachhanda JV in Pulchowk, Lalitpur, has been constructing the new bridge at a cost of Rs 334.95 million. As per the agreement, the construction of the new bridge should be completed within December 2020.Niraj Sharma, ward chairman of Gulariya Ward No. 6, said that the contractor company should immediately take protective measures, such as refilling the dug out area with soil to protect the old bridge from complete collapse. “Otherwise, vehicular movement along the road section will be obstructed cutting Gulariya resident from the rest of the district,” said Sharma.The Post tried to contact the representatives of the contractor company but they were not reachable for comment.","Published at : November 13, 2019",Bardiya,Kamal Panthi
"Most public school teachers enroll their wards in private schools, a survey shows","A survey conducted by Tulsipur Sub-metropolis shows that 91 percent of public school teachers have enrolled their children in private schools. The survey was conducted among 9150 students of 70 public schools and 18916 students of 69 private schools in the sub-metropolis.Commentators say the statistics show the public school teachers’ loss of faith in their own profession.“The data shows the disproportionate distribution of students among public and private schools and the deteriorating faith of people in public schools,” said Shishir Khanal, chair of Teach for Nepal. “About 50 percent of children from peasant communities are enrolled in public schools, which makes one think if public schools are for the children of farmers only.” Moreover, the teaching process and its quality in public schools pale in comparison with its private counterpart, with students of public schools performing most poorly in Mathematics and English. In public schools, the teaching outcome in English is measured at 0.72 percent, in contrast to 7.64 of private schools. Meanwhile, in Maths, the data is 0.61 percent in public schools and 5.46 in private schools.The only thing where public schools outclass private ones is when it comes to abuse for performing poorly. According to the survey, 53 percent of students in public schools and 68 percent in private schools are abused for performing poorly. Further, the survey shows that 33 percent of students in private schools take tuition classes outside of regular lessons, compared to 10 percent in public schools. Only 33 percent of the students who participated in the survey said they read books outside of the designated curriculum.The survey was conducted by 120 volunteers who visited the schools. The volunteers asked a set of questions via mobile applications.“We found a great desire to study among the students, but what is lacking is a favourable environment,” said Ankur Uprety, one of the volunteers involved in the survey.Mayor of Tulsipur Sub-metropolis Ghanashyam Pandey said his office will move ahead, keeping in mind the suggestions and cues from the survey. “The survey has shown the real face of our education standards,” Pandey said. “There is a lot to improve. We will increase the budget allocated for education and put result-oriented efforts.”Photo caption: Students in Ambikeshwari Public School in Tulsipur-12.","Published at : November 11, 2019",Dang,Durga Lal KC
Lack of functional toilets in Mayadevi temple area compels Lumbini visitors to relieve themselves in the open,"Tourists visiting the Mayadevi temple area in Lumbini complain of a lack of proper toilets in the area.Edward Tenny, an American tourist, was recently in Lumbini and on a visit to Mayadevi temple. “I needed to use the restroom desperately but there was not a single one to be found anywhere,” said Tenny. “I took a rickshaw back to my hotel to use the bathroom and when I came back I had to pay the Rs 500 entry fee again.”With the lack of functional toilets, many tourists are compelled to relieve themselves out in the open, said a security guard. A month ago, the country was declared open defecation free.“The ongoing Lumbini Visit Year 2076 aims to receive 2 million visitors, but if the officials can’t take care of toilets, then I don’t know how the target will be achieved,” said Birendra Mishra, a local. “Toilets might be a small issue but an important one.”Stately monuments abound but there’s not a single toilet that is accessible and usable in the vicinity, making it impossible for visitors like Tenny to enjoy their visit.The Lumbini Masterplan, which aims to renovate the Buddha’s birth town across a three square mile area, has built four well-equipped toilets. Due to lack of maintenance and their inconvenient location, three of the four are rendered unusable.“From the outside, these toilets look nice and well-equipped like those at foreign airports,” said Lilamani Sharma, secretary of the Lumbini Hotel Association. “But nobody uses them. The toilets are in a state of disrepair and need renovation.”Rajan Basnet, information officer at the Lumbini Development Trust, said that even though the facilities were built, there is the lack of a proper plan on how to operate them. “The Trust cannot operate the toilets employing people,” Basnet said, adding that the trust is soon coming up with a plan to settle the issue.The Trust had launched e-toilets in 2018 but they are currently out of operation. According to data by the Lumbini Development Trust, a total of 101,269 foreign tourists have visited Lumbini in the first eight months of 2019. The figure is 7,461 more compared to the same period last year.Mirroring the condition of toilets in the tourist hub, the state of road leading to Lumbini is also in disrepair which stakeholders say has been hindering the growth in tourist numbers.","Published at : November 10, 2019",Lumbini,Manoj Poudel
Geophysics survey of Ramgram Stupa begins,"Archaeologists started conducting geophysics survey to find out ancient structures at Ramgram Stupa in Ramgram Municipality, Nawalparasi (West), on Friday.The stupa houses the astadhatu (relics) of Lord Gautam Buddha. Out of eight such remains of the Buddha, this is the only complete astadhatu.The survey was initiated by a team of experts and archaeologists from the Durham University of the UK, the Department of Archeology and the Lumbini Development Trust. Ram Bahadur Kunwar, a senior archaeologist, said the team will carry out survey works for 10 to 12 days. “The survey aims to discover ancient structures below the ground,” said Kunwar. According to him, excavation works along the area will be carried out based on this survey.Three years ago, the remnants of an ancient pond were found some distance from the north-west corner of the stupa during a survey. Government authorities are working to include Ramgram Stupa on the list of Unesco World Heritage Sites. Professor Robin Coningham of Durham University said that it will be easy to trace ancient structures, including the pond, vihara and roads of the Budhha era, after conducting a geophysics survey in the area. “It will be helpful to collect archaeological evidence from the Ramgram Stupa area,” he said.In the past, survey works were carried out in the Ramgram Stupa area in 1997, 1999 and 2018. Locals hope that the area will be preserved and developed after the survey results come out.","Published at : November 10, 2019",Parasi,Nabin Paudel
14-year-old girl found dead in suspicious circumstances,"Relatives of 14-year-old Trishila Chaudhary, who was found dead under suspicious circumstances in Rajapur-6 on Thursday, have demanded an investigation be led into the case. They claimed the victim was abducted, raped and subsequently murdered.The victim’s family members vented their ire as the police refused to register a rape and murder case against a local boy. Trishila’s uncle Narendra believes that a 15-year-old boy took her to his house three days before she was found dead. “The incident is suspicious; it should be investigated in an independent way,” he demanded. According to Narendra, both the victim and the accused are classmates of a local community school. Postmortem of Chaudhary was conducted on Friday. But the postmortem and viscera reports are yet to come, said police. The bereaved family have refused to receive the body stating that the police are reluctant to investigate the case. They claim that the police’s efforts are on to dismiss the case, stating it as a suicide.Mitra Bahadur Acharya, inspector at the Area Police Office in Rajapur, said the accused was called at the police office for interrogation. “We will register the case after the postmortem and viscera reports,” he added.","Published at : November 10, 2019",Bardiya,Kamal Panthi

Road expansion work along Butwal-Narayangadh begins,"Road expansion work along Butwal-Narayangadh of the East-West Highway section has finally kicked off, around seven months after Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli laid the foundation stone for the project.The Butwal-Narayangadh Road Upgradation Project has been on hold because the number of trees to be cut down along the road stretch was fivefold more than what was mentioned in the project’s Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) report. “The issue of felling trees is yet to be settled. So, we have started expanding parts of the road that has no trees,” said Sujan Adhikari, chief of the road project. The road project has divided the 114-km road into two sections, Daunne-Gaidakot and Daunne-Butwal. Expansion work along the Daunne-Gaidakot started from November 6. For the first phase, workers will be constructing a new culvert by demolishing the old one. “We are currently working along the Kawasoti-Kharkatta section,” said Adhikari, adding that works related to constructing a bridge in Rajahar are also underway.The government had conducted the EIA in 2016 that stated that 9,027 trees had to be cut down on both sides of the road stretch for the expansion work. But the number of trees that need to be felled down has now reached 50,352. A fresh assessment was conducted before the project’s launch.The project said it had sent the file to the Ministry of Forest and Environment seeking the permission of felling trees as required. However, the ministry is yet to take a decision regarding fell down trees at Thumsi, Kawasoti, Chormara, Arunkhola, Daunne, Sunwal, among other areas.“We are coordinating with the forest ministry about the matter. The road expansion work will gather momentum as soon as the ministry resolves the issue,” said Adhikari.Besides the issue of felling trees, electricity poles installed along the road stretch also pose difficulties for the road expansion work. Transmission lines of 132kV, 33kV and 11kV run along the road section.For the road expansion work along the Butwal-Narayangadh stretch, the government has allocated Rs16.99 billion, of which 85 percent will be covered by loan assistance from the Asian Development Bank. The Department of Roads had signed an agreement with China State Construction Engineering Corporation in February 2019 to implement the project. As per the plan, the existing two-lane road will be upgraded to six lanes within the next four years.Under the road expansion project, two parallel bridges will also be constructed on the stretch. The road project should also construct at least 15 underpasses or overpasses for the movement of wildlife along the Daunne-Gaidakot section.","Published at : November 7, 2019",Nawalparasi,Narayan Sharma
Political parties block community school merger and teacher adjustment plan in Rolpa,"Several local bodies in Rolpa district have prepared a framework for the merger of community schools and the adjustment of teachers. However, people’s representatives haven’t yet implemented the policy due to the pressure of political lobbying, says the education unit in the district.The education unit of Rolpa Municipality collected necessary data, prepared a policy regarding the school merger and adjustment of teachers, and put forward the proposal to the elected representatives for implementation. But nothing has come off the proposal yet.“All the necessary preparations have been made. But the elected representatives and higher-level leaders of various parties are yet to reach a consensus on the issue. As a result, our plan to merge community schools with fewer student numbers and adjust teachers’ posts is in limbo,” said Mahendra Parajuli, chief of the education unit. He said it is challenging to work towards enhancing the quality of education in community schools in the present scenario. “There is an acute shortage of teachers in several community schools of Liwang, the district headquarters of Rolpa. But the plan to merge these schools has been on hold,” said Parajuli. One hundred sixty-eight teachers are serving 66 community schools—nine secondary, 14 basic and 43 primary—in Rolpa Municipality. Out of these teachers, only 102 are on the government payroll; the rest have been hired by the schools themselves on a contract basis. Since the government has hired fewer teachers than required in community schools, the quality of education in these schools has been compromised. “The elected representatives understand the need for school mergers and teachers’ adjustment, but they are reluctant to move ahead with the process. They are worried about their vote banks. Their party leaders and activists do not want to merge schools. Or if the schools are to be merged and teachers adjusted, they should be done as per their interest,” said a source working in the education sector in the district.Purna KC, the municipality mayor, however, claimed that the local body has been preparing a policy to uplift the quality of education in its community schools. “We will hold a discussion with stakeholders to formulate education policies and implement them soon,” he added.Tribeni Rural Municipality in the district faces a similar ordeal. The local body had put forth the proposal of school merger and teacher adjustment, but the proposal was not endorsed due to a dispute among the representatives and party leaders.“There are some challenges, but we are making efforts to implement the plans by holding talks with locals,” said Shanta Kumar Oli, chairman of the rural municipality. Oli opines that the authority of school mergers and post adjustments should be granted to the education ministry rather than to the local units. “There is always political party interference when we try to move forward with the plans.” There are 10 local units, including a municipality, in Rolpa.","Published at : November 6, 2019",Rolpa,Kashiram Dangi
Butwal’s women leaders burdened with gender-based discrimination in governance,"Women leaders in Butwal say gender-based discrimination is rife in politics. Women representing various parties across the political spectrum echoed the sentiment during a women-centric conference—Aguwa Mahila Bhela (or Conference of Leading Women)—that took place in Butwal on Saturday.One of the speakers at the conference, Radha Kumari Gyawali, who is a lawmaker and the central committee member of the Nepal Communist Party, said women are discriminated against by the proponents of patriarchy. “Many male leaders find it hard to accept us as leaders and refuse to provide us with leadership opportunities,” Gyawali said. “This has created a severe impact on individuals, family, society, party and the state.”Stressing on the need to condemn gender-based discrimination in politics, she said, “We shouldn’t accept any kind of discrimination. Rather, we need to protest and discuss,” she said. “If we exert pressure from the ground level, then we can change things.” Likewise, Than Kumari Thapa, a member of a provincial parliament, said women are still treated as “second class” citizens within the party ranks. “We are not given any opportunity to show our abilities,” Thapa said.Meanwhile, Deepa BK, a member of the Social Committee at the Provincial Parliament, said the lack of participation from women in decision making and budget allocation in the local levels has hindered development. “Even though women lawmakers raise issues of equal participation in development projects, our voices are often ignored,” BK said.","Published at : November 4, 2019",Butwal,Amrita Anmol
Four major motorable bridges in Dang completed before set deadline,"At a time when construction delay of almost all the development projects has been reported across the country, four motorable bridges have been completed before the deadline in Dang district. The construction company claimed it completed the construction of the bridge eight months ahead of the deadline. “The construction of the bridge has been already completed. Just the wall on pavements of the bridge remains to be built. We plan to hand over the bridge to the authorities within three months,” said Sudip Basyal, an engineer at the construction company. The deadline for the completion of the construction work was July 2020. The bridges are between 200 metres and 860 metres long and the construction has been completed seven months to one year ahead of the deadline mentioned in the project agreement. These development works are exemplary for the construction companies who leave even small development works incomplete for years.The then prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal had laid the foundation stone of Rapti bridge linking Sisahaniya and Mahadewa of Dang on December 7, 2016. Anak Construction Pvt Ltd was awarded the contract to build the 860-metre bridge, which is believed to be the second-longest motorable bridge in the country. The total cost of the bridge construction is Rs 1 billion. Anak Construction is the same builder that built Kothiyaghat bridge across the Karnali river in Bardiya district a few years ago. The Kothiyaghat is the longest bridge in the country measuring 1,015 metres. Basyal said that the company had also completed the construction of the longest bridge around one year earlier than the set deadline. “The dedication of the construction company, availability of required equipment, management of human resources and assistance of the local people contributed to the timely completion of the bridges. Delays in development projects are rare when the construction company and stakeholders are accountable for it,” he said. Similarly, a 200-metre bridge linking Kapadadebi and Manpur across the Gwar stream has been completed before the deadline. Transportation of goods and services has already started along the newly constructed bridge. Rasuwa Construction had received the contract of the bridge. The same construction company had completed another bridge linking Bhojpur of Tulsipur and Tarigaun two years ago. The Bhojpur-Tariguan bridge was handed over to the authorities a year ahead of the July 2018 deadline.Another under-construction bridge along the Ghorahi-Tulsipur road section, handled by Rasuwa Construction, is also almost complete. The construction company is preparing to hand over the bridge within two months.“Development projects can be completed on time if the company gives due priority and carries out the work sincerely,” said Rameshwor Rijal, manager of Rasuwa Construction.These are only a few successful development projects in the district in terms of timely work completion. “Around 99 percent development projects are not completed within the set deadline. Most of the development projects have been delayed in the district except some small road construction works,” said Lila Bahadur Bhandari, the acting chief at Division Road Office in Ghorahi.","Published at : November 4, 2019","Dang,",Durgalal KC
Three persons found murdered in Gulmi forest,"Three persons, a woman and two children, were found brutally killed in a forest at Harrachaur of Gulmi district.Locals of the area discovered the bodies—which had already started to decay—in Chaurali Pokhara forest on Saturday and immediately informed the police. The heads of the victims were severely bashed.Investigating officers suspected that the victims were from the same family and were murdered. The bodies are yet to be identified.According to Rajendra Singh Khadka, the superintendent of police in Gulmi, the woman is likely to be in her early 30s, while the boy and the girl could be 10 and 7 years respectively.Khadka said the bodies were found around eight metres from the Shantipur-Sukhaura road. The security personnel recovered a hammer, a mineral water bottle and some blood-stained stones near the incident site.The incident site lies near the border of Gulmi and Baglung district, approximately 70 kilometres north-east from Tamghas, the district headquarters of Gulmi.A police team led by Inspector Raj Kumar Rawal reached the incident site and initiated an investigation into the gruesome murder. “It might have been a murder. The victims sustained severe injuries in head,” said Rawal, adding that police team started the investigation from different angles.The nearest settlement from the murder site is Gaidhunga, a settlement of eight Gurung households. The preliminary police investigation shows that the victims were not from that very settlement. “The victims might have been taken to the murder spot from another place and murdered,” he added. “The murder took place about a week ago.”","Published at : November 3, 2019",Rupandehi,Ghanshyam Gautam

The locals of Syaulibang have to walk up to six hours to reach the administrative centre of the rural municipality. “Life is not easy for us here,” said Budha.The authorities initiated construction of the road stretch from the fiscal year 1998/99. Over the years, the District Development Committee, Division Road Office, District Coordination Committee and the Infrastructure Development Office have carried out the road projects, at different times. A huge amount of budget under the Local Infrastructure Development Partnership Programme has been spent on the road project so far.Lack of enough budget, misappropriation of funds, ineffective use of the allocated budget, disputes regarding road alignment are the main causes behind the delay of the road project, said Sher Bahadur Sen, ward chairman of Naubahini Ward No. 1. “The villagers of Syaulibang have had to bear the brunt of the failure of the concerned authorities,” said Sen. According to him, Rs 5 million was allocated for the road project by the Infrastructure Development Office in Pyuthan in the fiscal year 2018/19. But only Rs 700,000 was spent on the road, he said.“The locals suffer due to the lack of road. Travelling to and from the village becomes more difficult when the weather turns bad. The budget allocated to construct the road is frozen every year,” said Sen, expressing his anger on the government authorities’ failure to take action against the various contractors who have been at the helm of the construction project over the years. Mahat-Mamata JV and Paudel Construction have been awarded the contract of the road project for the past two years. For this fiscal year, the Infrastructure Development Office allocated Rs 6.9 million budget to the project. However, four months into the year and work on the road is yet to start. “Various political leaders, ministers and lawmakers who visit the village during their election campaigns have made assurances on the completion of the road project but none of them has kept their word,” said Budha. The under-construction road is 27 kilometres long and is supposed to link Syaulibang to Khalanga.","Published at : November 2, 2019",Pyuthan,Giru Prasad Bhandari
Nepalgunj prison inmates complain of misconduct,"Inmates of Nepalgunj Prison in Banke district resorted to a brief protest against irregularities and mismanagement in the prison on Thursday. They padlocked the prison gate (from inside) and kept Bharat Fadera (a Chaukidar) and Man Bahadur Shahi (a Naike) from entering the prison.The inmates complained of mistreatment at the hands of the jailer, Chaukidar (a guard) and Naike (a leade) of the prison. Bikash KC, an inmate, said that the jail administration is extremely mismanaged. “There are so many irregularities inside the prison. For instance, we have to pay Rs 100 for a kg of radish whereas radish cost only Rs 60 per kg outside the prison gates. We are also subjected to physical and mental torture inside the prison.” The inmates have also submitted a demand note to the local administration which states that the jailer took a bribe from Fadera to appoint him as a guard. The position of a Chaukidar is a coveted one among all inmates. A former inmate is selected and appointed as one and he overlooks the day-to-day management inside the prison. The appointment is done on the basis of his/her good behaviour while serving his/her jail sentence. The individual then acts as a leader for the term-serving inmates inside the prison. On Friday, the protest was withdrawn after the local administration reached an agreement to form an investigation committee to find out the internal problem of the prison. “We have transferred the jailer and suspended the guard and the leader as well,” said Kumar Bahadur Khadka, Chief District Officer of Banke. Bhagat Singh, one of the inmates, blamed the guard and the leader of the jail of extortion. “The guard and the leader of the jail extort money from us. This jail has turned into a money minting enterprise for them. We cannot tolerate this mismanagement,” he said. However, Bharatraj Pandey, the jailer, has denied all allegations. “The prison is flooded with inmates beyond capacity. Because of this, we are unable to control the inmates. Those nearing the end of their sentence want to be appointed as guards and that is when tensions inside the prison rise,” said Pandey. Bir Bahadur Oli, superintendent of police in Banke, said that the prison has run out of space due to a drastic increase in the number of inmates. The prison designed to hold approximately 300 inmates currently holds over 772 inmates. “This has threatened security in the prison,” said Oli.Bikash Acharya, a legal practitioner, however, agrees with the inmates and points at the weak management of jail administration. “The inmates are put through hardships inside the prison. The torment they face goes against human rights,” said Acharya, adding the concerned authority should immediately find alternatives to solve the problem. Rupa Gahatraj contributed reporting.","Published at : November 2, 2019",Nepalgunj,Madhu Shahi
Medical college students launch strike demanding “extra fees” be returned in Bhairahawa,"Students from the Universal College of Medical Sciences in Bhairahawa have launched a protest against the college administration alleging it has failed to address their demands, which includes the return of additional tuition fee, and is one among six other demands.The college administration, however, has said that the students denied to forward their demands “methodically” and alleged the students of inviting pupils from other colleges for protest.“The college administration seemed indifferent when we were planning to put forward our demands methodically,” said one of the agitating students, who chose to remain anonymous. “Instead, the students who were returning after submitting a written complaint to the district’s Chief District Officer were locked out of the college and forced to remain out for the night.”With the final exams starting coming Wednesday, agitating students have said they will boycott the exams and all other academic programmes of the Tribhuvan University, with which the college is affiliated. The students have staged sit-ins in front of the college’s main gate.The students allege that the college has been charging them a total of Rs300,000 more than what is declared by the government. Exam fees, too, have been raised by up to Rs10,000, the students say. The students demand the extra fees be scrapped.The college administration, however, has said the “adjustment” of extra fees is not just a problem of one college but of those across the country, and that it is ready to accept the criteria designated by the government and Tribhuvan University.Meanwhile, the college’s chief administration officer Ajay Kumar PS said the students have declined his invitation for a negotiation. “By no means will the college stop the oncoming exams, abided by the methodologies issued by TU,” he said.The agitating students said they are preparing to file the documents of extra fees to the district administration office.","Published at : November 2, 2019",Bhairahawa,Madhav Dhungana
A 10-point agreement signed between the agitating parties and local administration in Kapilvastu,"The representatives of protesting locals and the local administration reached a 10-point agreement on Thursday night. The situation in Krishnanagar in Kapilvastu remained peaceful throughout Friday, according to locals. Chief District Officer Gajendra Bahadur Shrestha said the curfew order can be lifted from Saturday if the situation remains calm. “Security personnel have been patrolling the violence-prone area and have allowed peaceful movement of people,” said Dharmabir Maurya, a local. The Thursday night talk was held in the presence of Province 5 assembly member Birendra Kanodiya and Krishnanagar Chamber of Commerce Chairman Ram Kumar Gupta.

Man dies after police fire on a group defying curfew in Krishnanagar,"A man died in Kapilvastu district’s Krishnanagar on Thursday when police opened fire on a group of protesters defying a curfew imposed by the local administration. According to the District Police Office, the deceased has been identified as 22-year-old Suraj Pandey.The local administration imposed an indefinite curfew at 11am on Thursday, a day after a dispute between members of the Hindu and Muslim communities turned violent. According to locals, the dispute arose when a group of Hindus were on their way to immerse idols of goddess Laxmi into the nearby river. Hindus in the Tarai tend to immerse idols of gods and goddesses after their worship. However, the Hindus changed the route they were taking and opted for one where the road passes through a Muslim girls' school, according to witnesses.When a Muslim man attempted to stop the group, a small confrontation arose which then turned ugly. As members of the Hindu community refused to budge, a stone was suddenly thrown and violence escalated, said the witnesses. Police fired around 50 tear gas shells to contain the situation. Four persons were injured in the clashes.After an overnight calm, on Thursday morning, people from both the communities began to gather in groups, complaining against “police excesses”. Locals armed with sharp weapons and sticks began to fill the roads and alleys, even burning down a police beat, according to the district police.Afraid that the situation could spiral out of control, the local administration announced an indefinite curfew.  Post Photo“Security personnel were forced to open fire after a group of people defied the curfew and turned violent,” said Deputy Superintendent Sunil Malla, spokesperson for the district police.The local administration has called for calm and an amicable solution to the dispute, urging local leaders to hold talks, according to Chief District Officer Gajendra Bahadur Shrestha.“Nobody has come into contact so far,” said Shrestha. “We’ve also requested the Federation of Nepali Journalists and civil society to help create a conducive environment for talks with both sides.”Security, meanwhile, has been stepped up in Krishnanagar and the surrounding areas. Large numbers of personnel from the Nepal Police and the Armed Police Force have been deployed, according to the local administration.There was tension in Krishnanagar also in October last year after a dispute over the route to take for immersing Durga idols.","Published at : October 31, 2019",Kapilvastu,Manoj Paudel
Local units in Rupandehi take initiatives to manage waste,"Many local units in Rupandehi district have made public their sustainable plan to manage garbage in the current fiscal year.Tilottama Municipality has allocated Rs10 million to establish a waste management centre in the current fiscal. Giriraj Dumre, chief at the Environment Section of the municipality, said the municipality has been dumping garbage at open spaces in Fireline, Dingarnagar, Harpur and Karhiya areas. “We will start constructing the centre after finding a suitable land plot,” said Dumre. Waste management is a major problem in Rupandehi district. Due to the absence of proper waste management plants, the majority of the local units have been dumping waste on river banks and open areas. To combat the garbage issue, Sainamaina Municipality has prepared a Detailed Project Report (DPR) to construct a permanent landfill site. Jograj Ghimire, chief at the Environment Section of the municipality, said the office will start the construction of a landfill site after the provincial cabinet’s decision. “The project was started with a fund of Rs 5 million. We plan to ask for an extra budget from the provincial government for the project,” said Ghimire. The municipality has been disposing waste materials at Sainamaina Ward No. 9, he added.Lumbini Sanskritik Municipality also plans to construct a landfill site at a government land in Ward No.11. Rakesh Kahar, an engineer of the municipality, said since the local unit produces a large amount of waste, it requires a landfill site that is big enough to accommodate the refuse. According to officials at Devdaha Municipality, the office has been planning to manage garbage by separating biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste. “Waste management working guidelines have already been passed. We are going to work in coordination with Tol Development Association and cooperatives,” said Hira Bahadur Khatri, chief at the municipality.For the time being, the municipality is coordinating with Buddha Community Forest to build a landfill site in the forest area. “We have allocated Rs 1 million to build a landfill site at the forest,” said Ramesh Giri, section officer at the Planning Section of the municipality.","Published at : October 25, 2019",Rupandehi,Sanju Paudel
Nepali clay modellers find it difficult to make a living,"Gobari Kewat of Banarhawa, Rupandehi, has been supporting his family of six as a clay modeller. For the past 15 years, he has been making and selling idols of Hindu gods and goddesses.He has a workshop, a rented room, at Bangai Chowk where he creates his works using mostly straw and clay. Most of his works he sells during major Hindu festivals like Dashain, Tihar, Chhath and Sripanchami.In recent years, however, he hasn’t been selling as many idols as he used to. He has been losing his clients to the idol-makers from India.  “People import idols from India since they don’t have to pay customs duty. That way the price is cheaper,” said Kewat.The idols Kewat make can cost anywhere from Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000. In the Indian market, they come much cheaper.Tihar is just around the corner but Kewat does not hope to do much business, with his Indian competitors poaching his potential clients. “It’s difficult to compete with the Indian idol makers,” said Kewat.His business is sinking and he cannot do anything about it. Kewat has seen many local idol makers like him fold their business unable to compete with Indian clay modellers. Until just a couple of years ago, many households near Nepal-India border in Rupandehi depended on idol-making as a means of living. Today, most of them have left the profession. Only a few idol makers remain in the district. “We make the idols but the customers buy theirs from the Indian town of Nautanwa,” said Surya Bahadur BK, another idol maker from Mayadevi Ward No. 7. “We simply cannot match the idol price of the Indian idol makers, since we have to get our materials, like rope, nails, colours and other decorative items from the Indian market.”Disregarding the price tag, BK says the idols made in Nepal can match those made in India in terms of build and quality.Idol makers like BK and Kewat have demanded the authorities concerned to create a level playing field for them to compete and keep their profession alive. Bhairahawa-Sunauli is one of the major border points between Nepal and India. Around 500 idols of Durga, a Hindu goddess, were imported from the border point for this year’s Dashain festival. “We don’t charge customs for single-purpose clay idols which are brought from India. Only stone and metal idols are liable to customs duty,” said Kamal Prasad Bhattarai, chief at the customs office. That may be the case but for sculptors like Kewat and BK, making a living is getting difficult. “If this continues, I might move away from this trade for good,” said BK.","Published at : October 25, 2019",Bhairahawa,Madhav Dhungana
Construction of solid waste processing centres in Rupandehi has been cancelled,"A plan to construct garbage disposal and management facilities in Rupandehi district has been put on hold due to continuous political disputes and locals’ obstruction.In 2010, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) had agreed to fund the construction of a solid waste processing centre in Butwal and a waste management plant in Siddharthanagar. The original plan was to complete the construction within five years of the start of the project, but the deadline was later extended to December 2018. Nearly 10 months have passed since the deadline, and there is still no sign of the facilities. The projects have been marred by false starts, delays and protests, much to the frustration of the ADB. “The plan was to invest Rs 370 million in Butwal and Rs 350 million in Siddharthanagar for the waste management facilities. But now the ADB is not interested because of the delays and disputes witnessed by the projects,” said Shikhar Tamang, manager of ADB in Butwal.Butwal Sub-metropolitan City generates 53 tonnes of waste daily, and it has no proper site to dispose of them. The plan to build a waste management facility inside Shivanagar Community Forest has been blocked by the locals of Charange in Devdaha Municipality. The residents of Charange have opposed the plan, saying that they don’t want a waste management facility close to their homes. In the absence of a waste management plant, the city authority has been dumping waste on the river banks and open areas. Areas like Hattisudh and Binapate are filled with city waste these days. People living close to the waste disposal sites have raised concerns about possible health hazard. Some of them have blamed the waste piles for a drop in their agricultural produce and loss of livestock to various diseases. Shakuntala Darji, a local woman in Binapate, said that the local unit should find a solution to the problem. “We cannot spend our days swatting flies that could be carrying infectious diseases. We have been living in harsh conditions here,” said Darji.The proposed waste management centre in Siddharthanagar Municipality has also been obstructed due to locals’ protest. The municipal office has purchased six bighas of land at Patkhauli in Omsatiya Rural Municipality to build the proposed garbage management centre, but the locals are against it. Shailendra Shrestha, senior engineer of the municipality, said that locals of Patkhauli have stopped them from moving ahead with the construction plan. “We are out of option. The municipality has been disposing of waste in Danda Khola, close to the no man’s land between Nepal and India, as a result.”The municipal offices of Butwal and Siddharthanagar have requested the federal government to solve the problem after the ADB cancelled the funding for waste management facilities. Following the request, the Ministry of Urban Development had conducted a feasibility study to dispose of waste somewhere in Tilottama Municipality. The ministry has not disclosed the site yet.","Published at : October 24, 2019",Butwal,Amrita Anmol
Works begin on multipurpose high dam in Lamiraha,"The President Chure Tarai Madhes Conservation Development Committee has started works of a multipurpose high dam at Lamiraha in Sainamaina Municipality, Rupandehi.The project, which is led by Sainamaina Municipality, aims to conserve the Chure area, recharge groundwater, irrigate fields and promote water tourism.Lamiraha, a 40metre lake formed by the water of Khappar Khola, is around three kilometres north from the Murgiya point of the East-West Highway. Chitra Bahadur Karki, mayor of the municipality, said the local unit also plans to construct a multipurpose water park to promote tourism and irrigate fields.“The floodwaters of monsoon can be collected in the dam. The collected water could then be used all year round,” said Karki. According to municipality officials, the office also plans to start fish farming in the dam and conduct other recreational activities by operating boats and constructing a water park. “We will also encourage locals to operate hotels and resorts to promote tourism in the area,” said Karki.Ram Bahadur Thapa, a local, said developing Lamihara as a tourist destination is a good move. “The dam will not just support tourism but will also help villagers foray into farming,” he said.Last year, President Chure Tarai Madhes Conservation Development Committee had studied the probability of a high dam in Lamiraha. According to the report, a 40m tall dam could be constructed in Lamiraha, as the Khappar Khola is a perennial river. The committee is preparing a Detailed Project Report (DPR) based on the study in the current fiscal year.Ajaya Karki, chief at the committee’s office in Butwal, said Rs 30 million has been allocated to construct the dam in the first phase. “The construction of the dam will start after the completion of the DPR,” Karki said.The municipality has also studied the possibility of operating jungle safaris in the Chure area starting from Lamiraha. According to Krishna Prasad Bhandari, chief administration officer of the municipality, the municipality has allocated sufficient budget for tourism promotion and infrastructure development in the current fiscal year.The Sainamaina archaeological site lies within a kilometre of Lamiraha, and with the construction of Buddha Park and Tharu Homestay in Sainamaina, the municipality plans to move forward with its tourism plan. “We plan to connect Lamiraha with the Buddhist circuit,” said Bishnu Paudel, general secretary of the Nepal Communist Party.","Published at : October 23, 2019",Butwal,Amrita Anmol
"Lack of toilets pushes people to poop, pee in public spaces in Taulihawa","On Saturday morning, Raju Pandey, of Pakarbhitwa in Yashodhara Rural Municipality, stepped out of a passenger bus at Taulihawa Bus Park and looked around for a public toilet. He had travelled to Taulihawa from Kathmandu.But Pandey did not find any toilet near the bus park area. “As I did not have any other alternative, I was compelled to relieve myself in the open area,” said Pandey.Like Pandey, Nandalal Yadav of Mayadevi Rural Municipality, who arrived in Taulihawa, the district headquarters of Kapilvastu, to transfer land titles in the District Land Revenue Office, also searched for a public toilet upon arriving in the area. “I struggled to find a toilet for 30 minutes, then I relieved myself at the paddy field nearby Nepali Congress Party Office. I relieved myself in the open because there were no other options left,” said Yadav.For a lack of public toilets, service seekers like Yadav, who arrive in the district headquarters for administrative works, along with other visitors and tourists, face a tough time when they have to answer a pressing call of nature. Busy spaces like Nayatol, Gaudhichowk, Chowk Bazaar, Bhikshu Chowk, Prasashan Karayala Chowk and Jamuwar Chowk do not have public toilets. And, according to locals, people peeing on roadsides is a common sight in these areas. But even in areas that do have public toilets, few people use them, for they are too dirty to use. For instance, Kapilvastu Municipality had constructed four public toilets at Land Revenue Office, Mahendra Park, Bus Park and Haat bazaar area a few years ago, but all of those toilets have left unused for a long time.“Shouldn’t the municipal office be responsible to maintain basic cleanliness of the public toilet? How can we use such dirty toilets?” asked Chadra Yadav, a local woman of Yashodhara Rural Municipality. Chandra had arrived in Taulihawa to obtain her citizenship certificate from the District Administration Office on Friday. Chandra said, “The dirty public toilets have not only affected public health but also contributed to environmental pollution. None of these public toilets is disabled-friendly as well.”A security officer from the District Police Office said that government officials too face problems because of this while on duty. “As we are in uniform, we have to stay double alert when we urinate in the open,” he said, adding that the urge to answer nature’s call becomes unbearable and there is no restroom facility in Taulihawa.Ram Bhajan Kalawar, ward chairman of Kapilvastu Municipality Ward No. 2, admitted that people are seen relieving themselves anywhere (against a wall, a tree, a corner, or open area) due to lack of a public toilet. Kalawar said, “This has dirtied the bazaar area. The local unit should take initiatives to construct toilets in Taulihawa immediately.”To tackle the issue, Kiran Singh, mayor of the municipality, said that they have a plan to provide basic sanitation facilities to locals and service seekers in the area. “The problem has arisen as the public toilets have been unused for a long time due to lack of sanitation. But another problem is that no one—not organisations nor individuals—is willing to take care of public property,” said Singh, adding that the local unit will pay attention to improve sanitation in Taulihawa soon.","Published at : October 22, 2019",Kapilvastu,Manoj Paudel
Sainamaina Municipality in Rupandehi starts conserving Budha-era archaeological sites and objects,"Efforts are ongoing to preserve Buddha-era monuments and ruins found in Sainamaina of Rupandehi district.In an initiation of Sainamaina Municipality, authorities have started preserving several archaeologically important objects and places belonging related to Gautam Buddha.The local unit has set up a temporary museum at Sirantol and kept some historic statues, bricks, utensils, tools and ruins of houses believed to have been built during the time Buddha was alive. Likewise, 11 ancient wells—including Badakuwa and Ranikuwa—have been preserved in various places in Sainamaina.Sainamaina lies a few kilometres north from Lumbini, the birthplace of Lord Buddha. New human settlements started in the area circa 1965 with the construction of the East-West Highway. According to the locals, various historically and archaeologically important objects like statuettes, kitchen utensils, bricks are frequently recovered while ploughing the field, laying the foundation for constructing sites and from the forests near to the settlements.According to Mayor Chitra Bahadur Karki, further studies and laboratory test of the historic and archaeological goods preserved in the temporary museum will be conducted to verify Sainamaina as a Buddha-era settlement. “There are several historically, culturally and archaeologically important objects and places in the area. All three level governments will conserve and promote the places and develop them as a tourist destination,” said Karki.Ministry of Urban Development of the federal government is planning to establish a museum at Bankatta in Sainamaina-1 in the current fiscal year. It is estimated that it will cost around Rs 380 million to set up the museum which covers 12 bighas of land. The federal government allocated Rs 100 million in the current fiscal year. “Physical construction of the museum will be initiated within a few months,” said Mayor Karki.The federal government has expressed its interest in preserving Sainamaina as a Buddha-era civilisation and promoting tourism there, by including it in the list of 100 new tourist destinations. Last year, the government included Sainamaina in the Buddha circuit. And the Ministry of Culture and Tourism allocated Rs 5 million budget in the last fiscal year to preserve Buddha-era monuments and ruins in Sainamaina.Sainamaina Municipality has prioritised infrastructure development to develop the area as a tourist destination. A road was constructed to link the local unit with Lumbini. “We will work together with Butwal Sub-metropolis, Lumbini and Devdaha municipalities and private sector to promote tourism in Sainamaina,” said Krishna Prasad Bhandari, administrative officer of Sainamaina.","Published at : October 21, 2019",Butwal,Amrita Anmol
Curriculum introduced to raise awareness about sickle cell anaemia,"Barbardiya Municipality has started incorporating a curriculum centred around awareness about the epidemic of sickle cell anaemia (SCA) disease. The curriculum will be taught in various schools in the district.The incorporation of the curriculum is expected to raise awareness among students about the symptoms and precautions of the disease. Sickle cell anaemia is a group of blood disorders that a person usually inherits from his/her parents.The curriculum has been designed by Dr Rajan Pandey, a doctor at Bheri Hospital, who has led the teachers through teaching procedures.“With the incorporation of the curriculum, many have felt it necessary to examine their blood before marriage,” said Durga Chaudhary, the mayor of Barbardiya. “Students are getting aware and they have started teaching their parents as well.”The disease spreads like an epidemic every year in several Tharu villages in the district. If both parents have sickle cell disease, there is a 25 percent chance the couple’s child will be born with the disease. While 50 percent of them contract the disease one way or the other, only 25 percent will remain free from it. Those affected with the disease die prematurely.The best way to eradicate risk is to examine the blood before marriage, Pandey said. “About 50 percent of infants below five who contract the disease die every year,” he said.Also recently, Bansgadhi Municipality launched a campaign to transfer students from private schools to public schools. As part of the campaign, about 700 students enrolled in public schools in the current academic year. The campaign has put pressure on public schools to ramp up their educational standards, said Shalik Ram Adhikari, the mayor of Bansgadhi.Dhani Ram Chaudhary, a secondary-level student at Jana Sewa Secondary School, said that while he used to ingest medicines for jaundice until now, he now has started taking medicines for sickle cell. “The disease was strange to me,” Chaudhary said. “It is only after reading about it on my book that I got to know about sickle cell and ways to diagnose it and precautions I need to adopt to prevent it in the future.” In addition to awareness about anaemia, the redesigned curriculum, which targets primary-level students, also includes lessons on local culture and tradition.","Published at : October 18, 2019",Bardiya,Thakur Singh Tharu
Police in Banke arrest a sub-inspector over an attempt to rape charge,"A female trainee at the Karnali Province Police Training Centre on October 14 lodged a complaint saying Sub-Inspector Bam Bahadur Rana attempted to rape her in his room inside the training centre.Rana was arrested the same day, said Deputy Superintendent of Police Shiva Singh, spokesperson for the District Police Office, Banke. In her complaint, according to the police office, the trainee said Rana called her to his room on the pretext of letting her use his mobile phone to call her parents. When she entered the room, Rana locked the door and made inappropriate advances, according to her. As per the rules, trainees are not allowed to keep mobile phones with them during the training period. The accused is the accuser’s brother-in-law, said Singh. According to Singh, more details will be unveiled after the investigation is completed. “The family of the accuser is not convinced that such an incident took place, but we have already launched an investigation,” Singh told the Post. “The victim has filed an attempt to rape complaint and investigation is ongoing as per the complaint,” said Singh. The court is set to start the proceedings.According to DSP Madhusudhan Neupane from the Police Training Centre, the woman is still coming to training despite being subjected to such behaviour. “She comes to the training in tears, and has refused to meet or talk to anyone, including her relatives,” said Neupane. This incident is the first attempt to rape case relating to a police official, and it comes amid concerns over the high prevalence of cases that show sexual assaults against women in the country, particularly by men in power.","Published at : October 17, 2019",Nepalgunj,Madhu Shahi
Nearly two dozen Chand party cadres arrested in biggest police raid yet on the outfit,"In one of the biggest mass arrests, police rounded up 21 leaders and cadres of the Netra Bikram Chand-led Communist Party of Nepal in Dang district late Wednesday night.“The arrests were made from a jungle in Dang’s Mugretha Khola of Rajapur Rural Municipality, which borders India, past midnight on Wednesday,” said Deputy Superintendent Binod Bikram Shah of the Dang District Police Office.According to police, the Chand party members had just concluded a meeting when the police raided the building, which is around five hours’ walk from the nearest police station. The party was reportedly preparing a strategy for the upcoming by-elections. Acting on a tip-off, the Provincial Police Office in Tulsipur, District Police Office, Area Police Office in Gadhawa, and Lamahi ward police office deployed security personnel in the area in plainclothes. A police team led by Bharat Rathour, an inspector at the Gadhawa Area Police Office, surrounded the house after party members had gone to bed. Around 60 police personnel, along with 21 others from the Armed Police Force, were deployed as reinforcements. Upon encirclement, seven or eight armed sentries fled the scene, according to police. The forests around the Maretha stream are considered a safe space for rebels. Police said they travelled around six kilometres by road and walked around three hours to reach the meeting site. This area was also used by the CPN (Maoist) during the decade-long insurgency. Wednesday night’s police action follows months of calm regarding the activities of the Chand party. Sources in the government said the arrests were based on a tip-off that the outfit was planning “something big”.The government declared the Chand party a criminal outfit and banned its activities in March following two explosions in the Capital that killed one person and injured two others in February. The party has long been involved in extortion and attacks on private companies. It has turned down the government’s call for talks, putting forth three conditions instead—lifting of its ban, unconditional release of its arrested leaders, and an “official invite” for talks. The Communist Party of Nepal is a breakaway faction of the Maoist party that waged a decade-long war against the state from 1996 to 2006. Chand formed his party in 2014 to launch what he calls “unified revolution”. Chand, along with Mohan Baidya, had left Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s Maoist party in 2012, six years after the end of the war, saying that the Maoist chief had deviated from their ideology and had abandoned the revolution halfway. But Chand too decided to walk away from Baidya after “ideological differences” emerged, especially with Ram Bahadur Thapa, the incumbent home minister. Thapa had also left Dahal’s party along with Chand and Baidya. So far, at least eight Chand party cadres have died. Two were killed in police action while five others died when cooking gas cylinders they were trying to rig as explosives went off in Kathmandu. One cadre was killed in Dhangadhi when an improvised explosive device he was carrying went off suddenly. Government officials believe that the Chand party has lately been quiet as it was trying to strengthen its organisational structure with a view to launching a “major action”, targeting the upcoming by-elections scheduled for November 30.“Police swung into action after a tip-off that some major leaders of the Chand party were planning a gathering,” said Indrajit Rai, security adviser to Home Minister Thapa. “The Chand party had been planning to head towards confrontation [with the state].”Those arrested include Chand’s elder brother Chandra Bahadur Chand ‘Birjung’, a central committee member who is also Lumbini bureau and mid-western command in-charge of the party.Other leaders arrested during the raid include Rapti bureau in-charge Kesh Bahadur Bantha, Rapti bureau coordinator Ram Bahadur Thapa, Rapti bureau secretary Sabin Pokhrel, Dang district in-charge Yamlal Katuwal, district secretary Pradip Oli, the youth organisation’s central chairman Babin KC, party’s intellectual organisation member Sunil Poudel, district civil council member Ek Rak Chaudhary, and Rajapur Rural Municipality secretary Dhan Bahadur Bohara.Likewise, district in-charge of Rastriya Dalit Morcha Suraj BK, Rapti bureau members Tilak Pun, Hit Prasad Rokka, Post Man Gharti, Dal Bahadur Khatri, Amit Gharti Magar, Bal Krishna Sharma, Jit Chhetri, Ramesh Acharya, Bishnu Thapa, and Kul Bahadur Oli were also arrested by police.With the arrest of nearly two dozen leaders in a single raid, there are concerns about retaliatory action from the Chand party.On multiple occasions in the past, security experts have told the Post that the government needs to avoid its confrontational approach and convince the Chand party to come to the negotiating table.","Published at : October 17, 2019",Dang,Durga Lal KC
Tree issue puts Butwal-Narayangadh road expansion on hold,"Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli had laid the foundation stone of the Butwal-Narayangadh road expansion of the East-West Highway some seven months ago. However, the expansion work has yet to start because of an issue over felling of trees along the section.The Butwal-Narayangadh Road Upgradation Project said it could not initiate the road expansion work as the number of trees to be cut down along the road stretch was fivefold more than what is mentioned in the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA). The government had conducted the EIA in 2016 that stated that 9,027 trees had to be cut down on both sides of the road stretch for the expansion work. However, the number of trees that have to be cut down has now reached 50,352. A fresh assessment was conducted before the project’s launch.“A difference of around 20 percent in the total number is natural. But there is a huge difference. We are trying to find the reason for the discrepancy. And efforts are on to make a change to the Environment Management Plan,” said Suresh Neupane, chief engineer at the project. According to him, a file into the matter has been sent to the Ministry of Forest and Environment. Neupane surmised the difference in the number was possible since the consultant company assessed the number of trees on a sampling basis without conducting a detailed count.Besides the issue of felling trees, electricity poles installed along the road stretch also pose difficulties for the road expansion work. Transmission lines of 132kV, 33kV and 11kV run along the road section. Around 4,840 poles need to be shifted to initiate the project. The cost of moving the poles and installing new electricity wires is estimated at Rs750million. For the road expansion work along the Butwal-Narayangadh, the government has allocated Rs16.99 billion 85 percent of which will be covered by loan assistance from the Asian Development Bank. As per the plan, the existing two-lane road will be upgraded to six lanes within the next four years. However, along the 12-km hill terrain along the Daunne section, the road will only be three-lane wide. The Butwal-Narayangadh road stretch is 113km long.The Department of Roads had signed an agreement with China State Construction Engineering Corporation in February 2019 to implement the project.","Published at : October 17, 2019",Rupandehi,Ghanshyam Gautam
Cases of polygamy unchecked in several districts of Province 5,"Radhika Bishwakarma’s husband, Dhak Bahadur Kami, brought home his second wife on the day of Teej this year. A resident of Belbas, Radhika filed a polygamy case against her husband and his second wife. The case is pending at the Rupandehi District Court.Krishna Pandey’s wife, who asked her name to be withheld for privacy reasons, also recently lodged a complaint at the Area Police Office in Butwal against her husband for practising polygamy. The Pandey household was preparing for festivities on the 10th day of Dasain when Pandey walked into the house with his new wife. “I immediately lodged a complaint at the police station,” said the first wife. Her husband and the father of their two children is since on the run along with his second wife. Manju Shrestha of Dipnagar in Butwal is a mother of three children. Her husband, Prakash Shrestha, a foreign employment returnee, brought home a second wife with a five-month-old daughter. Manju frequented the local police station and the Office of the District Attorney to register a complaint against the new couple on polygamy charge. But she gave up her plan to file the case after learning that the five-month-old baby would be recognised as their legal offspring in accordance with the existing legal provisions. Her husband, Prakash, is currently living with his second wife while Manju and her children are living separately after taking their property share.“Though the law states that second marriage is automatically annulled, it is indirectly recognised. Victim of polygamy like me is deprived of justice as the perpetrators give birth to a baby secretly and bring them home later,” said Manju. “The child is legally recognised as the husband’s so annulment of the second marriage is out of the question.” A clause in the Civil and Criminal Code 2017 outlaws polygamy whereas another clause says that a couple would be deemed married if their physical relations result in childbirth. As many as 157 cases related to polygamy were registered with the police in Province 5 in the last fiscal year. Forty-four of these cases were registered in Rupandehi alone. Thirty-four polygamy cases have been registered in Province 5 in the past two months of the current fiscal year.According to the police, laws alone are not enough to abolish the deeply rooted social evils like polygamy. Mina Acharya, assistant sub-inspector at women and children service centre in Rupandehi, opined that cases of polygamy are unchecked mainly due to lax legal provisions. “Social campaigns are essential to sensitise people about social evils and the authorities must introduce strong legal provisions,” she asserted. If proven guilty of polygamy, a person is jailed for one to three years in accordance with the Civil and Criminal Code. A case related to polygamy should be filed within three months of the second marriage.","Published at : October 17, 2019",Butwal,Amrita Anmol
Free Kamalaris are becoming self-reliant in Dang,"Namita Chaudhary of Bagarapur in Rapti Rural Municipality, who was a former kamalari, an indentured girl child labourer, is preparing to start a business. She recently underwent training to be a cook which has enabled her to look into starting something on her own.“I had spent my childhood working as domestic help. But now I am opting for various income-generating ideas through skills and training. I have received training to operate a hotel. Finally, I don’t have to rely on others for survival,” said Namita.Namita had stayed in Ghorahi, the district headquarters of Dang, for 18 days to complete her training. Like Namita, other 31 former kamalaries of western Tarai received the same training. The Freed Kamalari Development Forum, a joint effort of former kamalaris, trained them and also provided utensils worth Rs 15,000-Rs 21,000 and Rs 25,000 cash to each of them to operate a hotel.Sabitri Chaudhary of Bansgadhi in Bardiya said she had to endure hardships and face humiliation in society due to her poor economic condition. “Despite such hurdles, I did not give up on my struggle. Now that I have received the training, I’m confident enough to start a business,” said Sabitri. Geeta Chaudhary of Dangisharan said that she too will run an eatery in her own village with the help she has received. Geeta said, “We have been trained to prepare various snacks and meals and also received utensils and cash to operate a business.”The government declared Kamaiyas free back in July 2000. Sushila Chaudhary, treasurer of the Freed Kamalari Development Forum, said that they have been providing training to former kamalaris to make them self reliant and show them the way to financial independence. She said, “The forum has been advocating for the education, employment and empowerment of former kamalaris.” According to Sushila, freed kamalaris constructed a three-storey building at Chaughera in Ghorahi at a cost of around Rs 9.7 million. The building is where the training and the programmes for the Kamalaris are conducted. She said, “The construction was completed some four months ago. The government provided Rs 8 million under the Tarai-Madhes Prosperity Programme and the rest while the former kamalaris put together the remaining amount from their own savings.”Sunita Chaudhary, the central chairperson of the forum, said freed Kamalaris gather in the building and prepare various plans and policies to launch various income-generating programmes. “We did not have our own houses in the past. The building now not only works as a place of learning for us, but as our identity,” said Sunita. “Many friends have initiated their own businesses by learning various skills here. The number of the former kamalaris who have become self-reliant is gradually increasing.”According to Sunita, around 50 percent of the income the forum generates by providing training and skills is spent on managing the building, and the other 50 percent is used to assist former kamalaris who need help.Forty-three cooperatives have been established in five western Tarai districts for the upliftment of the economic status of former kamalaris. According to the forum, around Rs95 million has been mobilised through the cooperatives to uplift the status of the freed kamalaris. Some former kamalaris have started their own businesses by taking a loan from the cooperatives.As many as 9,661 former kamalaris are members of the forum now. Three hundred and thirty-one people have received short-term training for income generation so far. And from a total of 270 people who received long-term training by the forum, 72 are working in various institutions currently.","Published at : October 16, 2019",Dang,Durgalal KC
Province 5 continues its integrated settlement drive,"This year too the Province 5 government is continuing with its integrated settlement development programmes in Mahat and Hukam, which were devastated during the decade-long Maoist insurgency in Rukum (East).For the programme, the government has allocated Rs 5 billion. According to Tej Bahadur Oli, a member of the provincial assembly, the fund will be used to manage settlement areas, upgrade roads, courtyards, and build kitchen gardens and maintain sanitation in the village.In the first phase, last fiscal year, the government had allocated Rs 5 million to construct roads and install solar lights along the road in Mahat. Oli said that around 800 metres of a permanent road was constructed and solar lights were installed in the village.“The road which links the village to Rukumkot, the district headquarters, is now motorable making it easy for the locals to travel,” said Dev Bahadur Budha, ward chairman, who says the programme has greatly facilitated villagers. The road was upgraded as part of the programme last year.Hundreds of people were displaced and 58 people were killed in Mahat during the insurgency. Local and provincial governments are trying to compensate for the loss through several development programmes.The local unit has installed a bust of Gautam Buddha and constructed a memorial park in Mahat to commemorate war victims. “Many villagers lost their lives and properties during the war-era. We are only trying to empathise with the victims’ families through development programmes,” said Ramsur Budha Magar, chairman at Bhume Rural Municipality. The provincial government also has allocated Rs 5 million for an integrated development programme at Hukam village in Puthauttarganga Rural Municipality. Hukam is also one of the conflict-affected areas in the district. According to the authorities, the budget will be used to manage the settlement and upgrade roads and other infrastructures in Hukam.","Published at : October 15, 2019",Rukum (east),Hari Gautam
Road condition the major stumbling block for Lumbini’s tourism year goal,"While all eyes might have been on the Visit Nepal 2020, Province 5 is currently observing Lumbini Travel Year 2076, which has set a target of welcoming two million visitors. But while the provincial government has ramped up its publicity, little effort has gone into improving the road structure in the west’s tourism hotspot.Roads leading to Buddha’s birthplace and other sites of historical importance await construction, facelift or expansion. As a result, even though six months have passed on the Nepali calendar year, Lumbini hasn’t seen an increase in the number of tourists. At this point, the government’s target of bringing in two million visitors looks like a far cry.The most used road to Lumbini—that charts Belahiya-Bhairahawa-Lumbini—is in a state of disrepair. Similar is the case with other two road sections—Taulihawa-Lumbini and Butwal-Bethari-Lumbini. The roads were dug up two years ago in order to reconstruct them. As of now, they lie in disarray with potholes dotting the stretches.This has met with repulsion from the tourists. “I found it very hard to reach Lumbini and return unlike what I had expected,” said Saroj Shiwakoti, from Nepalgunj, who was recently in Lumbini for a vacation. “I can’t recommend my friends to visit Lumbini.”The 41km Bhairahawa-Lumbini-Taulihawa road stretch is being reconstructed with the financial aid from the Asian Development Bank. The reconstruction was expected to be completed within two and a half years. But two years on, only 30 percent of it is complete, according to officials. Only two out of five bridges on the road sections have been completed.Meghraj Marasini, chief engineer at the Division Road Office in Butwal, blamed the contractor’s incompetence for the road project delay. “We are preparing to scrap the contract with the current contractor and grant it to another,” Marasini said.The Bhairahawa-Lumbini road section is just 24 km but it takes over an hour and a half to cross it, said Janak Thapa, a local of Bhairahawa. The condition is pretty much the same with the other two road sections, Thapa added.Amid all this, the provincial government, however, seems indifferent. Provincial Minister for Industry, Tourism, Forest and Environment Leela Giri said that because the roads are under the central government, the provincial government is unable to lead the reconstruction works. “We have repeatedly requested the central government to pay heed to this,” Giri said. “But things haven’t gone as planned.”Lumbini is now launching campaigns to preserve Buddhist rituals and publicise Buddha’s birth site. But this alone is unlikely to increase the number of tourists.According to Lumbini Development Trust, a total of 101,269 foreign tourists have visited Lumbini in the first eight months of 2019. The figure is only 7,461 more compared to the same period last year.While the condition of the roads has already taken a toll on Lumbini Visit Year, its implications look far-reaching, especially in view of the oncoming Visit Nepal 2020.“Proper transportation is fundamental to tourism promotion,” said Sanjay Wajimaya, a tourism entrepreneur and former chief of Lumbini Tour and Travels Association. “If this fundamental necessity is overlooked, it’s hard to meet the expected target despite any extent of hype and campaigning.”","Published at : October 14, 2019",Butwal,Amrita Anamol
Movement to reform education system takes off in Dang,"In Dang, local units have started a movement to reform the local education system.As part of this initiative, Tulsipur Sub-metropolis has started to merge community schools whereas Rapti Rural Municipality has started to provide primary education free of cost. At the 54th executive meeting of the sub-metropolis, it was decided that schools would have an Early Childhood Development Centre instead of classes (grade one up to grade five). Mukunda Rijal, an official at the Education Section, said that the Early Childhood Development Centre will run regularly. And according to him, 35 schools have decided to implement the centre, which will be teaching students in the English language.The sub-metropolis is also preparing to adjust the number for teachers in each school as per the number of students, as there are some schools that have too many students and too few teachers and vice versa. The number of students in the majority of the schools in the area is below 100. Bhaskar Raj Gautam, chief at the Education Section of the sub-metropolis, said that they have started to identify the schools that have few students. “We cannot keep providing a salary to teachers,” said Gautam, adding that teachers who are currently teaching in schools with few students will be transferred to schools where teachers are less and students aplenty.According to the data of the Education Section, 58 teachers have already been transferred to other schools in the last academic year.Gautam said that they have also been moving forward with the concept of forming a “mega-school”, a merger of a number of community schools. There are 83 community schools in total in the sub-metropolis. According to Gautam, the plan is to merge schools and limit the number of schools in the Sub Metropolis to 30.Ghana Shyam Pandey, chief at the sub-metropolis, said, “Our plan is to cancel classes and merge schools to cut expenses. We have decided to take the decision following many field studies.” He also added that they are going to pass the education act to roll out the campaign. Meanwhile, Rapti Rural Municipality has started to provide primary education free of cost. Numananda Subedi, chairman of the rural municipality, said that they have been spending Rs 11.1 million for the salary and allowances of teachers (who were appointed through the private fund of the schools) every year.Subedi said, “The students at the primary level are studying free of cost after the local unit provided the salary and allowance to the teachers who have been appointed through the private fund of the schools. Because of this, the dropout rate has reduced.”Other local units like Shantinagar and Bangalachuli Rural Municipalities have also monitoring government schools to ensure quality education in the district.","Published at : October 11, 2019",Dang,Durgalal KC
Land encroachment by commercial and private buildings slows Lumbini Provincial hospital upgradation plan,"Upgradation of Lumbini Provincial Hospital in Butwal is one of the major priorities set by the Province 5 government.The plan, however, has not progressed smoothly, as the hospital’s property has been encroached upon by private homes and commercial buildings. As per the record available at the District Survey Office, the hospital currently owns about six bighas, though the land-ownership certificate issued in 1995 shows that the hospital owns eight bighas land.The survey office said the hospital’s land was encroached upon time and again while expanding the highway and roads around it. “We could not reclaim the encroached land because of a measurement problem in the land map. We are now preparing to acquire land from the forest office to develop the master plan for the hospital,” said Krishna Prasad Khanal, the medical superintendent of the hospital.The hospital is planning to acquire one bigha and four katthas land from the forest office. The provincial government has formed a committee under Ishwor Gautam, the vice-chairman of the provincial planning commission, to prepare a master plan for the upgradation of the hospital. The master plan envisages increasing the hospital’s bed capacity to 950 from the current 260 beds, upgrading the medical testing facilities and building a separate diagnostic building to operate CT scan and MRI facilities, among others. As part of the master plan, a six-storey hospital building is currently under construction at the cost of Rs 170 million.","Published at : October 4, 2019",Rupandehi,Ghanshyam Gautam
Women victims of conflict era in Rupandehi demand identity card,"“Our sindoor (vermilion powder worn by married women as a symbol of marriage) was wiped out for the constitution, but we got nothing in return,” laments Goma Bashyal, who lost her husband to the Maoist war. “The government has denied us justice. My husband wasn’t even declared a martyr.”Her husband, Bhabishwor, was killed on April 24, 2001. He was 21 when he was killed. Goma was barely 18 then and pregnant with her son. “It makes me sad to tell my son what happened to his father,” Goma said. “And I don’t even have a war-victim identity card that would allow me to use state allowances set aside for war victims.” Goma has spent countless days seeking justice, but the state has remained unresponsive, she says.Janaki Ghimire Aryal of Motipur echoes Goma’s sentiments. Her husband, Giri Prasad, was killed by the Nepal Army at his own house. After the tragedy, Janaki went abroad for work. Since she returned, she has been active in seeking justice but to no avail. “The state has completely ignored us,” Janaki said.Janaki is a member of the Single Women’s Association, which has been demanding ‘identity cards’ that give them a war-victim identity and declare their husbands as martyrs. The government has allocated reservations for 13 groups, such as women, disabled and marginalised communities. The association wants war victims to be provided with a reservation as well.But since the government has not yet given the right for single women to pass their dead husband’s property to their name, many widows of the war-era find themselves facing an uncertain future.Shiva Prasad Gaudel, a rights activist with Advocacy Forum Rupandehi, said that the state has detached itself from its responsibility which is to implement the constitution while also addressing the demands of war victims. “The state provided assurance but didn’t work towards the desired effect,” Gaudel said. “Many victims are entirely aversive, even vengeful, towards the state.”However, Kul Prasad KC, provincial minister of law and internal affairs, said that the victims should move on now and shouldn’t be fixated on wartime issues. “We should focus on how to solve the issue,” he said, vaguely. “Most of their demands are directed towards the central government. The federal government is always ready to cooperate.”Meanwhile, Devisara Oli, whose husband was disappeared by the state during the war, said that she has been left with few options in life since she lost her husband. “We have lost our hopes for justice now,” Devisara said. “The least we expect now is a war-victim identity card.”","Published at : October 1, 2019",Butwal,Amrita Anmol
"For Chepang locals, government services are 80 km away","Before the federal setup came into place, locals of Chepang village in Bardiya used would visit the then VDC office for administrative work. Procuring recommendation letters for citizenship certificates, registration of birth, marriage, and death, among other administrative work, was done in the village itself. But now they have to go to the district headquarters, Gulariya, for all administrative works.As the local units were introduced, locals in far-flung municipalities were hopeful they would receive government services more easily; however, the establishment of the local unit did not ease their troubles. “We have to go to the district headquarters to use government services. Even though there’s a municipal office in our village, it is of little help to us,” said Laxmi Shahi, a local of Chepang village.“When the municipal office was set up, we were hoping for better services at our village but that hasn’t happened yet,” said Sundar Gurung, a local of Chepang. Locals said that they have to travel to Gulariya even to pay their electricity bills. Chepang village is around 80km from Gulariya and lies on the eastern border of Bardiya National Park.Shankar Prasad Chaudhary, chief at the District Coordination Committee, said that they are unable to establish offices in Chepang village due to lack of human resources. “We first have to make arrangements to hire employees for the offices at the local level. Once that is taken care of then the locals wouldn’t need to travel to Gulariya to get their work done,” said Chaudhary.","Published at : September 28, 2019",Bardiya,Thakur Singh Tharu
Meet Dang’s barefoot Dungli,"Dungli Chaudhary from Ghorahi has never worn a pair of slippers—or shoes, for that matter—in her entire life. Neither does she want to, she says.Chaudhary says she wanted to wear new clothes when she got married and wanted to walk around decked up in colourful attire. But never got the chance. Her husband, Kali Prasad Chaudhary, had been a bonded labour for 18 years and she too spent her childhood as one. And soon after they got married, her husband went back to being a bonded labourer. She stayed back without her husband, tending cattle and doing household chores. She used to wake up at 3 am and would have to prepare 320 rotis by 6 am for her new joint family, which was made of 18 members. The family had 35 goats and as many cows and pigs. Her life was in disarray back then, she remembers wistfully. She had asked her in-laws to buy her a pair of slippers and chura, but her request went unheeded. It was around that time she decided to stop wearing slippers. “I used to go to the jungle barefoot,” she said. “I was used to walking barefoot everywhere. My maternal family was so poor they couldn’t afford a pair of slippers. Same was the case when I got married. I promised myself that I would never ever wear slippers of churapote or ornaments.” She has since then never gone back on her promise to herself.Chaudhary is 49 now. Her husband 57. This is the age that’s marked in their citizenship certificates but she believes she is older than that now. She is the mother of two sons and two daughters, who occasionally bring her slippers but she never wears them. Not being able to deny outright, she carries the slippers in her hand and once she reaches her home, she throws them away.Chaudhary’s family currently lives in Parsa village in Ghorahi, 7km from the district headquarters. She walks to Ghorahi barefoot. “I travel barefoot even when I have to go to the bazaar,” said Chaudhary. “I even went to Swargadwari temple in Pyuthan barefoot. My friends would ask me to wear slippers and would offer money but I didn’t want to wear them.”When asked why she refuses to wear one even today when she has no financial problem to speak of, she says that her feet have become acclimated to the ground. “I didn’t get to wear them when I wanted to, and I haven’t worn them so far, why should I start wearing them now when death is so near?” she said.But walking barefoot comes with its difficulties. Chaudhary has many times broken her toenails. While earlier she used to feel pain when pebbles and thrones would pierce her feet, she says she has now become inured to it.During winter, however, she has devised a method to keep her feet warm: She drinks a glass of local alcohol. “Doctors have asked me to cut down on alcohol. The enmity with slippers has lessened my life expectancy,” she says. “But at this age, I don’t have to go back to wearing slippers.”","Published at : September 26, 2019",Dang,Durgalal KC
Health services at Rapti Academy of Health Sciences affected due to doctors’ protest,"Services at the Rapti Academy of Health Sciences in Dang has been affected for the last month because of the doctors’ protest. The hospital receives around 80 to 90 patients on a daily basis, but it has been referring patients to other hospitals, according to Laxmi Acharya, secretary of Ghorahi Civil Society.Ram Moti Chaudhary of Gorahi, who had visited the hospital after suffering from stomach problems, said the hospital referred him to another hospital in Nepalgunj after conducting a preliminary checkup. In the past month, the hospital has not admitted a single patient due to a lack of medical specialists. Keshav Kumar Sharma, the district coordinator of the Human Rights Network, said the doctors’ protest has left all the beds in the hospital empty. Sharma, who inspected the hospital on Sunday, said, “There are no doctors in the hospital. Patients have been returning without receiving treatment.” According to Sharma, the hospital should coordinate with the agitating doctors and put an end to the strike. The agitating doctors have been protesting against vice-chancellor Dr Sangita Bhandari, claiming that she misbehaved with them and repeatedly threatened to terminate them. On August 24, 23 doctors resigned en masse citing physical and mental pressure from the hospital administration. Bhandari had approved the resignation of all doctors on the same day. “The hospital has stopped conducting medical treatment even for victims of violence, women and children. Critical patients are being referred to other hospitals,” Acharya said.Rapti Sub Regional Hospital, the biggest hospital in Rapti, was converted into Rapti Academy of Health Sciences in 2018. Around 2.3 million people from Rapti and its surrounding areas depend on the hospital for treatment.According to the hospital data, around 400 patients used to receive treatment from the hospital daily. Vice-chancellor Bhandari said two medical specialists and a medical officer are currently providing health services at the hospital. “We have appointed one medical specialist, but he has yet to join the academy,” Bhandari said.","Published at : September 25, 2019",Dang,Durgalal KC
"In Bardiya, even elected Dalit representatives face caste-based bigotry","Hari Prasad Pasi was elected as the chairman of Ward No. 9 in Gulariya Municipality during the local election held in 2017. During the election campaign, Pasi was committed to fighting for equality and publicly vowed to work against deeply rooted caste-based discrimination.But things have not gone according to plan. Despite being the chairman of a local unit, Pasi, a Dalit himself, has been subjected to caste-based discrimination.“People chant slogans against caste discrimination in public places and others also join in,” said Pasi. “But when we pay a visit to their homes, they serve us food in utensils separated for Dalits. The so-called upper caste people are reluctant to take my counsel and suggestions. They do not answer my “namaste” when they come to the ward office,” added Pasi, saying that untouchability and caste-based discrimination may have taken a backseat in public places and platforms but it is still prevalent on an individual level.“Untouchability and caste-based discrimination still prevail in our society,” said Pasi, adding that one could easily imagine the plight of ordinary Dalit people when an elected representative such as himself was discriminated in the community that he supposedly represents. He voices his concern over the future of Dalits, and their illiteracy, lack of awareness and poverty that burdens them. There are around 500 Dalit people at Ward No. 9 of Gulariya. “However, only five Dalit people have passed the SEE (Secondary Education Examination) so far,” said Pasi. “Dalits do not have easy access to health and education. The problem of caste-based discrimination cannot be resolved without education and mass awareness.”The dropout rate of Dalit students is also quite high. According to Pasi, the dropout rate of Dalit students up to class five is around 20 to 25 percent. “I have been doing my best to convince Dalit people to send their wards to school for education,” he said.“A huge number of people asked voters not to support me during the election. They were worried that they would have to greet me and take service from me if I won the election,” he said.The situation of other elected representatives is exactly the same. Binita Adhikari Pariyar, a ward member as well as an executive committee from ward 9, said that people still discriminated her for being a Dalit. “Some Dalit friends even complained to me that they are made to eat on leaves while working in the field with non-Dalits,” she said.Mayor Muktinath Yadav said many Dalit children were deprived of school education mainly due to poverty and lack of awareness. He assured he would launch various programmes to improve the situation of Dalits soon.","Published at : September 25, 2019",Bardiya,Kamal Panthi
"Around 1,600 children deprived of citizenship in Nawalparasi (West)","A group of youths, who are without their citizenship certificates in Nawalparasi (West), have submitted a memorandum to the Prime Minister through the Chief District Officer demanding citizenship by descent or birth. The parents of the youths are citizens by birth.On May 7, the Supreme Court issued an interim order to stop granting citizenship by descent to individuals whose parents obtained citizenship by birth in 1997, under the recommendation of a committee led by Jitendra Dev. On April 2, the Home Ministry had issued a circular to all the 77 chief district officers asking them to grant citizenship by descent to individuals whose parents are citizens by birth. The District Administration Office had then started issuing citizenship by descent to the children of citizens by birth. Within the time period, around 826 people (whose parents are citizens by birth) obtained citizenship in the district.However, around 1,600 individuals, who filed applications in the District Administration Office demanding citizenship certificates around six months ago, remain deprived of their citizenship certificates.Manish Agrahari of Ramgram, who is a recent high school graduate, was among the youths who were in the District Administration Office on Monday worried about his future. “I want to go abroad to pursue further studies but I don’t have my citizenship certificate. I need the certificate to make my passport,” he said. For lack of a citizenship certificate, he has put his plans on hold for now. “My parents are citizens by birth. But I haven’t been issued one. I don’t know what my future holds.”Rabin Paswan of Pratappur, also a recent high school graduate, went to Butwal to join a college to study medicine but was denied admission since he too did not have his citizenship certificate. “Not having a citizenship certificate has robbed me of my future.”Rakesh Chandra Thakur, who is the chairman of a “struggle group” formed to demand justice for the children of those individuals whose parents are citizens by birth, said that they have been protesting against the discriminatory decision of the Supreme Court. Thakur said, “We are born in this country and our parents are Nepali citizens. But we haven’t been issued our citizenship certificates. This is unfair.”Prior to the Supreme Court’s order, children of parents who had their citizenship certificate by birth were issued citizenship by descent. However, the ones who did not receive their citizenship certificates now seek one either by birth or descent. “Our lives have been put on hold for lack of our citizenship certificates. The government should not stop us from pursuing higher education. If there are no laws that allow us to study or find jobs then the government should make one. It shouldn’t make us suffer this way,” said Thakur.Meanwhile, Shambhu Prasad Marasini, chief district officer, said that they have stopped the distribution of citizenship certificates to the children of those individuals whose parents are citizens by birth after the Home Ministry issued a circular. “We will again grant citizenship after the Home Ministry directs us to issue citizenship by descent to the children of citizens by birth,” said Marasini.","Published at : September 24, 2019",Parasi,Nabin Paudel
Archaeological site believed to be from the Buddha-era lies neglected,"Artefacts and ruins unearthed by archaeologists in Ramgram Municipality, Nawalparasi, are lying in abandoned conditions. Concerned locals say neither the Department of Archaeology nor the local government has initiated efforts to conserve the ancient valuables discovered during an excavation carried out in Panditpur area in 2013. Some historians and archaeologists believe the ruins and artefacts date back to the Mouryan-era and that Panditpur could have been the capital of the ancient Koliya state, the parental home of Buddha’s mother, Mayadevi. These claims are yet to be verified by the Department of Archeology, but there is no contesting that the ruins and relics discovered at the site belonged to the ancient time, thus needing immediate conservation plans. The artefacts collected from the ruins have been kept in a room of the ward office. But locals say they are at risk of theft and damage due to a lack of proper storage facility.“The authorities concerned have neglected the historically important site and artefacts. There has been no effort whatsoever to preserve and promote them,” said Sailesh Mahato, a Ramgram resident.Mahato and other Ramgram locals have long been demanding the authorities concerned to conserve the archaeological dig site and the unearthed artefacts.They believe that Panditpur area could be developed into a tourist site with little investment and work. Although the Department of Archeology had announced a plan to establish a museum in the area and conserve the excavation site, but nothing has come of it till date. The team of archaeologists that made the discovery of the ruins had submitted a report, along with some archaeological evidence, suggesting that the possibility of Panditpur being the paternal home of Buddha’s mother. Ram Kunwar, an archaeologist with the Department of Archaeology, said there should be further study to confirm the claims about Panditpur. “Several archaeological evidence and historical facts have been collected. There should be further investigation on the basis of these findings,” Kunwar The team from the Department of Archeology had conducted the excavation in around 60 bighas of land in Panditpur. Much of the dig site is now privately owned property. “In order to conserve the site, we are holding discussions with the local government and the landowners to acquire the land,” Kunwar said.Meanwhile, Narendra Kumar Gupta, the mayor of Ramgram Municipality, dismissed the claims made by some of the locals that his office had not been doing enough to conserve the excavation site and the discovered artefacts. “The municipal office has placed a great importance to the site. We are currently preparing a master plan to preserve and promote Panditpur and Ramgram Stupa and link the sites with other important places related to Buddha,” said Gupta.","Published at : September 20, 2019",Parasi,Nabin Paudel
More than two dozen assault cases registered with Rupandehi police in the last two years,"On Sunday, Mahendra Kurmi of Patkhauli in Omsatiya, Rupandehi, was shot dead by unidentified persons while returning home from the bank. According to police, he had withdrawn Rs 500,000 from the Bhairahawa-based Himalayan Bank. Two motorcycles followed Kurmi, shot him and ran away with the money. The incident site is around 5km east from Bhairahawa, the district headquarters of Rupandehi.On March 27, a 43-year-old Indian national Firoj Khan was shot dead by a sharpshooter at Gadhitol in Butwal. He was returning home from work when the incident occurred. Police claimed that Firoj’s wife carried out the murder.On July 2, an unidentified person shot Resham Kumari Malla, chairperson of Gaindahawa Lake Repair and Sanitation Consumer’s Committee, and looted Rs 460,000 from her when she was returning home after withdrawing cash from Agricultural Development Bank in Lumbini.On May 16, Jhinak Dhobi, an Indian national was found with a pistol at Piparaiya in Siddharthanagar. Dhobi was found with the pistol during regular police checking along the Nepal-India border area. The above cases highlight the increasing instances of locals’ possessing and using small assault weapons to rob, extort and kill in Rupandehi. According to the District Police Office, Rupandehi, in the last two years, more than two dozen cases of assault using small weapons have been registered with the police in the district. Possession of illegal small assault weapons is mainly due to the porous border and lax security checks at the border point, said Hridaya Thapa, superintendent of police in Rupandehi. “There are security challenges in the district. Firearms can be easily purchased in the bordering Indian villages; smuggling of small firearms in the district is becoming a major security threat in the district.”Santosh Pandey, a provincial lawmaker from Rupandehi Constituency-3, said that residents of his constituency have started expressing concerns about their safety after instances of daylight robbery began making headlines in the district. “Even those in Bhairawaha feel unsafe amidst these growing instances of assaults and murders,” said Pandey. The Rupandehi district is gradually transforming from a sleepy border area to a developing trade and tourism hub, but traders and tourism entrepreneurs fear that the increase in criminal activities in the district is working against the district’s ambition to expand commercially.Kul Prasad Neupane, chairman of Siddhartha Chamber of Commerce and Industry, who was also victim to assault two years ago, said, “An unidentified man shot me while I was at my shop. The perpetrator is still at large. The business community does not feel safe doing business in Rupandehi anymore.”Stressing on the need to have a stringent security system in place at the border checkpoints, Sanjaya Bajimaya, a tourism entrepreneur, said, “Unlawful activities can be controlled only if the concerned officials tighten security at the border area. It’s the responsibility of the nation to protect its citizens.” According to Bajimaya, the checkpoint at Bhiarahawa-Sunauli border currently does not have strict security checks. Security officials do not even verify the names of individuals or run X-ray machine checks in the border area. Hridaya Thapa, superintendent of police, agrees that there are security challenges in the district. “Both the Nepal Police and Armed Police Force should conduct tighter surveillance in the border area to maintain peace and security in the district. There should be 24-hour security monitoring in the border area,” he said.Meanwhile, Mahadev Pantha, chief district officer, said that smuggling of small firearms and drugs and human trafficking and other unlawful activities have marred the district and its potential to grow into an economic hub in the country. “Butwal is the temporary provincial capital of Province-5. So, the area is also a highly sensitive area,” said Pantha.","Published at : September 18, 2019",Bhairahawa,Madhav Dhungana
Lack of necessary laws leaves local government helpless,"Owing to the spirit of federalism adopted by the country, with the promulgation of the new constitution in 2015, people expected local governments would function more efficiently. However, the local government—across all provinces—hasn’t been able to deliver on its promises, mainly due to a lack of laws.The constitution has delegated 22 different powers and authorities to the local unit to execute works regarding health, education, agriculture, livestock, social security, development activities, among others. But as various provincial laws are yet to be formulated, the local government has failed to work effectively in various sectors—particularly forest and land management.Butwal, as the headquarters of Province 5, grows by the year with people rapidly migrating into the city—so much so that the market places and the settlement areas have expanded into public land. As per a report prepared by the Butwal Sub-metropolis last year, 16,193 houses have been constructed on public land. The laws of the country do not allow private property to be built on public land and the guilty should be rightfully evicted off the land.However, the Province 5 government is yet to enact the necessary law/s into the matter so far. This absence of law has rendered the local unit incapable of taking action against the encroachers, says Shibaraj Subedi, the mayor of Butwal.“There are innumerable problems at the local level. But we are helpless due to the lack of laws. Only the provincial laws can facilitate us to address such problems. But the province has not formulated the required laws,” he said. According to the Local Government Act 2074 BS, the local unit has authority to manage/evict people who have been staying on the public land in the local body. In a bid to manage rampant encroachment in Butwal, the sub-metropolis collected data of illegal settlers and formed a task force to conserve public land. “But we could not move forward. We could not remove the settlers from the public land since we weren’t equipped to do so without proper laws in place,” said Subedi.Nearly 50 percent of the settlement areas in Devdaha, another municipality of Rupandehi district, is located in a forest area. Major settlements—including Khairahani and Bhawanipur—lie in forests. Charange, a dense settlement, is built entirely on forest land. Most of the market places, mainly along the East-West Highway of Sainamaina municipality lie in the forest area. The local government could neither evict the encroachers nor collect tax from them.“It is the provincial government’s responsibility to formulate acts and policies to conserve the forest. But the province hasn’t done anything about it. We have to bear the brunt of the provincial government’s inefficiency and their inability to have necessary legal provisions in place,” said Chitra Bahadur Karki, the mayor of Sainamaina. The municipality is unable to check rampant encroachment and irregularities in the forest due to the provincial government’s failure to enact laws, he added.Some local units attempted to formulate rules and regulations, but they were not effective enough, said Keshavnanda Baniya, chief of Marchawari Rural Municipality.“We tried implementing some rules and regulations but it didn’t work. Our rules don’t hold the same power as laws do. The federal and provincial governments are not coordinating in regards to laws and policies for the local units—that’s where all the problems arise,” he said.“The local units are unable to execute their works effectively as the federal and provincial governments haven’t formulated various laws. The laws formulated by the local government will be scrapped by default if they contradict with the federal and provincial laws. So the roles of the local government has become meaningless,” said Mahendra Prasad Pandey, an advocate who has expertise on local governance.","Published at : September 17, 2019",Butwal,Amrita Anmol
Bhuri Gaun-Telpani road being upgraded for the first time since it was built,"The 51-km Bhuri Gaun-Telpani road, linking Birendranagar, the provincial capital of Karnali, to Bhuri Gaun in Bardiya in Province 5 was opened some 51 years ago. The road—rarely used by commuters—was primarily used to ferry goods and messages back in the day.As it was rarely used, the road section was never really upgraded since it was opened because the road passes through Bardiya National Park. Disputes between the locals demanding upgradation of the road and park officials refusing construction of a road within the park’s premises had put upgradation works on hold. But six months ago the Apex court gave a verdict on the ongoing disputes allowing the road to be upgraded soon, local authorities say.Ananath Baral, chief conservation officer at the Bardiya National Park, said that the park authorities earlier had concerns about construction work disturbing the park’s wildlife habitat, and therefore, had refused to allow the construction. “But the court has ordered the Department of the Roads to conduct an environmental assessment before upgrading the road, ” said Baral.Once the road stretch is constructed, the Bhuri Gaun-Telpani road, which is unmotorable during the monsoons even for small vehicles, will bring changes to the vicinity, said Hari Bahadur Thapa, a local of Bhuri Gaun. “The road will change the lives of people in Sudurpaschim and Karnali and the western parts of Province 5. Residents of Karnali will be able to easily transport their products to Tarai after the expansion of the road, which will encourage trade between the two provinces,” he said.Once the road comes into operation, it is expected to work as a lifeline for the residents of Sudurpaschim and Karnali provinces. The expected time travel from Bardia to Barahatal, in Karnali, is expected to be reduced to only one hour. Currently, one needs to travel 102 km from Bardia—via Ratna Highway—to reach Birendranagar, which is much closer to Bardiya than Barahatal.Fifty-one years ago, the District Panchayat had opened the road stretch to carry letters and cargoes from Bhuri Gaun in Thakurbaba to Telpani in Barahatal. According to locals, postmen used to carry letters and cargoes from the road section and Karnali locals themselves would make the journey to Bardiya on foot via the open road.“It would take people an entire day to walk from Karnali to Bardiya through the Bhuri Gaun-Telpani road; it’s now going to be the shortest route to connect the three provinces,” said Thapa.According to locals of Bhuri Gaun, the upgradation and full operation of the Bhuri Gaun-Telpani road will also ensure a decrease in the cost of goods and services in the area. Thapa said, “The transportation cost will be lower after traders start using the road section to ferry goods from Province 5. This stands to benefit the locals in the long-run.”The central government has also allocated a Rs 10 million-budget to upgrade the road. Netra Bilash Paudel, an information officer of the Division Road Office in Nepalgunj, said that the government has kept the project on high priority. “The detailed project report for the road project has already been prepared,” said Paudel, adding that the upgradation works will start after the Ministry of Forest grants permission for the construction of the road. According to the Division Road Office, an environmental impact assessment (EIA) has also been conducted for the expansion of the road.","Published at : September 17, 2019",Bardiya,Thakur Singh Tharu
Multiple landslides along Tansen-Butwal section leave passengers in hardship,"Recurring landslides along the 39-km-long Tansen-Butwal road stretch have left hundreds of passengers in hardship.The landslides, triggered by heavy rains, occurred in Siddababa, Kalimati, Kerabari, Chaubismail, Jumsa and Panimill areas for the past three days. The police are currently removing debris, but it is proving to be difficult as landslides are continuously occurring because of constant rainfall in the area, said police. Transportation on the road stretch had been disrupted for about two hours as well because a huge boulder fell on the road at Mathillo Siddababa area on Saturday morning. “The road was blocked as the boulder fell at around 9 am. We resumed transportation after two hours. We don’t know when the landslide will occur again,” said Bal Bahadur Ghartimagar, a police officer at Dobhan Police Post.On Friday, a landslide buried two jeeps in Siddababa area, killing one and injuring four others. According to Ghartimagar, the Tansen-Butwal section of the Siddhartha Highway has already been obstructed twice.Travelling along the section, especially during the rainy season, has been quite risky. “We don’t know when a landslide will occur and disrupt traffic along the road. It is very dangerous to travel along the road in the rainy season,” Bishnu Pandey, a motorcyclist who was stuck in jam after the landslide, told the Post.The Division Road Office in Palpa has suggested people travel along the section only after learning about the condition of the road.The Siddababa area is a highly landslide-prone zone, with landslides disrupting the highway every year. Residents have for long complained that the authorities concerned have not taken concrete initiatives to resolve the problem sustainably.Preparation on to construct tunnel in the areaThe federal government has allocated Rs 500 million to construct a tunnel along the Siddababa area. “A Detailed Project Report (DPR) has been prepared and submitted to the government. Tunnel construction will begin soon,” said Kedar Nepal, chief at the division road office. The DPR suggests constructing 1,124 metres long tunnel in the landslide-prone area.","Published at : September 15, 2019",Palpa,Madhab Aryal
"Six killed in a landslide in Chherlobang, Rolpa","Six people were killed in a landslide at Chherlobang on the Gharti Gaun-Thabang road section along Shahid Marga on Thursday night.The bodies of the deceased were recovered from the incident site on Friday. According to police, the deceased are Shir Kumari Budhamagar, 28; her four-year-old son Asal; Jaya Budhamagar; his wife Muljyoti; and their two daughters (both under two years of age). They were killed after the landslide buried the house they were living in, at Thabang Rural Municipality Ward No. 2, according to police.Laxman Dhakal, chief district officer, said that police retrieved the bodies of the deceased during the rescue operation.The area had witnessed continuous rainfall for the past three days. The landslide occurred on the under-construction Shahid road stretch. Chitra Gurung, deputy superintendent of police, said that all of the bodies were retrieved from the landslide debris. Gurung said, “All of the deceased were taking shelter at Shir Kumari’s house from Thursday noon fearing that their own houses would be swept away by a looming landslide.”The incident site is around 60 kilometres from Libang, the district headquarters of Rolpa. Bir Bahadur Ghartimagar, chairman of the rural municipality, says the incident took place as a result of unsustainable construction of the Shahid road. “The contractor company, Kumar Tamang JV, started construction of the road without conducting a technical survey. This disaster wouldn’t have occurred if the hill was left untouched in the first place,” said Ghartimagar.The Post tried to contact the representatives of the contractor company several times but they were unavailable for comment.The local unit has provided Rs 25,000 (per person) as compensation to the victims' families. Police personnel from Thabang, Gharti Gaun, Kureli, Mirul and Iribang have reached the incident site to conduct the rescue operation.The District Security Committee has decided to send a doctor’s team in the village to conduct a postmortem of the deceased. Vehicular movement along the road has been obstructed after the landslide swept away the road sections at Gharti Gaun, Korchabang, Iribang and Kureli areas. “We have been making preparations to send a team of health workers, including Dr Prakash Bahadur Budha from the district hospital, to conduct the postmortems,” said Dhakal.However, the team of health workers will only reach Chherlobang on Saturday as vehicular movement along the road section has come to a halt due to multiple landslides.","Published at : September 14, 2019",Rolpa,Kashiram Dangi
Hospital management committee demand upgrade of Rolpa District Hospital,"Health workers and the management committee of Rolpa District Hospital have asked the provincial and federal governments to enhance the hospital’s institutional capacity.The hospital management committee has requested the governments to upgrade the health facilities at the hospital. A delegation team led by Raj Bahadur Budhamagar, chief of the District Coordination Committee, is currently in Kathmandu to request the authorities concerned to address their demands.The team reached the Ministry of Health and Population and urged officials to upgrade the 15-bed hospital to a 50-bed health institution. “We have also put forward a demand to deploy specialist doctors in Rolpa,” said Dr Sushal Acharya, chief at the district hospital.The hospital has been operating out of a building that was left incomplete while being constructed some four decades ago. This has severely affected health services at the hospital due to a lack of adequate infrastructure, said Acharya. The hospital currently does not have enough workforce or the necessary equipment to provide quality services. Despite the shortcomings, the health institution is still known to be doing exemplary works. “Rolpa residents are receiving quality health services in the hospital. We don’t have to go out of the district to treat minor diseases,” said Jag Bahadur Oli of Liwang. “The hospital has been providing good health services despite a shortage of staff and resources. We will help the hospital in its bid to provide better services,” said Dr Binod Giri, the health directorate of Province 5. Giri, who had once served in the hospital as its chief, recently monitored the hospital. He pledged that the provincial government will provide the required manpower and equipment to the hospital. “We will work towards upgrading the hospital,” he said.The hospital is currently operating emergency services, X-ray service and laboratory services, and runs a pharmacy and a safe abortion programme. “We are committed to providing as many health services as possible in the hospital,” said Dr Dhanmaya Ghartimagar.Currently, there are four doctors— two appointed on a contract basis, four auxiliary health workers, two staff nurses, a pharmacist and two lab technicians. According to the hospital administration, around 100 patients visit the health facility daily.","Published at : September 13, 2019",Rolpa,Kashiram Dangi
Patients at Lumbini hospital are being treated on the floor,"Ashma Monihar of Mayadevi Rural Municipality in Kapilvastu district delivered a child at Taulihawa Hospital on Monday morning. The following morning on Tuesday, her baby’s health deteriorated and was referred to Lumbini Provincial Hospital in Butwal. When Monihar reached the emergency ward of the hospital, there were no beds available. Her baby was treated on the floor.Maya Yadav of Gangoliya from Tilottama Municipality, who has been bedridden due to high fever for the last seven days, was also taken to the provincial hospital on Tuesday. She, too, was treated on the floor along with several other patients. Lumbini Provincial Hospital receives patients from 12 districts of Province-5 and also from Syangja and Baglung districts of Gandaki Province. The hospital, which receives 1,200 patients in a daily average, has witnessed a rise in the number of patients in the last two weeks, said Dr Krishna Khanal, medical superintendent at the hospital. “The hospital has been receiving 1,500 patients daily. The health workers have been referring patients to other hospitals due to lack of beds here,” he said. According to one hospital official, though the hospital had purchased 100 beds a year ago, they remain unused due to a lack of space. “We have beds but we don’t have space in the hospital. We haven’t opened the new hospital building yet” said Khanal.The provincial government has been planning to upgrade the 135-bed hospital to a 300-bed hospital, but the plan is yet to come to fruition. The hospital also has an ultrasound and an echo machine, but they also remain unused. Ramesh Khanal, former chairman of the hospital, said that medical superintendent and administrator should be responsible for the smooth operation of the hospital. “The medical superintendent and administrator of the hospital are supposed to provide effective health services to the patients. They need to do their jobs well,” he said. Bipin Chhetri, administrative chief of the hospital, admitted to the hospital’s inability to extend full services to patients.“There are 530 employees at the hospital currently. We also have the necessary equipment but haven’t been able to provide full service to the patients. But we are making concrete efforts to reform the hospital and its operations,” he said.","Published at : September 12, 2019",Butwal,Amrita Anmol
Province 5 sets criteria for hospital committee chief’s appointment,"The Province 5 government has set criteria of academic qualification and experience conditions for the appointment of the hospital development committee chief.A cabinet meeting on Monday approved a proposal put forth by the provincial Ministry of Social Development regarding the appointment of the hospital development committee chief of the district and provincial level hospitals. According to the new provision, one should hold at least a Bachelor’s degree from a university recognised by the government of Nepal to be appointed as the chief. Similarly, the candidate should have worked in the government health service sector for at least 10 years or any other health sector for at least five years to be qualified for the post.There are 11 district hospitals and three provincial-level hospitals in Province 5. Due to the lack of necessary legal provisions, the hospitals are being managed by forming a development committee under the chairmanship of the district coordination committee chief.Social Development Minister Sudarshan Baral expressed his hope that the new provision with required qualification and experience a candidate should carry will help resolve the existing problems in government health facilities.“From now on a competent person will lead the hospital. The chief of the hospital development committee needs at least basic qualification to mobilise doctors and other health employees,” said Minister Baral. Until now, party leaders and social campaigners were generally appointed as the chief of the hospital development committee.","Published at : September 3, 2019",Rupandehi,Ghanshyam Gautam
Inside Rolpa district’s quest to go alcohol-free,"Ranasingh Damai left his village of Gharti Gaun in Rolpa for Libang, the district headquarters, after his home was severely affected by the Maoist insurgency. He also left his shop and belongings, worth hundreds of thousands of rupees, fearing action from the insurgents because he didn’t believe in their ideology. Since then, he has been residing in the Libang town and has never returned to his village, out of fear of “punishment” from the rebels.In Libang, he is having a tough time making a living for a family of eight, including six children. “The Maoists didn’t let me collect my belongings,” Damai said. “My problems were neither heeded by the state nor the Maoists when they came into power. We had to flee our home to save our lives.”The responsibility of earning enough to feed a large family started taking a toll on Damai, and he found solace in alcohol. “I know alcohol is bad, but it’s become a friend in need,” said Damai. “I can’t sleep during the night if I don’t drink a glass or two of alcohol.”Alcohol has already created a rift in Damai’s family, and his problems are far from over. “I faced great difficulties when I came to Libang,” he said. “And, those difficulties stayed with me; and I have used alcohol to get over it.”Another local in Libang, Manish, who requested his last name to be withheld for privacy reasons, professes the same addiction to alcohol. Manish runs a small shop in the town and says that he too depends on alcohol for a good night’s sleep. “I got addicted to alcohol when the insurgency was in full swing,” said Manish. “Back then I was perturbed by the war, now by alcohol itself.”Alcohol was banned in Rolpa during the insurgency. Alcoholic beverages were prohibited from being produced and sold. But as the Maoists abandoned arms and the peace process took off, alcohol made a swift comeback in the towns and villages of Rolpa. Thabang, for instance, used to be known as a “communist village” during the insurgency, and there was a blanket ban on alcohol. Under the leadership of Pushpa Kamal Dahal, then commander in chief of the Maoist outfit, the production of ground apple took off in the village, a fruit that is majorly used to produce local beverages. The use of alcohol is rife and on the rise in Thabang and in other villages across the district.“The number of patients suffering from alcohol-related ailments of the heart, respiration and blood pressure is on the rise,” said Kul Bahadur Dangi, a Senior Auxiliary Health Worker at the Rolpa District Hospital. Rolpa imports alcohol products worth Rs 20 million a year, according to data by the Rolpa District Chamber of Commerce.This concerns the local representatives and member of various clubs and Mothers’ Group. As a result, numerous campaigns have been launched in the district, with the local units gearing up to ban alcohol. Local unit representatives say the ban would help maintain peace and societal harmony in the district. And while some campaigns have seen success, not everything has gone as planned. Tribeni Rural Municipality, for instance, has banned the sale of alcoholic beverages during the day. Local representatives have concluded that alcoholism has degenerated societal values, and hence are supervising all seven wards in the municipality, imposing fines for breaching the rules. So far, Rs 500,000 has been collected as fine in the rural municipality. This has significantly reduced the number of alcohol users and incidents of domestic violence are less frequent, according to Shanta Kumar Oli, chief of the rural municipality. Oli said his office is coming up with employment campaigns to engage youths.Other local units such as Sulichaur, Holeri, Gharti Gaun, Saatdobato and Nuwa Gaun have also taken measures to curb alcohol use, and they too haven’t been successful entirely. Most of the people still need to be aware of the negative impacts of alcohol, said Yama Lal Bista, Ward 6 chairman of Lungri Rural Municipality. “Though we have been trying to ban alcohol, it hasn’t been entirely successful,” Bista said. “We need to raise awareness among the people, with stern measures.”Meanwhile, in Tebang village, a ‘mothers’ group’ (or aama samuha) recently brought all the alcohol they had confiscated from an annual carnival in Tebang village to the office of the Sunil Smriti Rural Municipality. They destroyed all the alcohol under the watch of the chief of the municipality and other local representatives. Members of the group took the step after they concluded that alcohol abuse by the local residents was making the villagers corrupt and undisciplined.It’s been about a year since the women belonging to the group have been actively involved in controlling alcohol use among the locals. Other groups of students and teenagers have lent their hand in such endeavours as well, and this has taken the form of a campaign.The campaign has branched out to other local units in the district as well. And a fair number of local representatives have joined their hands with the women to control alcohol use, while a few wards have been declared alcohol-free zones.The women involved in the campaign say that excessive alcohol use has restricted the villagers from coming out of a drunken stupor for the last decade and a half. “This district will be developed only if we control alcoholism,” said Khaumali Ale, chairperson of Chispadhara Mothers’ Group. “The village has degenerated because of alcoholism in men and women. This is why we are dedicated to curb the problem.”The group has also banned the production and sale of alcohol. “This is, by all means, a much-needed step and we have been assisting the members of the mothers’ group,” said Kali Kami, a member of the ward in Tebang village.","Published at : September 1, 2019",Rolpa,Kashiram Dangi
Guthi Sansthan says it is ‘working’ to reclaim the guthi land sold by a priest,"Guthi Sansthan has said it is initiating the necessary legal process to reclaim a piece of land in Siddharthanagar Municipality-6, Rupandehi, which was sold by the priest of Laxmi Narayan Math Guthi of Mahottari, a public guthi. The Sansthan says the property belongs to it, but was illegally transferred under personal ownership of the priest and then sold.Jagannath Das Bainshnav, who has worked as a priest of the Laxmi Narayan Math Guthi since 1997, had sold 3.5 katthas (828.94 square metres) of land to Udayaman Pandey and Sanjaya Prasad Pandey for Rs6.1 million on April 29. [Read: Guthi Sansthan was in dark for years about how its land was being used]The Sansthan on June 16 sought clarification from Jagannath, asking why the land should not again be brought under Laxmi Narayan Math Guthi. Jagannath claimed in response that the land had remained his personal property before he became a priest of the temple in 1997.After the death of his predecessor and father Kishor Das Bainshnav, he assumed the role of priest of the Laxmi Narayan Math Guthi. However, the Sansthan claimed that Jagannath, who is suspended as a priest of the temple over the case, has failed to present any evidence to suggest he owned the property.A probe conducted by the Sansthan also pointed out that the land belongs to the public guthi. Sansthan staff Baburam Poudel concluded in his probe report that the land did belong to the guthi and had been overseen by Jagannath’s father Kishor Das Bainshnav as suggested by the owner of bordering land and documentation (lagat) kept in 1958. As per Clause 143 of the Land Administration Directive, a saint appointed as priest of the public temple can sell the land earned by himself or herself during his lifetime. But the land, which is sold during his or her lifetime comes under the ownership of the guthi, and cannot be sold. As per Clause 144 of the directive, such land cannot be given as a gift.“As per the law, we allowed Jagannath to clarify his position regarding the sold land,” said Narayan Chaudhary, administrator of the Sansthan. “But he has failed to prove he owned the land.”He said that the Sansthan has suspended Jagannath from the post of priest as per its employee-related bylaws and has given dates to furnish clarifications as needed. “There is also space for taking legal action against him for forgery,” he added.The issue came to light after the Sansthan launched a search for its land amid uproar over public land being transferred in the name of individuals in different parts of the country, including Baluwatar, the prime minister’s official residence, under the influence of land mafias.Yadav said that the Sansthan would take a final decision on the Siddharthanagar-based land sold by the priest. In its letter sent on July 21 to the probe commission, the Sansthan has said it is working to bring back this land under the guthi.Jagannath, in his written reply to the Sansthan, said the land had been under his name before a survey was conducted of the land. He has claimed that the land plot cannot come under a guthi or temple just because it is owned by the priest. Chaudhary has called for an investigation on how the government agencies allowed the sale of this land despite a legal provision that prohibits the sale of public land that is under the supervision of a priest. “The District Administration Office had once frozen this land, but it is unclear why and when it that restriction was lifted,” he said. “The land revenue offices should have considered the legal provisions too before allowing the sale of land.”","Published at : August 28, 2019",Kathmandu,Prithvi Man Shrestha
22 doctors resign in Rapti Academy of Health Sciences citing pressure from administration,"Twenty-two doctors of the Rapti Academy of Health Sciences in Dang resigned en masse on Thursday citing undue pressure from Vice-chancellor Dr Sangita Bhandari.According to the doctors, Bhandari misbehaved with them and repeatedly threatened to terminate them. In the resignation letter, the doctors claimed that they were compelled to resign due to physical and mental pressure from the hospital administration. The doctors tendered their resignation to Chancellor, Medical Association, Medical Council, District Administration Office, and Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli through Vice-chancellor Bhandari.Twelve medical specialists and 10 medical officers have resigned from their posts. Since the doctors put in their papers, health services at the hospital have come to a halt. On Friday, locals organised a meeting in Ghorahi to address the problems people are facing since the disruption of services at the hospital. They put forth their concerns to the hospital administration. The meeting decided to start a campaign named “Save Academy Campaign” and the campaigners led by Bikiran Gautam, a rights activist, advised Bhandari to resign from her post immediately for mistreating the hospital employees.Bhandari, however, said that she was only seeking clarification after incidents of patients being referred to private clinics came to her notice. “I have asked doctors to stay within the rule of the academy, but they instead staged protests. All of them should join their posts and resume work,” said Bhandari.Rapti Sub Regional Hospital, the biggest hospital in Rapti zone, was converted into Rapti Academy of Health Sciences in 2018. On February, more than 62 employees of the hospital had staged protests against the mismanagement of the academy for a month, demanding the authorities to provide professional security to staff, proper salary and allowances. The Education and Health Committee of Parliament had then formed a subcommittee to solve the problem. The subcommittee had recommended the government to take action against the representatives of the academy for not working towards solving the issues and problems faced by the academy’s employees.The report prepared by the subcommittee found that the academy lacks various aspects of management and medical assistance largely because of the unilateral decisions taken by the representatives including Vice-chancellor Dr Sangita Bhandari. The subcommittee had also advised the hospital to decrease the treatment fees, resume its health services, adjust the salary scale of the employees as per the designation assigned to them, and to address the demands of the agitating employees.","Published at : August 24, 2019",Dang,Durgalal KC
Budget for road project released before work completion,"If paperwork is anything to go by, the Juguniya-Birnagar Road Upgradation Project in Bijayanagar completed in the last fiscal year. The contractor received the final instalment of the budget before July after completion of the work. However, road upgradation work is still ongoing along the road stretch.The locals claim that the upgradation work has not only been delayed, but it has also been substandard. “The road is almost the same as it was before. The contractor just spread 8-10 trolleys of sand and pebble in the name of road upgradation,” said Govardan Yadav, a local. The locals expressed their dissatisfaction with the elected representatives, stating that they have failed to ensure timely completion of work. They blame the representatives for protecting the contractor. The Rs 5 five million contract of upgrading the Juguniya-Birnagar Road was awarded to Amar Construction Service. According to the agreement, the construction company has to gravel the road and construct six culverts along the road section.The locals say the contractor, following a protest from the villagers, laid sand and pebble in some parts of the road in the name of construction.“Hume pipes have been laid in six places to make the culvert, but the work is yet to complete,” said Yadav.The disgruntled locals also complained that they were unaware of the contract and budget allocation of the project. “There are no boards or signages that mention the project. When we went to the rural municipal office, nobody answered our queries regarding the project,” said Rajendra Yadav, another local. Pradip Kumar Chaudhary, an engineer at the local unit, admitted of issuing the budget without completing the work. “The local unit issued the budget after preparing the necessary paperwork by the end of the last fiscal year,” Chaudhary said.Refuting the locals’ claims that the construction work is still ongoing, he said, “The work continued until mid-August. It is now complete.” Rabindra Prasad Chaudhary, the chief administrative officer of the local body, said that the budget was released in the last fiscal year after officials from the rural municipality monitored the project. “But the work continued till mid-August,” he said.Employees at the local body said they tried to stop the budget allocation before the work completion but in vain. They said the elected representatives put pressure on them to do so.When the Post tried to reach the local unit’s Deputy Chief Laxmi Chaudhary, she refused to comment.","Published at : August 24, 2019",Kapilvastu,Manoj Paudel
Flood-damaged border pillars yet to be reconstructed,"The government authorities are yet to erect five boundary pillars along the Nepal-India border that had collapsed in floods last month.Fearing possible border disputes, the locals worry that the collapsed border pillars might gradually be swept away. “The collapsed pillars will be swept away if the stream gets flooded again. Nobody from the government has visited the area to reconstruct the pillars,” said Rajendra Yadav, a local. The floods on July 13 damaged five border pillars in the local streams at Bijayanagar Rural Municipality of Kapilvastu. Floodwaters from the Chirai stream in Bijayanagar had damaged four pillars that separate Thakurapur of Nepal and Balarampur of India. Dinesh Chaudhary, ward chairman of Bijayanagar-7, said four pillars numbered 577/7, 577/9, 578/7 and 578/10 were damaged by the floods.“Pillar number 577/7 has completely submerged into water,” said Police Constable Parashuram Yadav.Security agencies and the local administration had inspected the collapsed pillars last month but are yet to take any initiatives for their reconstruction.Suman Nepal, inspector at the Area Police Office in Ganeshpur, said the unit has already informed the police headquarters in Kathmandu about the issue. “The locals are demanding for the damaged pillars to be reconstructed soon,” Nepal sai. According to Nepal, two other border pillars numbered 578/3 and 578/6 are also on the verge of collapse. On Wednesday, the local administration was informed that two other boundary pillars were also damaged at Chamar forest of Bijayanagar. “One pillar has been buried while another has lost its upper half,” said Narayan Prasad Timilsina, a forest guard.The pillars, which were constructed this year, were built weak to begin with, according to locals. “The pillars’ foundations were hardly half-metre wide. As a result, they couldn’t survive last month’s floods,” said Chaudhary.","Published at : August 20, 2019",Kapilvastu,Manoj Paudel
Bardiya National Park takes aid of mobile app for rhino conservation,"Bardiya National Park has started using a mobile app for the conservation of one-horned rhinos.According to park officials, the app will help receive vital information about rhinos, including their photographs by using smart mobile phones. It has been named “smart patrol”.In the past, the park used the satellite-GPS collar on the rhinos in the Babai valley to enhance the monitoring of the endangered animals. But that technology is useless now. After this satellite-based technology stopped working properly, park officials have introduced the new technology (mobile app) to track rhinos in the jungle and also to study their behaviour and habits.Ananath Baral, chief conservation officer of the park, said that satellite-GPS collars are not working on the rhinos in the Babai valley these days. “The satellite-GPS collars do not provide information now. They might have been damaged or lost,” said Baral, adding that the details will be known after they start a census of the animals this fiscal year.More than 18 rhinos were killed by poachers in the Babai valley during war-era. The Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation, National Trust for Nature Conservation, WWF Nepal and local communities were involved in satellite tracking of endangered wildlife, including rhinos and tigers in the park.In 2016 and 2017, eight rhinos which were translocated from Chitwan National Park to Bardiya National Park, were successfully collared with radio transmitters. As per the record of the park, there are only six rhinos in the Babai valley. One of the rhinos died of natural causes, said Baral.Laxmiraj Joshi, assistant conservation officer of the National Trust for Nature Conservation, said that the new technology has been adopted for rhino conservation. “The satellite-GPS collars will only last for two years,” said Joshi, adding they have started to use mobile app for the monitoring of rhinos.A number of video cameras have been installed in various parts of the park for the security of rhinos in Karnali river area. The number of rhinos has reached 37 in the park over a decade.According to the 2015 count, Nepal is home to 645 rhinos—605 in Chitwan, 29 in Bardia National Park, eight in Shuklaphanta National Park, and three in Parsa National Park. The number of rhinos, which fell sharply in the 1950s and 60s, started to rebound after the establishment of the Chitwan sanctuary in 1973.","Published at : August 17, 2019",Bardiya,Thakur Singh Tharu
Bhairahawa is getting a multi-billion-rupee airport. But will tourists spend time in the city?,"The opening of the Gautam Buddha International Airport in Bhairahawa, slated for March next year at the latest, is expected to provide a much-needed leg-up to Visit Nepal 2020. But the private sector in this southern city is not sure how much the city can benefit from the new airport and the government’s tourism push.“Siddharthanagar Municipality is still preparing for the tourist inflow through the international airport,” said Kul Prasad Neupane, chairperson of the Siddharthanagar Chamber of Commerce and Industry. “But we still have some time before tourists begin to arrive through this airport.” Although Bhairahawa’s name was officially changed to Siddharthanagar, it is still widely referred to by its old name.The Gautam Buddha International Airport was supposed to be completed in 2017, but two years later, it is still under construction, with just four months remaining until the new year begins. Tourism Minister Yogesh Bhattarai, who has been in office for less than a month, has pledged completion by December or March. Even after opening, it will take time for international flights to land.Although the new airport was envisioned to help kickstart tourism in the industrial city of Bhairahawa, tourism entrepreneurs are afraid that there’s just not much for tourists to do here.“The private sector is prepared but we cannot hold the tourists here for a longer stay,” said Sanjay Bajimaya, CEO of Nepa: Travels & Tours.Although Bhairahawa is the gateway to one of Nepal’s most prized tourism landmarks— Lumbini, the birthplace of Lord Buddha—the city cannot hold tourists for longer than a day. This is largely because Bhairahawa is an industrial city with little emphasis given to tourism over the years. The local businesses here were working with the pull and push strategy—bring in tourists and send them to other popular destinations such as Palpa, Chitwan and Pokhara—for more than 30 years, according to Bajimaya. Since the tourists have no reason to stay in the city for more than a day, spaces and cultural shows that could have been utilised for tourism are yet to be developed. As of now, one of the only—and the biggest—highlights for high-spending tourists in the city is a five-star casino resort that opened in 2017. But the 100-room property, which includes two villas, a gym, spa, swimming pool, restaurants and banquet facilities suitable for weddings, has failed to generate the kind of revenue it expected. The Tiger Palace Resort in Bhairahawa. The 100-room property is the first integrated five-star casino resort in South Asia. Photo Courtesy: Tiger PalaceFor Nepali tourists, the only significance Bhairahawa has is its famous peda from Pawan Misthan Bhandar located in the central market. Other spaces close to Bhairahawa such as the ostrich farm in Tilottama Municipality and Manimukunda Sen Park in Butwal have never been advertised, and often go unvisited.For years, tourists who arrived in the city have seen Bhairahawa as a transit point before they make their way to other popular tourist destinations or cross the border and enter India.For tourists who come to Nepal to experience the cultures and lifestyles of this diverse country, Bhairahawa can end up a big disappointment, Bajimaya said. According to him, while the district of Rupandehi is busy building luxury hotels and restaurants to cater to tourists, Bhairahawa, Rupandehi’s biggest city and its administrative headquarters, lacks a representative display of culture, heritage and food of the people from this region. Although travel agencies and local businesses have been urging Rupandehi locals to invest in homestays instead of luxury hotels, no homestays have so far been registered in the district.“We don’t have cultural shows here,” Bajimaya said. “The market closes early and there is practically nothing for visitors to do in the evening.”Tourism entrepreneurs like Bajimaya blame the open border with India, which is just six kilometres from Bhairahawa, for the city’s failure to develop proper tourism infrastructure. Since the border remains open till 10 pm, most visitors prefer to enter India after a day in the city or go to Sonauli to get goods from there at a cheaper price.According to Bajimaya, it is essential for the Bhairahawa market to also open until 10 pm if the tourism sector is to expand. With the airport opening and Nepal’s plans to welcome two million tourists for Visit Nepal 2020, Bhairahawa needs a night market if it is to hold on to visitors overnight.However, for city authorities, this is a chicken-or-egg problem. While tourism entrepreneurs say that a night market will bring in more overnight tourists, the administration says that it will only consider a night market if more tourists stay overnight.“A night market might be a possibility if the number of tourists who stay in Bhairahawa overnight increases,” said Khyam Bahadur Thapa, the chief administrative officer of Siddharthanagar Municipality.According to Thapa, there are already multiple projects in Bhairahawa that are targeted towards bringing in—and keeping—tourists.One of such projects is the Danda corridor, a planned 14 km long stretch that will include elements of biodiversity conservation, agriculture and recreation. The recreation portion of the corridor will be 4.5 km long and will run alongside the Danda river, starting from Danda pool and ending near Bhairahawa Multiple Campus. The corridor will be lined with artwork that tells the life story of the Buddha along with Buddhist music. The corridor, however, will take at least two more years to complete, according to Thapa.While five statues of the Buddha have been installed along the six-lane Bhairahawa-Butwal highway, there are plans to install more.“We are adding elements related to the Buddha in the city because that is what tourists come here for,” said Thapa.With just months remaining for Visit Nepal 2020, building new tourism infrastructure in Bhairahawa may not be useful, as the projects will likely not complete by 2020. However, with the international airport expected to take some of the load off Kathmandu’s heavily-trafficked Tribhuvan International Airport, investments in tourism and infrastructure in Bhairahawa would be a smart move in the long run, Neupane said.“We are having a hard time sustaining existing tourism businesses right now,” said Bajimaya. “But once the airport comes into full operation and if the government brings in new plans, the tourism sector will surely take a new turn.”","Published at : August 17, 2019",Bhairahawa,Arya Mainali
Construction of cobblestone path around Jagadishpur Lake raises concern of biodiversity loss,"The Department of Tourism has started to construct a path around Jagadishpur Lake in Kapilvastu in order to boost tourism activities.  The construction project, however, was approved without conducting an environmental impact assessment (EIA), according to Badganga Irrigation Division Office. The contract was issued by the Department of Tourism to Kalpabriksya/Jalukeni JV Kathmandu and the work began on July 6. Ram Krishna Ghorasaine, chief of the irrigation division office, said that the Department of Tourism and the contractor company failed to coordinate with the division before starting the construction works.“No infrastructure can be constructed in the lake area without the EIA study. But the contractor company has begun constructing the cobblestone path around the lake,” said Ghorasaine.  Besides constructing the path around the lake, Kalpabriksya/Jalukeni JV Kathmandu has also agreed to build a park in the area. The project is set to be completed by October 2020.  In August 2003, the lake, which is home to many bird species, was recognised as a Ramsar wetland site. The lake, which is spread over an area of 157 hectares, lies 11km north of Taulihawa, the headquarters of Kapilvastu district.The lake also falls under the jurisdiction of the Department of National Park and Wildlife Conservation. But the Division Forest Office in Kapilvastu has remained silent regarding the construction work in the lake area. “No work can be done in Ramsar wetland site without conducting environment assessment,” said Bishnu Prasad Shrestha, under secretary of the Department of National Park and Wildlife Conservation. “I will inquire about the details of the construction work with district officials.”  According to conservationists, the path is being constructed 2.5 meters down the service road.  “The proximity of the path to the lake will disturb wildlife habitat such as the birds that nest in the lake area,” said Dinesh Giri, an ornithologist.  Another ornithologist Hem Sagar Baral said that infrastructures should not disturb biodiversity.  “This area houses several species of birds, and their well-being and protection must be kept in mind before initiating any construction work in the area,” said Baral.  However, Shiva Bahadur Wagle, local ward chairman, has a different view regarding the construction of path and park at the Ramsar wetland site.  “This is a positive move. Beautification of the area will attract tourists which will help locals generate income. The place is a destination for bird-watching enthusiasts. Its tourism potential must be utilised,” he said. Lalit Gurung, chairman of the Jagadishpur Lake Management Forum, also claimed that building a path around the lake will not affect the lake’s biodiversity.  “We should not miss a chance to develop the lake into a major tourist destination of Province 5,” Gurung said. According to conservationists, of the 872 bird species found in Nepal, more than 164, including grebes, cormorants, herons, egrets, stork, ducks and geese, terns and gulls, are found in the lake. Birds migrate to this lake from Siberia, China, Russia, Mongolia, Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan with the start of the winter and they stay here until February. More than 22,000 birds including Gadwall, Lesser Whistling duck, Tufted duck, Ferruginous duck, Northern pintail, Northern shoveler, Eurasian Wigeon, Common Pochard, and Cotton Pygmy-goose are found in the Jagadishpur lake.","Published at : August 15, 2019",Kapilvastu,Manoj Paudel
Province 5 creates is own Provincial Public Service Commission,"Amid ongoing controversy over Public Service Commission’s hiring of staff for the local level, the Province 5 government has taken a major step towards recruiting staff on its own. The Province 5 has created its Provincial Public Service Commission and appointed Dilaram Bhattarai as its chairman. The move means the provincial government can hire staff for the province and local units on its own. Ramesh Pokharel, chief of the High Court in Dang, administered the oath of office to Bhattarai on Tuesday. “Bhattarai has been appointed for a six-year term. The other two members of the commission are yet to be appointed,” said Yamkanta Pandya, information officer at the Chief Minister’s Office of Province 5.Meanwhile, officials at both the federal and provincial governments have said that the provincial public service commission still has a long way to go before it starts recruiting staff, because the Federal Civil Service Act and Provincial Civil Service Act are yet to be introduced. “Provincial public service commissions cannot recruit staff for provinces and local bodies until the duties and facilities of the employees are clear,” said Kiran Raj Sharma, spokesperson for the Federal Public Service Commission. “For this, the Provincial Civil Service Act determines the conditions of services for employees to be recruited by the provincial commission.” Likewise, the Local Service Act will be necessary to recruit staff at the local level. But before these laws are introduced, the Federal Civil Service Act should be passed. The House of Representatives is yet to endorse the bill on Federal Civil Service Act, though it was registered at the parliamentary secretariat on February 10. Without public service commissions, provincial governments and local units across the country are reeling under staff shortage. To address the issue, the federal government had asked the Federal Public Service Commission to start the process to recruit staff in 515 local units, saying that the provinces were yet to create their own public service commissions. The vacancies announced by the Public Service Commission to hire staff at the local and provincial levels, however, have drawn ire from various ethnicities and groups, who say the vacancies do not honour the policy of inclusion and reservation.The provincial governments have also criticised the federal government’s move. They are of the view that as per Article 227 of the Constitution, matters related to employees and offices of the village councils and municipalities are dealt with as per provincial laws.The federal Public Service Commission went ahead with its vacancy notice, citing Section 12 (5 and 6) of the Employees Adjustment Act, which states that the federal government can request the Public Service Commission to start the recruitment process for filling the vacant posts until provincial public service commissions are formed.The provincial governments have blamed the delay on the part of the federal government for the roadblock in staff recruitment. While Province 5 has formed its public service commission, six other provinces are still in the lawmaking stage to form their respective commissions. The Province 2 Assembly recently passed a bill paving the way for the formation of the provincial public service commission. “But the process to appoint the commission’s office-bearers has not yet begun,” said Komal Bahadur Khatri, secretary at Chief Minister’s Office of Province 2. He said that the provincial government would expedite the recruitment process once other related laws are introduced.The Karnali Province Assembly had passed the bill on forming the commission long ago. But Keshav Prasad Upadhyay, spokesperson at the Chief Minister’ Office, said no move has been taken so far to appoint the office-bearers.Province 3 and Gandaki Province appear to be much slower in making laws regarding the commissions. Province 3 Principal Secretary Anandaraj Dhakal said the provincial government was preparing to register a bill on forming public service commission within the third week of August. Gandaki Province, which recently registered a bill on the formation of public service commission, also does not seem to be in a rush. “Firstly, the federal parliament should pass the Federal Civil Service Act to pave the way for introducing Provincial Civil Service Act and Local Service Act,” said Hari Basyal, principal secretary of Gandaki Province. “It will not take much time for the formation of commission at the provincial level once other necessary laws are in place.”","Published at : August 14, 2019",Kathmandu,Prithvi Man Shrestha
"Gulmi village at high risk of landslides, say geologists","On July 23, a massive landslide had struck Thulolumpek Village in Satyadevi Rural Municipality, killing five persons and displacing 371 people. Nearly two weeks after the incident, geologists say the village in Gulmi district still remains at high risk of landslides.A team of geologists from the Department of Mines and Geology on Friday reached the village to study its topography and concluded that the settlement will be at constant threat of landslides in the future as well.Geologists Rajendra Acharya and Sulav Kayastha reached the incident site on Friday and studied the topography of the area.“The village sits on land made of weak rock and soil, which makes it highly likely for landslides to occur even during mild rains,” said geologist Rajendra Acharya. “The people in the village need to be rehabilitated.”Acharya, along with geologist Sulav Kayastha, studied the topography of Pallokhola, Gejakot and Kasingthala in Thulolumpek for three days. Multiple landslides killed 13 people at wards 3 and 4 of Satyadevi Rural Municipality. According to Sudarshan Baral, social development minister of Province 5, landslides wiped out 21 homes and damaged 21 others, displacing 1,260 people at various settlements in the municipality. “All three government levels have been working to rehabilitate the displaced people,” said Baral.

Local units take initiatives to manage stray animals,"Local units in Dang have taken initiatives to manage stray animals, mainly cattle, after receiving complaints of the strays causing road accidents.Ghorahi Sub-metropolitan City has come up with a plan to manage the stray animals and keep them in a forest area in Chaklighat. “Stray animals have become a huge problem for us. They are left loose on the streets which causes traffic snarls and road accidents,” said Mayor Narulal Chaudhary. “These animals have been taken to Chaklighat and will be kept in a temporary structure for now,” According to him, Chaklighat is some distance away from human settlements and has enough pasture land for the strays’ survival. “We will soon set up a Gaushala (cow shed) to manage the stray animals,” said Chaudhary. He plans to keep the animals in a shed and use their milk, urine and dung for commercial purpose.On Tuesday, the sub-metropolis took around 100 stray animals under control and transported them to Chaklighat. Similarly, Tulsipur Sub-metropolis has also started managing stray animals. The local unit recently handed over 125 strays to Tulasi Cattle Conservation Cooperative. The metropolis has provided around 2 bighas and 18 katthas of land to the cooperative on lease for 20 years to build cowsheds for the strays, according to Pandey.Meanwhile, Babai, Dangisharan and Gadhawa rural municipalities in Dang have already built animal sheds to manage stray animals.","Published at : August 7, 2019",Dang,Durgalal KC
"Human traffickers, in a change of tricks, are now waiting across the border","On Saturday, two Nepali girls, both 17, were on their way to Bahraich in India’s Uttar Pradesh, when they were stopped at the border town of Jamunaha for a routine police check. The girls said they were going to observe the annual Bahraich Mela, but upon further questioning, they said that they were going to meet some men across the border. These men, the police discovered, were human traffickers, who had lured these girls with promises of a job.Thousands of Nepalis cross the open border into India every day. Many work across the border while others go to shop for daily necessities and higher-end products that might not be available on the Nepal side. But the Nepal-India border is also notorious for the trafficking of young women.“All too frequently, these innocent Nepali girls fall into traps of human traffickers,” said Keshav Koirala, Nepalgunj coordinator of Maiti Nepal, the anti-trafficking organisation. “Many say they are going for shopping but the truth turns out to be otherwise.”Maiti Nepal, along with a number of other anti-trafficking organisations, routinely stops and questions young women crossing the border with the help of police. But these organisations face a dilemma.“If we prevent them from crossing the border, it would be a violation of their human rights,” said Koirala. “But if we let them go, there is the risk of them being trafficked.”Ever since the Nepal Police stepped up anti-trafficking efforts on this side of the border, human traffickers have adopted a different tactic. Now, they lure women into India with promises of lucrative jobs and higher education, said Koirala. The traffickers meet the women across the border and then spirit them away to the cities, where they are sold into sexual slavery. Many women cross the border and never return, say police.Koirala told the Post of one such teenager who attempted to cross the border recently by herself.“At first, she said she was going to shop for vegetables but after extended interrogation, she revealed that she was running away from her family to meet some men across the border,” said Koirala. “We made her return home.”Traffickers take advantage of the fact that most Nepalis depend on Indian border towns for many of their daily essentials, everything from sundries to groceries.According to data from Maiti Nepal, a total of 920 women were found to have travelled “suspiciously” to India in 2018. Of them, 27 were from the Nepalgunj Sub-metropolitan City and over a hundred from the neighbouring municipalities of Baijanath, Khajura, Kohalpur and Duduwa.A lucrative market for seasonal labour migration has now opened in Shimla, picking apples, said Maiti Nepal’s Koirala, but on their way there, many Nepali women fall victim to traffickers.“Maiti Nepal, in coordination with the police, has been trying really hard to prevent such incidents by making the enquiry processes more rigorous,” Koirala said. “But despite our measures, it’s hard to prevent the girls in the bordering areas from being trafficked.”In tested fashion, traffickers exploit the ambition of young girls, promising them money and a better education, according to Nirmala Thapa, an officer with Shakti Nepal, another anti-trafficking organisation. Because they are young and naive, most are easily sold on these promises. In many cases, the traffickers are the victim’s relatives and their lovers. “The traffickers weave stories targeting the young girls’ fragile minds. This week, we found out that a 20-year-old was promised a marketing job in Dang but was taken to Nepalgunj,” said Thapa. The implication here is that she was going to be trafficked across the border. Just last week, Shakti Nepal rescued five Nepali teenage girls from a brothel in India. Two were from families affected by the 2015 earthquake in Nuwakot and Sindhupalchok, said Thapa. Despite decades of working along the border region and conducting countless awareness campaigns, results have not been all that positive, said Thapa. “It’s very hard to detain traffickers,” she said. “Even if we locate the perpetrators, it’s hard to bring them to book because of their political clout. Often, the police do not want to register such cases.”The city of Nepalgunj, in coordination with Sathi, will soon be putting up information centres at the border crossing where women will need to provide detailed answers to where they are coming from, where they are travelling to, and for what purpose, according to Uma Thapa, Nepalgunj deputy mayor.“The only option seems to be to regulate the border,” Thapa said. “Along with more rigorous awareness programmes, we need to make crossing the open border stricter.” ***What do you think?Dear reader, we’d like to hear from you.

"Once a blessing for the region, the Tinau is gradually turning into a curse","About four years ago, a flash flood on the Tinau river engulfed a settlement of 14 homes and swept away a suspension bridge along the Butwal-Devinagar road stretch. The homes were all made of bamboo and mud in the village of Kadaghari and though there was no human casualty, the families were forced to move. Despite being displaced, the residents returned to the same settlement and built makeshift houses once the monsoon ended.The settlement had been established along the old course of the river, which it had abandoned. The Tinau’s water density lessens significantly during the winter and autumn but suddenly increases during the monsoon. The settlement is established every winter, when the river’s flow is weak. “We don’t have any land we can call our own,” said Raju Nepali, one of the residents who returned to Kadaghari. “It’s not that we want to come back to the flooded area. We are compelled to move back and forth unless the government provides us with a viable alternative.”For those with no land of their own, the river’s banks, which are public land, can be settled without paying any rent. This is why the banks and abandoned courses of the river are filled with squatter communities.Like Kadaghari, over a dozen other places in and along the river—Buddhanagar, Top Majuwa, and Sundarnagar with the highest density—are currently occupied by squatter communities. According to the Butwal Submetropolis, over 4,000 people are currently living as squatters in and along the Tinau. Only this year, 250 more makeshift structures were added to the settlement’s one single ward.Butwal, however, has been aiding the settlements. Instead of finding a long-term solution, city officials have been supplying the settlement with electricity and water. So what started with a few homes on the banks of the river has over the years expanded to block the very course of the river. What was once a long, wide river flows like a canal—narrow and deep—today.Water experts say that the Tinau needs a 237-metre-wide space if the river is to be contained into its usual course during the monsoon, when it gets flooded with water from the Chure range. But today, the river’s course is hardly 50 metres wide.“This means that the settlements along the Tinau will get flooded, perennially,” said Khet Raj Dahal, a research engineer who has been studying the river. “The river has already been shrunk to such an extent that it has absolutely no other option than to engulf the settlements.”The Tinau starts from Madi and Kachal in Palpa district. By the time it gets to Butwal, over 30 small tributaries mix into it. The river divides into two from Madhyabazaar, after it flows for three kilometres inside Butwal. Per second flow of water in the river is 4,000 cubic metres.Over the years, there have been some efforts to prevent flooding. The People’s Embankment Programme, launched by the government in 2009, has already spent over Rs 15 million constructing embankment to prevent the Top Majuwa settlement from being swallowed by floods every year.The programme has invested about Rs 550 million for river management in the last decade. According to data from the municipal office, local councils have invested an additional Rs 50 million. About 15 kilometres across the river, there are concrete walls and embankments. But despite all these efforts, the river has not stopped wreaking havoc. Children play on the bank of Tinau River.  Amrita Anmol /TKP“The only option is to relocate the squatter settlements,” said Yubaraj Kandel, an independent researcher and Professor of Environment Conservation at Kalika Campus. “To complain about the flood when you made the decision to build a house along a river’s course is categorically wrong. Unless the settlements are relocated, any amount of investment will not lead to a sustainable solution.”Bharat Sapkota, an engineer who previously worked at the People’s Embankment Programme, said that the embankments were built as ordered by the sub-metropolitan office to prevent floods. “Embankments obviously shrink the river’s course, but we had no choice,” said Sapkota. At several places, the river has already destroyed the embankments. The Tinau is a major source of construction material and irrigation for Rupandehi district. But in the past two decades, due to unregulated excavation and human encroachment, the Tinau has been deteriorating.“The Tinau river could have become a blessing for Rupandehi,” said Rabindra Gopal Lakaul, chairperson of the Batauli Conservation Committee, “but instead, it has become a curse.”In the past fiscal year, around 83,300 cubic metres of gravel and boulders were excavated from the river. This has led the river to flow deeper than usual. That’s why there has been no significant flooding in the past three years. But some officials complain that local level authorities and police have paid no attention to the illegal excavations.“The flood from Chure is unpredictable and wild,” Sapkota said. “There may come a day when the river floods so badly that it will engulf not just the squatter community but the whole city of Butwal.”Butwal Mayor Shivaraj Subedi said that his office has started surveying and collecting data of all illegal settlements. In the submetropolis, a total of 16,193 homes have been built on public land. Of those, about 50 percent have been built by encroaching on the Tinau or Danab, another river which divides from the Tinau.Subedi said that the city will come up with a plan to solve the crisis once it completes the survey. “This is not the problem of just two or four households,” he said. “The city alone can’t solve this crisis. We will coordinate with the provincial government and will discuss possible solutions.” Over the decades, the Tinau has flooded several times, killing hundreds of people in 1961, 1970, 1981, 1993, 2002 and 2008. The worst flood was in 1970, when over a hundred lives were lost, hundreds of homes swept away and thousands of hectares of arable land destroyed.Lakaul said that there have been too many rash decisions concerning the Tinau and if they continue, there will be an unconscionable tragedy. “Today, the Tinau has been robbed by the people,” he said. “There will come a day when the river will rob the people.”***What do you think?Dear reader, we’d like to hear from you.

Conservationists elated with thriving population of critically endangered White-rumped vulture,"At least 75 nests of the critically endangered White-rumped vulture, locally known as Dangar Gidda, were spotted in Kapilvastu district in the last fiscal year, according to conservation officials at Bird Conservation Nepal.The scavenging bird species were found nesting in various community and leasehold forests of Banganga and Buddhabhumi municipalities.According to Krishna Prasad Bhusal, a vulture conservation official, various vulture species made 309 nests across the districts of Province 5, a major vulture habitat in the country, in the fiscal year 2018-19.“We spotted 75 nests of the White-rumped vulture in Kapilvastu, 83 in Dang, 45 in Rupandehi, 24 in Palpa and 22 in Arghakhanchi,” Bhusal said.Similarly, 60 nests of Red-headed vulture (Sun Giddha), Himalayan Griffon, Egyptian Vulture (Seto Giddha), Slender-billed vulture (Sano Khairo Giddha) and Lammergeier were discovered in Province 5.“It’s an encouraging news for conservationists to find such large numbers of White-rumped vulture’s nests in Kapilvastu and Dang,” said Som GC, an ornithologist, who added that the population of the critically endangered species is gradually increasing in the country in recent years.According to him, about 60 to 70 percent of vulture pairs that laid eggs were successful in nursing their fledglings. “To conserve these vultures, we have to protect their habitats,” he said.The White-rumped vulture is the smallest among the nine vulture species found in Nepal. Its population dwindled during the 1990s. Several researches found that the use of Diclofenac, an anti-inflammatory drug used in treating livestock, was one of the main reasons behind the dwindling population. Studies have found that vultures feeding on carcasses of livestock treated with the drug suffer kidney failure and die within a few days.The population of the White-rumped vulture has been gradually increasing after the government banned the production, sale and use of the drug in 2006.According to vulture conservation official Bhusal, there were around 150 nests of the White-rumped vulture across the country in 2010. This number rose to 397 by 2019. The estimated number of the White-rumped vulture is 2,000 across the country.Conservationists say vultures are helpful in containing outbreaks of cholera, rabies, plague, anthrax and other diseases, as they feed on putrid carcasses that could spread pathogens.“Vultures are not only natural cleaners, they are also crucial in maintaining the food chain balance,” said GC.People living near vulture habitats now understand the importance of vultures to their surroundings, and are therefore aware of the need for their conservation. “Vultures were considered as a bad omen in the past. But now we all know that these birds play a very important role in nature balance,” said Udaya Bahadur Tharu, a villager who lives near Rajapani Community Forest in Kapilvastu.Generally, vultures build nests in tall trees like Sal and Simal. Some species also nest in high cliffs. Conservationist Ishwori Prasad Chaudhary said that these birds lay their eggs between the last week of December and the first week of January. “Vulture eggs begin hatching from mid-February,” said Chaudhary.  ***What do you think?Dear reader, we’d like to hear from you.

Badi women can’t detach themselves from social stigma,"Rajani Badi, a resident of Anantapur, is an elected member of Rajapur Municipality-4 in Bardiya. Her happiness knew no bounds when she got elected as the people’s representative during the local election of 2017. She vowed to work for the welfare of her community and to help women shed the burden of their history. Soon after the election, the ward office had flaunted a brand new signboard on its premises with the names and contact numbers of all its representatives. Rajani took pride in her name being listed out on the board alongside her contemporaries; however, she was soon at the receiving end of unwarranted calls to her number. “Strange men kept calling me from unknown numbers. They asked for sexual favours or at least hinted at a possible sexual encounter,” said Rajani. “After reading my name on the board, they assumed that I would be open to physical intimacy. They offered me money to have sexual relationships with them.” These phone calls were so disturbing that Rajani stopped going to the ward office for days. “The men said that since I’m a Badi woman I shouldn’t hesitate to fall back on the profession of my ancestors. I felt humiliated,” she said. “ I was unable to bring the guilty persons to book fearing social stigma.”Rajani, like many other women from her community, feels that the society hasn’t allowed the young Badi generation to move forward, pulling them back to the profession they were infamous for throughout Nepal’s history. Badis are one of the country’s most deprived and marginalised people, most of whom are poor and landless. Traditionally, Badi men worked as entertainers while the women resorted to prostitution to make a livelihood. Though the new generation of Badi people have found other means of livelihood, they are still struggling to erase the stigma that has been attached to their community.“I, as an elected representative of the people, am forced to endure such humiliation. One can easily understand the situation of ordinary members of our community,” said Rajani. The Badi community bemoan the disadvantages they have to live with and the hurdles they have to overcome to achieve self-respect in society. They argue that the country has undergone many socio-political changes but their plight remains the same. “The society hardly thinks of the Badi community and when it does, we are always linked to prostituion. I am even scared to talk to the media now since it has always depicted the Badi community as “sex workers”. You have to stop it. Our children and the future generation deserves better,” said Manju Badi, executive member of Nepalgunj Sub-metropolis. Rama Badi, an activist advocating for the rights of the Badi people, believes that their struggle has bore some fruits in that most Badi women are now completely out of the profession. “There are some Badi women who are still forced to stay in India and engage in prostitution. These women do not have the education or the skill set to make a living,” Rama said. However, she argued that the Badi people have failed to build on their capacity and make a new start because the society does not recognise their presence.According to the national census conducted in 2011, there are 38,603 Badis living across the country—less than one percent of Nepal’s total population. The Badi settlements are spread across the districts in the mid-western region, primarily in Kailali, Bardia, Banke, Surkhet, Bajhang, Salyan and Dang.***What do you think?Dear reader, we’d like to hear from you.

Susta locals break Gandak canal’s wall to drain floodwaters,"Locals of Mahalbari in Susta Rural Municipality, Nawalparasi, on Wednesday breached a part of Gandak canal’s wall to drain the rainwater that had flooded their settlements and paddy fields.Prem Chandra Gupta, a local, said the villagers were relieved after rainwater receded in the settlement following the canal wall breach. “Our village faces the risk of inundation every monsoon. Until the authorities find a permanent solution, breaching the canal is the only way to save our village from rainwater,” Gupta said. The locals had breached the canal’s wall in 2000 as well. Post the breach, Indian authorities had installed four hume pipes as outlets for floodwaters. However, the pipes are not enough to hold the floodwaters during heavy rains. According to Gupta, heavy monsoon rains inundated around 4,000 hectares of paddy fields at the municipality in the past few days. “The canal’s walls are built on an elevated land because of which rainwater pools in the Nepali side, flooding nearby settlements and farms,” said Gupta. Shambhu Prasad Marasini, the chief district officer of Nawalparasi (West), said rainwaters flood the settlements every year since there is no proper infrastructure to direct the flow of water southwards. “I will inform my Indian counterpart about the problem,” he said.The Gandak canal is a joint irrigation and power project between Nepal and India. A dam was constructed to channelise around 18,000 cusec water through this canal.  ***What do you think?Dear reader, we’d like to hear from you.

"Eight killed, four missing in separate landslides in Satyawati","Eight people died and four went missing in separate landslides triggered by heavy rainfall in Satyawati Rural Municipality, Gulmi, on Tuesday morning. According to the District Police Office, six people died in Birkhuna landslide and two others in Kasingthala. The four missing persons are from Bhirkuna and Singdi.Until Tuesday evening, police had retrieved six bodies from the landslide debris. Prakash Bhattarai, a local, said the area is prone to more landslides, as the rain has yet to stop. “Tuesday morning brought in heavy rainfall that triggered landslides. Locals and security personnel are making efforts to search for missing persons,” Bhattarai said.The injured persons are currently undergoing treatment at Thulolumpek Health Post. Yadunath Paudel, chief district officer, said the District Disaster Management Committee has started relief and rescue works in the municipality. “A team of security personnel and officials of the District Administration Office has reached the incident site to start rescue work,” said Paudel.In total, 75 families of Satyawati-3 and 4 have been displaced by the landslides. Most of them are taking shelter at their neighbours’ houses. Durga Taramu, a teacher of Siddha Basic School in Singdi, said the school building has been swept away by a landslide.“The settlements are dense around the area where the landslides took place,” said Taramu. “If the rain continues, the settlements are at risk of further landslides. The area has to be evacuated immediately.”Landslides have displaced 15 out of a total 35 families in Bhirkuna. Dilliraj Bhattarai, a ward member, said that since there are hardly any men in the villages, rescue and relief operations have been delayed. “Most men have gone to India for jobs, leaving women and children behind,” said Bhattarai. The incident site in Singdi is around 65 kilometres east of Tamghas, the district headquarters of Gulmi district.  ***What do you think?Dear reader, we’d like to hear from you.

Controlling firearms is a major security challenge in Kapilvastu,"Paras Puri was shot at by two motorcycle-borne assailants in Bidhyanagar of Kapilvastu district on March 31. He succumbed to injuries at a hospital in Butwal. Police investigation showed the assailants had used a pistol to commit the crime. The murderers are yet to be arrested.Similarly, twenty-eight-year-old Dipendra Kumar Chaudhary of Motibhari was shot dead following a dispute with his neighbour on November 23 last year. The neighbour, Ajit Pandey, had shot Chaudhary five times and fled the scene. Pandey is still at large.These are just two cases where small weapons were used with the intent to cause grave bodily harm. Use of firearm is unchecked in areas that share border with India, according to Superintendent of Police Deep Shumsher Rana.According to Rana, firearms are easily smuggled into the district via the open border. “We don’t have modern security devices to control firearms smuggling. And such weapons are increasingly being used for extortion, abduction and murder. This has become a major security threat in the district,” Rana said.According to a security source, possession and brandishment of weapons is considered a social prestige in various parts of the district. “People’s representatives and the civil society leaders should convince the weapon owners to surrender their arms to the authorities,” Rana said. As per the data available at the District Police Office, security personnel seized two submachine guns, two muskets, three country-made pistols, a Chinese pistol and a total of 203 bullets from various parts of the district in the fiscal year 2018/19. Security officials believe that there are still many illegal weapons in the district.Many people feel that the law enforcement agency is not doing much to control the smuggling and use of firearms. “Police only seize illegal weapons if they find them on a person during security checks. Otherwise, they do not have any concrete plans to control illegal firearms,” said a local of Taulihawa preferring anonymity.Nanda Kishwor Sharma, a businessperson in Krishnanagar, said that the business community in the district has been a victim of extortions and threats by bands of local thugs. “They (extortionists) threaten us with weapons if we do not pay them,” Sharma said. Chief District Officer Gajendra Bahadur Shrestha said smuggling of firearms in the border areas has become a major security challenge. “We will raise the issue during the meeting of the security officers of Nepal and India,” said Shrestha. ***What do you think?Dear reader, we’d like to hear from you.

Butwal evicts squatters from public land to construct covered hall,"The city of Butwal has evicted 16 landless families from two kathas of public land to construct a public covered hall.The displaced families had been living in the area for the last 48 years. The city office had notified the residents multiple times before evicting them, according to Shivaraj Subedi, Butwal mayor. The city employed a bulldozer to cleared the land of shanties in the third week of May. Hari Bishwokarma, one of the displaced, said that they had staged a protest after the city evicted them from the area. “We don’t have any other place to go,” said Bishwokarma. On Wednesday, the city office and the squatters had reached an agreement. Butwal would provide each displaced family with Rs 25,000 and assured them that new homes would be built for them under the People's Housing Programme within a year. “The metropolitan office is going to manage a suitable place for them to live in temporarily and then we will build permanent houses for them,” said Subedi.A stable constructed by the queen of Yuddha Shumsher once stood on the land, said Kalpana Devi Gautam, one of the displaced. After the two-storey building collapsed 48 years ago, landless people gradually encroached on the land. “We have been living there ever since,” said Gautam.On June 7, the squatters had also filed a complaint at the High Court in Tulsipur, demanding the return of their land, citing the fact that they had been living there for a long time. The court, however, issued an interim order stating that individuals or groups cannot lay claim to public land.  What do you think?Dear reader, we’d like to hear from you.

Province 5 districts have no offices dedicated to women,"When the country adopted federalism, all women and children offices in Province 5 were dissolved. The idea was to set up a dedicated office that would specifically cater to women issues.Two years have passed since the country was federated, but the province has still not opened its women’s office. Women’s rights activists have begun to question the role of women under the new system. One among them is Gyanu Paudel.“Women played an important role to establish democracy and federalism in the country. It now seems like their roles have been completely forgotten. The state has ignored their needs; shrugged away the roles women played while the men sat down to prepare the federal structure,” Paudel said. Women-related plans and policies have been greatly affected in the absence of a government institution which would have made it easier for policies to be formulated and budgets to be passed, say women’s rights activists. Paudel argues that there are challenges now to achieve the targets set for women development and gender equality for lack of a separate government office dedicated to women’s issues in Province 5.After federalism, the Local Government Operation Act 2074 BS adjusted all thematic offices of the districts with the local level. Accordingly, the then Women and Children Office was brought under local unit. Stating that the offices adjusted in the local units were not enough to execute state works, both the federal and provincial governments set up some thematic offices, but they failed to open an office for women and children in the district level.Radha Kumari Gyawali, central member of the ruling Nepal Communist Party, said the absence of a separate woman office at the district and provincial levels is the result of a patriarchal mindset. “It looks like the decision-making team comprised of only men. They completely left women out,” she said.“During the transitional period on the run-up to federalism, we had lobbied with the centre to include a separate women ministry at the provincial level and a women office in the district level. The committee had assured us that such offices would be established, but they failed to keep the promise,” said Gywali. There are seven ministries under the Province 5 government, none of which is a ministry for women. Women-related issues are overseen by the Social Development Ministry which also looks after education, health, youth, sports, senior citizens, and the physically disabled. There are seven directorates under the federal government, but none is for women and children. Similarly, out of a total of 145 offices under the Provincial 5 government, not a single one is dedicated to women. Social Development Minister Sudarshan Baral admitted that the ministry has not been able to penetrate the grassroots level and select plans and policies targeted at women. “We prepared plans and selected some projects last year in consultation with women leaders, lawmakers and representatives of some social organisations, but we weren’t able to implement the projects at the local level,” said Baral.There are two directorates—health and education—under the Social Development Ministry, but neither caters to women. The Social Division Office is responsible to work for women, children, disabled and senior citizens. “It is difficult to work because there are no separate provisions, infrastructure, resources and budget for women-centric offices. We just carry out the daily administration works,” said Sharada Belbase, the division office chief. “Programmes targeted at women have yet to be implemented effectively.” Baral said the province government was aware of the difficulties and challenges of working for women’s rights and development without the support of dedicated offices and his ministry is making efforts to address the issue. “We have asked the federal government to set up a separate directorate for women and children. We are also preparing to set up a new structure in the provincial level itself,” Baral said.","Published at : July 17, 2019",Butwal,Amrita Anmol
Most local judicial committees in Province 5 are idle for lack of office space,"Eight cases were registered at the judicial committee of Rambha Rural Municipality in Palpa district this fiscal year. Three cases seeking divorce were forwarded to the district court while five others were settled in agreement between the disputants without holding a bench.“We don’t even have a room to hold a bench. We are compelled to settle the disputes in agreement,” said Radha Kumari Shrestha, the vice-chairperson of Rambha Rural Municipality, who heads the judicial committee. According to Shrestha, the rural municipality office has been operating from a congested rented building and the judicial committee does not even have a room to hold discussions. “The vice-chairperson, account officer and other employees have to share a room. There is no possibility of holding discussions and forming a judicial bench,” added Shrestha.The new constitution, promulgated by the Constituent Assembly in 2015, has envisaged the provision of judicial committees in each of the 753 local level units in the country with an objective to ensure that justice is delivered.The Local Government Operation Act 2074 BS clarifies the functions and duties of the local judicial committee. The judicial committee has been empowered to settle disputes related to 13 specific matters including property boundary disputes; disputes regarding canals, dams, ditches or allocation of water; encroachment on roads or way out; disputes about compensation for damage to crops; disputes about payment of wages; and disputes about lost and found cattle.However, the judicial committee in most of the local units have been unable to execute their responsibilities effectively even after two years of local level elections in the country. Lack of infrastructure and employees, lack of awareness regarding the provision of the judicial committee in the grass roots level and lack of legal knowledge among the people’s representatives are the major hurdles behind the ineffectiveness of the judicial committee.A huge number of the local units in Province 5 does not have their own office buildings and are finding it doubly difficult to manage a separate space for the judicial committee. According to the people’s representatives, victims are reluctant to visit the judicial committee as there is no secrecy and secure environment.Shiva Kumari Chaudhary, deputy mayor of Shivaraj Municipality in Kapilvastu district, said that discussions are held in open rooms and the disputants feel uncomfortable talking about their issues. “Secrecy and security are very important while settling cases with legal boundaries. The disputants refrain from speaking out clearly and present their cases. The environment is not conducive for disputants,” she added. Manisara Nepali of Purbakhola Rural Municipality in Palpa came all way to the district administration office in Tansen, the district headquarters, last month to file a case about facing social discrimination in her village. The district administration immediately wrote to the Purbakhola Rural Municipality office and sent the victim there stating that such cases should be settled by the local judicial council. “I did not know about the provision of the judicial committee in the local body. I wasn’t aware of such an office so I came all the way to Tansen. Had I known earlier, I would have approached the committee in Purbakhola itself,” said Nepali.As per the prevailing legal provision, there are three members in the judicial committee headed by the deputy chief of the local unit. Two elected representatives are selected by the meeting of the village council or municipal council. The committee can also appoint legal practitioners for help in settling the disputes.Some disputants and even legal practitioners claim that the judicial committee has not been able to function impartially since the members are elected candidates of various political parties. “I registered a complaint at the judicial committee over a dispute regarding local development project,” said a woman from Arghakhanchi district, who chose to remain anonymous. “The coordinator of the judicial committee is affiliated to a political party and the case was filed against the activists of her party. So my complaint was not even heard.” She added that the people’s representatives fail to take decisions against the activists and supporters of the political party they represent.The legal practitioners are also not convinced about fair justice delivery by the judicial committee. According to them, the people’s representatives elected from various political parties fail to exercise their legal rights.“The voters influence the members of the judicial committee and the members never take action against the activists of their own party so they remain neutral. So far, the judicial committees are only for name sake,” said Bijaya Khatri, advocate and vice-chairman of Arghakhanchi District Bar.","Published at : July 19, 2019",Palpa/ Arghakhanchi/ Kapilvastu/ Bardiya,"Madhab Aryal						,"
Anti-child marriage campaigners work amid challenges in Banke,"On May 3, a wedding was to be held at Nepalgunj sub-metropolitan city. The families of the bride and bridegroom arrived in Nepaljgunj from Dailekh, their hometown, two days prior and started preparations. But the bride-to-be was underage. After finding this bit of information, Hira Khatri, 19, of Nayabasti in Nepalgunj, a campaigner against child marriage, duly informed the Ganapur Police Post. Then on the day of the wedding, a police team and other social campaigners reached the wedding venue and stopped the marriage. Between mid-April to mid-May this year, Khatri says she has stopped six cases of child marriage.Khatri’s activism has brought many praises but it has also made her a target of ridicule and dislike in the sub-metropolitan city, so much so that villagers have started to keep a distance from her. “I know what I’m doing is right, but it’s not easy. Some villagers blame me for ruining their children’s lives,” she says. According to Khatri, her work doesn’t come without challenges. Some villagers have taken to throwing stones at her house at night to verbally abusing Khatri. “Some villagers have threatened my family members, and my family is worried about me but I’m committed to work towards this cause,” said Khatri, who is also vice-chairperson of the District Teenage Girl’s Network, a community-led initiative.Diwa Bahadur Chhetri, advisor of Child Club, a government unit in the sub-metrolpolitan city, said that anti-child marriage campaigners often express concerns about feeling unsafe. “The campaigners inform the police about a child marriage taking place, but the police don’t keep the informants anonymous which puts these girls in danger,” said Chhetri. Stating that some anti-child marriage campaigners have left their villages as the parents, who try to marry off their underage sons and daughters, often blame them.Shyam Kumari Paija, chief at the Women’s and Child Service Centre in Banke, said that child rights activists are at risk of being harassed, ridiculed and sometimes even threatened for intervening in other people’s matter. “We are able to stop child marraiges only if somebody informs us about it,” said Paija, adding that although the practice of child marriage is still rampant—only a few cases registered in the District Police Office (DPO). According to the data of the DPO, only four cases of child marriage were registered in the DPO last year. Although Nepal abolished child marriage in 1963, it is still widely practices especially in the rural areas of the country.Child rights campaigners say that it is more challenging to stop child marriages in the border areas due to the legal variations in marriageable age in Nepal and India; the legal marriageable age in India is 18 years as opposed to 20 in Nepal, as per the Civil and Criminal Code of Nepal. “A couple fled to India and got married before I could take any action,” she said.A Human Rights Watch report published in September 2016 states that around 37 percent of girls in Nepal marry before the age of 18 and 10 percent are married by age 15.

Closure of nutrition rehabilitation centre puts children’s lives at risk,"Aarushi Chaudhary was diagnosed with severe malnutrition last month.The three-year-old girl from Dhanibagiya of Ghorahi Sub-metropolitan City, Dang, weighed just eight kilograms when she was brought to a local health facility.She needed immediate medical intervention. So the health workers suggested Aarushi’s mother, Laxmi, to take her daughter to the nutrition rehabilitation centre run by Rapti Academy of Health Sciences, what was formerly Rapti Zonal Hospital.But when Laxmi reached the academy with her emaciated baby girl, paediatricians told her that the academy’s nutrition rehabilitation centre was no longer in operation, that the facility was closed down six months ago.Laxmi was, for the second time, advised by health officials to seek her daughter’s treatment elsewhere—this time either in Nepalgunj or Butwal.The academy’s nutrition rehabilitation centre was one of 22 such facilities opened by the Ministry of Health and Population throughout the country. Today, it serves as the academy’s guest house.According to Mahendra Prasad Shrestha, spokesperson for the ministry, the nutrition rehabilitation at Rapti Academy of Health Sciences is one of the many services that have been disrupted ever since the institution was established last year.“The academy was set up to provide additional and quality services. But patients are now deprived of several services,” Shrestha told the Post.The ministry has formed a five-member team to investigate into the irregularities reported in the academy.Dr Arjun Sapkota, a member of the probe team, said that patients from Dang and other nearby districts have been directly affected by the poor state of the academy.“Doctors at the hospital are referring patients to Tulsipur, Nepalgunj, or Butwal,” Sapkota told the Post.Health workers say the most concerning thing is the academy’s decision to close down the nutrition rehabilitation centre because malnutrition is still an issue that the country is struggling to address.According to the 2016 Nepal Demographic Health Survey, 36 percent of children under five years of age in the country suffer from chronic malnutrition (stunting or low height-for-weight) and 10 percent suffer from acute malnutrition (wasting or low weight-for-height). Another 27 percent of children are underweight and one percent are overweight.Closure of the nutrition rehabilitation centre has affected the treatment of undernourished children from Dang, Rolpa, Rukum (East), Rukum (West), Salyan and Pyuthan. Every month, the centre used to treat over 30 children from these districts.Laxmi Gaire, who was in charge of the now closed nutrition rehabilitation centre, said that the academy forcefully shut the facility.“All eight staff nurses and dieticians including myself were relieved of our duties. The academy has not officially declared the centre’s closure, but malnourished children are not treated here anymore,” Gaire told the Post.Kedar Parajuli, chief of the nutrition section under the Family Welfare Division of the Department of Health Services, says children having cleft-lip or cleft palate, who have difficulty eating and swallowing, have been affected the most by the closure of the nutrition rehabilitation centre.“The nutrition rehabilitation centre used to provide treatment to such children and refer them to hospitals for surgery after making them healthy. Now these children are deprived of treatment,” said Parajuli. “We cannot reduce the existing malnutrition rate by closing nutrition rehabilitation centres.”Meanwhile, the condition of baby Aarushi remains the same. Her mother, Laxmi, could not take her to Nepalgunj or Butwal.“The doctors told me that I had to admit Aarushi to a nutrition rehabilitation centre.

Lumbini area affected by the pollutants and chemicals emitted by large-scale industries operated on the other side of the border,"After the Supreme Court ordered a ban on new factories in the Lumbini area on Sunday, locals living near Lumbini, said that the area is choking in pollution not only because of Nepali industries operating in the area but also from the large industries across the border.In March, a writ petition was filed at the Supreme Court demanding the conservation of the Lumbini area. Conservationists and legal advocates had lodged the writ at the apex court, arguing that the rampant registration of private industries could potentially have a serious impact on the conservation of the historic and archaeological site. Locals said that Indian industries operating across the border lie only around 15km away from Lumbini. According to them, the birth place of Lord Buddha, which is also a UNESCO world heritage site, is facing major pollution threats from large-scale industries based in Siddharthanagar in India. Siddharthanagar is around 8km from central Lumbini.There are numerous brick kilns, rice mills, liquor industries and drugs pharmaceutical industries in Kakrahwa, Mahale and Fariniya in Siddharthanagar, locals say. Smoke, dust and chemical pollutants emitted from those industries have adverse effects on the archeological sites of Lumbini, they say.Four years ago, a team from the Central Department of Environmental Science had conducted a study on the effects of pollution in Lumbini area. The team was led by Ram Prasad Regmi, a professor at Central Department of Physics, Tribhuvan University.The study showed that the main cause of pollution in the area was due to smoke emitted by industries, fire wood and burning foliage and vehicles. Om Prakash Yadav, a civil society leader of Marchawar area, said that the pollutants and smoke emitted from Indian industries reach up to Butwal from Lumbini and Bhairahawa. He adds, “Smoke emitted from more than 10 brick kilns covers the whole sky on some days.”Yubaraj Kandel, an environment researcher, said that one can’t even walk for 10 minutes in Fariniya bazaar and its vicinity without wearing masks. “Farmers also excessively use pesticides in the fields, and these chemical pollutants also have affected the Lumbini area,” said Kandel.“During the course of the study, we found that the pollution and chemicals emitted from the Indian territory spread towards the hilly areas too,” said Regmi, adding that the effect of pollutants was also seen in Tansen.Archeologists said that priceless archaeological sites such as Ashoka Pillar, and statues, among other artifacts stand to face corrosion by excessive pollution. They have raised concerns that the pollutants and smoke emitted from the nearby industries will have a negative impact on the habitat and the life of endangered species while also affecting the agricultural output and biodiversity. The pollution emitted from 40 industries being operated on the Nepali area, in addition to the pollution making its way in from India, is causing irreversible damage to the population living in the area, showed the study. Kul Prasad Neupane, chairman of Siddharthanagar Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said that the government has only seen and studied the impact of industries inside Nepal. “The Lumbini area has been affected due to industries operated on the other side of the border too,” said Neupane, adding that the government should pay attention towards the problems caused by industries in the border areas.Arjun Prasad Pokharel, Chief District Officer in Rupandehi, however, said that they will start a process to implement the Supreme Court’s order. “It’s the responsibility of the entire nation to conserve archeological sites,” said Pokharel. “I hope the concerned stakeholders will help the administration implement the court’s decision.” He adds, “There’s huge investment in industries. It is not possible to shift industries or close them immediately. However, we will make efforts to conserve Lumbini.”","Published at : July 2, 2019",Rupandehi,Ghanashyam Gautam
Uncertainty lies ahead for students of Martyrs’ Memorial School,"Perhaps, my mother would still watch my photo over and over. In my memory, perhaps, she would cry a river.Kalpana Adhikari often sings this wistful lament of a child’s longing for her mother before her classmates. Her poignant rendition never fails to make her listeners sad.Most of the students at Martyrs’ Memorial Boarding School in Tulsipur, Dang, can relate to Adhikari’s song.Adhikari is among the 450 students who study and live at the school for the children orphaned during the decade-long Maoist insurgency.Adhikari, who is originally from Gothimula village in Bharta Rural Municipality-3, arrived at the school six years ago.Her father, Nainaraj, who was a Maoist functionary, was killed by the police in 2002.When Adhikari was born, her father was already dead. Her mother, Pulki, remarried and Adhikari was sent off to live with her father’s sister.It was her aunt who admitted Adhikari to the school.Adhikari, who is currently in tenth grade, last saw her mother six years ago. She misses her. “I talk with her often on the phone and visit my hometown once a year, but since my mother is in a new house now, I don’t feel comfortable going there,” she says.For Adhikari and the other children at Martyrs’ Memorial Boarding School, their school is their home.The school was originally established as the ‘People’s School’ in 2066 BS by the Maoist party during wartime. It was one of many schools run by the Maoist party which, at the time, deemed all mainstream curriculum as ‘bourgeois education’ and taught its own curriculum befitting the ideology embraced by the party.All such party-run schools were turned into ‘Martyrs Memorial Schools’ and adopted the curriculum of public schools after the peace deal.Today, these schools are run with state funds. They offer free schooling and accommodation to children until grade twelve.The school where Adhikari goes to has 261 boys and 189 girls.While most of the senior students at the school are glad that they have the opportunity to complete high school education, they are also anxious about their future.Principal Narayan Poudel says even though the students have been doing well at their studies, their future after the twelfth grade is uncertain.“We cannot do anything about it because the government allocates budget for students only up to twelfth grade,” says Poudel.To help the students get jobs after completing their high school, the school is plans to introduce various skill-based subjects, but nothing concrete has come of it.“Since the students don’t have families to support them, many pass-outs from this school are working as labourers in India while others are jobless,” Poudel says.An uncertain future lies ahead of the students of Martyrs’ Memorial Boarding School, unless the government comes up with a programme for the children orphaned by the war.Seventh-grader Suwasti Buda dreams of becoming a doctor when she grows up, but deep down she knows that, with no one to support and guide her, even the chances of her going to college are rare, much less going to a medical school.“Since we can’t stay at the school forever, I don’t know what will happen after I have graduated high school,” she says.","Published at : July 2, 2019",Dang,Durga Lal KC

"Casteism is so deeply entrenched, not even law can deter it","Elected local representatives from Dalit communities in Province 5 say that they continue to be treated as low-caste people in their constituencies.Though the constitution has made caste-based discrimination a punishable crime, casteism and untouchability custom are still prevalent in many parts of the province.Tulasa Sunar, deputy chief of Gaumukhi Rural Municipality in Pyuthan district, says as a Dalit she faces discrimination every day.“We are not allowed to enter some houses or eat together with non-Dalits. Whatever the legal provisions, untouchability custom is very much alive,” she said.There are more than 60 elected Dalit representatives in nine local units of Pyuthan. And most of them say they feel unfairly treated in their day-to-day lives.The concept of casteism, according to Tulasa, is so deeply entrenched in the community psyche that not even the law can deter a person from a so-called high caste from denigrating and dehumanising a Dalit.It would be facile to argue that people like Tulasa ought to be more assertive and fight for equal and fair treatment for Dalits. They are facing against centuries-old plague of casteism, passed down from generation to generation like a family heirloom.“We are invited to various functions as elected representatives, but we aren’t allowed to participate alongside others. Our social conditioning is such that villagers who have known us for years are not going to treat us as their equals,” said Mana Kumari Bishwakarma, an elected Dalit representative from Rolpa district.For Rita BK, not much has changed since she was elected as a member of the District Coordination Committee of Rukum (East). She remains a lowling in the eyes of her non-Dalit colleagues, to say nothing of the people in her village.“I don’t even know what my role is in the office. I am not kept abreast of the issues that are in discussion. My job essentially could be summed as signing documents for decisions that I have no prior knowledge of,” said Rita. “How could we fulfil the expectations of those who elected us when we are excluded from decision-making roles?”Ishwori Pariyar, another elected Dalit representative from Nepalgunj, Banke, shared a similar experience of being excluded by her colleagues.“I am never called for ward office meetings. I even brought this issue before my colleagues once, but I continue to be treated as a pariah,” she said.Since confronting her colleagues, Ishwori has been invited to only one meeting.The elected Dalit representatives in Province 5 believe that legal provisions and political commitments are not adequate to end casteism. They say the poor economic status of Dalit communities is also a major factor as to why Dalit people continue to be discriminated against in Nepalisociety.“For generations, our political system and tradition have immiserated the Dalits to maintain and nurture caste hierarchy. So, political and social awareness will not be enough to end untouchability. Dalit communities must be lifted out of poverty in order to effectively eliminate casteism and untouchability from our society,” said Karma Lal Pariyar, a member of the District Coordination Committee of Rolpa.(With inputs from our local correspondents)","Published at : June 19, 2019",Butwal,Province 5 Bureau
Private schools in a Rupandehi municipality raise school fees,"Until last academic year, Sarita Lamichhane had been paying Rs 1,850 monthly as tuition fee for her fourth grader son.From this academic year, her monthly spending for her firstborn’s tuition has reached Rs 2,585. In addition to that, she also pays Rs 1,885 a month to school her youngest son, who is in the upper kindergarten. This mother of two from Siddharthanagar Munici-pality of Rupandehi district is worried if she will be able to afford private education for her children.“I have had to borrow money to pay for my children’s school from this academic year, ” she said.Sarita is unsure if private schools are allowed to hike tuition fees as and when they like. She is not alone in this. Many parents here who send their children to private schools are going through the same emotions.A majority of the private schools in the municipality have increased their tuition fees from 15 to 30 percent from this academic year.The concerned parents have expressed their frustration at the authorities responsible for monitoring tuition fee hikes in private schools. They say that private schools decided to raise the tuition costs without consulting the matter with the concerned local unit and the responsible education body.Private schools are supposed to submit their fee structures to the local unit and the concerned authorities, but most private schools in Siddhrathanagar have not done so.“Every school is supposed to organise parents’ meeting and seek their approval to increase the tuition fees by mid-December. None of the schools has followed this rule,” said Dipendra Dhakal, coordinator of the District Education Coordination Unit.The local government in Siddharthanagar also failed to intervene in what seems to be a unilateral decision of private schools to hike their fees.Under the federal set-up, Dhakal says, local units reserve all rights regarding school matters.Although the government has issued the Institutional School Fee Fixation Standard Directive-2016 for fee structure, most schools have not been following it.Many schools have not been providing the facilities for which they charge parents hefty sums. While the law requires schools to provide scholarships to at least 10 percent of their students, it has come to light that not many schools have been doing so.Most private schools in Siddharthanagar say that they raised the tuition fees in order to increase the salary and benefits of their teachers and employees.One private school teacher, however, said that teachers’ salary has not been raised in a long time. “We don’t even receive the salary fixed by the government,” he said. Chetansil Lamsal, education officer of the Municipality, said that his office was unable to monitor private schools as it has no staff to do so. One official can’t keep an eye on everything, Lamsal replied when asked why the municipal office did not intervene when the private schools increased their tuition fees.","Published at : June 17, 2019",Bhairahawa,Madhav Dhungana

Juvenile cases on the rise in Rupandehi,"In mid-May, police arrested a 13-year-old boy from Saljhandi under allegations of him raping an eight-year-old girl. After the arrest, the police investigated the case for a week and the Office of District Attorney drafted a report based on their findings. On May 30, the boy was called to the Juvenile Bench at the Rupandehi District Court for a hearing. Chief Judge Nariswar Bhandari proceeded to question the boy but the latter didn’t speak a word. Bhandari then sought the help of the alleged boy’s mother. After she intervened, the boy started to talk. “While talking to the boy, I realised that he has “absent” parents. His mother is a migrant worker who had come to Nepal after being informed about her son’s misdemeanour. His father is a chronic drunk,” Bhandari said. “It came as no surprise to me to see the boy, at such a young age, moving around in bad company.” The boy’s mother, visibly upset at what was unfolding in front of her eyes, said, “I know I should have been around for him, to guide him, but I also had to think about being financially stable to feed the family.”In the past year, nine boys have been accused of rape in the district. Five have been returned to their homes after counseling, while four have been sent to juvenile reform centres after being found guilty.On April 5, a 12-year-old was arrested on the charge of drug abuse. The boy was arrested from the Belhiya Buspark at the Nepal-India border during a regular security check. The boy was found carrying drugs—such as Diazepam 64, Nufin 64 and Fenaragan 64 Ampul—taped around his body. According to police, the drugs were bought with IRs 15,000 in India and were being smuggled into Nepal. The boy was being employed by a drug trafficker to cross the border in exchange for money, they say. The boy has been charged under the drug abuse and trafficking law and is currently being kept at the Rupandehi Reform Centre. As per prevailing legal provisions, children over the age of 10—who are found to be involved in criminal activities—are punishable by law. If found guilty, the children of the said age-group are subject to fine and prison sentence depending upon the nature of the crime and the age of the perpetrator. Prison sentence in this case means keeping the children in reform centres.A three-member committee—including the chief judge, an expert on children’s issues and a child psychologist—has been formed in every district court to look into their cases. The committee is also tasked with helping the children reform their ways and to provide them justice. Of late, crime rate among juveniles is on the rise in the district. While in the past year, 16 such cases were officially registered, the figure has seen a sharp rise this year, with 85 cases registered within 10 months. All of the alleged children are male, charged under crimes such as drug abuse and trafficking, robbery, rape, murder, abduction, manhandling and forgery of official stamps. Forty-one allegations are under drug abuse, 25 under robbery, nine under rape, eight under murder, and one each under public offence, forgery of official stamp, abduction and citizenship abuse. Out of the total cases, 46 have been settled. A total of 62 children were presented to the court. Most of the children were charged guilty. Out of which, 29 have been returned home after counseling while 33 are sent to reform centres. Since last year, people under the age of 16 were legally considered children. But the Civil and Criminal Code, which came into effect since August 17, 2018, defines people under 18 as children. Netra Prasad Bhusal, the registrar of the court, says this change in law is partially responsible for the sudden rise of cases against children. Chief judge Bhandari, also the coordinator of the Children Enquiry Committee, said that the main reasons behind children getting involved in crimes are poor parenting, family culture, and peer pressure. “Most of the children charged under crimes come from impoverished and/or dalit families,” Bhandari said. According to Shiva Gaudel, advocate and chairperson of Nepal Child Welfare Organization, children from impoverished backgrounds find their way into a life of crime because the illiteracy rate among their parents is high. Importance to child care, their education and their rights aren’t prioritised. “Most of wayward children become embroiled in criminal activities because they lack guidance and are easily influenced by seniors and crumble under peer pressure,” Gaudel said. Justice of the Supreme Court and chair of Juvenile Justice Coordination Committee Dr Ananda Mohan Bhattarai said that most children commit crimes imitating seniors. “In some cases, children are swindled by older people,” he says, “while in other cases, even friends, neighbours and teachers encourage the children to commit crimes.” Loknath Gyawali, chairperson of Parents’ Association, Rupandehi, said that most of the juveniles who have engaged in crimes and delinquencies suffer from poor parenting and the widespread method of education by rote in schools. “It is high time the parents become aware and pay attention to their children’s upbringing and education,” Gyawali said. “Schools too need to start incorporating moral education in their curricula and engage children in extracurricular activities.”","Published at : June 4, 2019",Butwal,Amrita Anmol
‘Smart Chhori’ to prepare daughters of martyrs of armed-conflict for a better tomorrow,"Sixteen-year-old Kalpana Adhikari, a tenth grader, came from Kalikot to Tulsipur. She was a little girl when she lost her father in the armed conflict. Soon after, her mother married another man, leaving Kalpana to chart out her own path.Six years ago, Kalpana joined the Shahid Smriti Residential Secondary School at Bankatti in Tulsipur sub-metropolis. The boarding school is home to 189 girls like Kalpana; most having lost their parents or guardians at an early age. The child victims of the armed conflict that lasted from 1996 to 2006 have now grown into young adults but the protected life they live inside the four walls of boarding school haven’t prepared them for the world outside. To rectify this, the sub-metropolis started a campaign called ‘Smart Chhori’ (smart daughter) wherein the adolescent girls are given lessons on topics that will broaden their knowledge of the world outside the school.The campaign, started from the current academic session that began from mid-April, aims to help the girls look beyond the traumatic phase of their lives, and prepare for a better tomorrow.“We don’t really see much of the world outside our school. We spend most of our time between the school and hostel. The classes being conducted in our school have helped me learn a lot. They teach us about self-confidence and how important it is for us to know about things outside of our coursework,” said Kalpana.Gokarna Dahal, chief of the health department of the sub-metropolitan office, said these girls have had to deal with severe mental trauma of losing their guardians to the conflict and had to spend their childhood without a guiding light. Keeping the girls’ backgrounds in mind, the department decided to run programmes that will help the girls overcome their trauma and equip them with self-confidence to live a life without the burden of post traumatic disorder.“This campaign helps boost self-confidence among girls. We provide them not only with basic skills needed in one’s everyday life,” said Dahal, “but also with knowledge about child rights, sexual health, sexual abuse, self-defence, and financial literacy so that these girls will grow up to become confident independent women.”The Smart Chhori campaign, which started from Gurujajur Primary School, will also be expanded to other schools, according to Dahal.Bhabi Pun Magar, 14, of Libang Municipality, Rolpa, also lost her father in the conflict. Like Kalpana, she too was left alone in the world when her mother decided to remarry. She came to Tulsipur five years ago and is now in grade 9.  She said, “I always had inhibitions about being a girl thinking that I would have to depend on a man to help me live my life but now after attending the Smart Chhori classes, I’m beginning to understand that I have numerous possibilities to live a good life.” An aspiring singer, Chahana Pariyar, 11, originally from Tila Rural Municipality in Jumla, now has the confidence to believe that she will one day make it big in the music world. “I would always feel weak and under severe stress following the death of my father during the conflict years. But I’ve been taking stress management and women empowerment classes, and that has given me the confidence to believe in my dreams,” she said. Principal Narayan Poudel of Shahid Smriti Residential Secondary School said that girls from 16 districts are receiving residential education there. He said, “It is important to equip these girls with training and skills to lead a wholesome life but most importantly, it’s imperative to give them the confidence to believe in themselves.”","Published at : June 2, 2019",Dang,Durgalal KC
"Jagadishpur Lake drained out, putting wildlife in grave danger","Jagadishpur Lake, an artificial lake constructed for the purpose of irrigation, was enlisted in the Ramsar Wetlands Site on August 2003. The lake is spread over an area of 157 hectares and lies 11km north of Taulihawa, the district headquarters of Kapilvastu.Over the years, many species of reptiles, mammals and fishes among other wildlife have come to depend on the lake for sustenance. The lake is known to support 43 fish species, and they now face the danger of being wiped out. A month ago, the Badganga Irrigation Division Office decided to drain the lake to repair a connecting irrigation canal—leaving the wildlife in the area to fight for their survival.The western part of the lake has only 10 percent of water at present. The locals have also started to fish on the lake, killing at least 10 to 12 quintals of fishes daily.Ram Krishna Ghorasaine, chief of the irrigation division office, said, “Our priority is to supply water to the farmlands, and the irrigation canal is in need of repair. We aren’t concerned about birds and other wildlife.”Abdul Rasid Khan, a local, said that the concerned stakeholders have been turning a blind eye to the destruction of wildlife in and around the lake.Endangered fishing cats, tortoises, salamanders and birds are at risk after the lake dried up. According to conservationists, of the 872 species of birds found in Nepal, more than 164—including grebes, cormorants, herons, egrets, stork, ducks and geese, terns and gulls—are found in the lake.Birds migrate from Siberia, China, Russia, Mongolia, Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan to the area with the start of the winter season and remain there until February.Ornithologist Hem Sagar Baral said that endangered species who depend on the lake for survival are at grave danger.“Some bird species are currently in the middle of reproduction activities. The survival of the many species is at stake now,” Baral said.","Published at : June 2, 2019",Kapilvastu,Manoj Paudel

Krishni Tharu’s journey from ex-Kamlari to Deputy Speaker,"Krishni Tharu, Deputy Speaker in Provincial Assembly of Province 5, elected to the position in 2017, is a former Kamlari, an indentured girl child labourer, from the Tharu community.Born to a poor Tharu couple in Rajapur of Bardiya district 43 years ago, Krishni was only seven when she started working as a domestic helper, and was deprived of an education and of forming any familial bonds. As was the custom within her community, she was married to a Kamaiya (bonded labourer) when she turned 15. “I remember working from dusk till dawn for a pittance,” she says. “I then got married and continued the same work alongside my husband. That was the only way of life we knew; we couldn’t even imagine breaking the shackles of bonded labour and living a free life, whatever that meant.”After spending 18 years as a Kamlari and a Brukeni (a domestic helper working alongside her husband), Krishni realised that if she were to break away from this vicious cycle of poverty, subjugation and humiliation she herself will have to make a conscious effort. All around her, people from her community were raising their voices against Kamaiya/Kamlari practices in Nepal. This was an opportune moment for her to join the cause. Following her unwavering dedication to the cause, she was selected as chief of the Freed Kamaiya Network at the VDC level, deputy chairman at the district level and member at the central level. She actively took part and led protests organised in Kathmandu for the rights and welfare of the freed Kamaiyas. She was later elected as national chairperson of Kamaiya Mahila Jagaran Samaj and struggled for the rescue and rehabilitation of the Kamlaris and the freed Kamaiyas.For her work, she was then picked up as a proportional representation member for the provincial assembly by the CPN-UML party and was later nominated for the deputy speaker candidacy.Speaking to the Post, she said, “It took a lot for me to reach where I am today. Although the Kamlari and Kamaiya practices have been long abolished, there is still much to do for the community,” said Krishni. She has been continuously advocating for the education, employment and empowerment of women and backward communities in Nepal.The government declared Kamaiyas to be free on July 2, 2000. But Kamaiyas like Krishni had no place to go even after their emancipation. “I was compelled to stay at the landlord’s house with my husband and two children for seven months even after the government’s announcement. It was only much later that the state provided us with land where we built a hut and moved out of the landlord’s house,” said Krishni.Krishni, despite being a freed Kamaiya, still had to endure hardships and face humiliation in society during her struggle for her rights. “Despite such hurdles I did not give up on my struggle. I urged other people like me to raise their voices for our community’s rights,” said the deputy speaker.She joined the UML and vied for the deputy mayor position of Rajapur Municipality during the local elections in 2017, but was defeated. She was later included in the PR closed list by theUML and was elected for the provincial assembly.Krishi never got a chance to receive an education, but that did not deter her from learning to read and write in Nepali and English through adult literacy classes she enrolled herself in. She later passed grade eight and now convenes the provincial assembly meetings with due legal procedure. She is one of the few women lawmakers who encourage the participation of women in politics, and judicial and legal services.","Published at : March 9, 2019",Butwal,Amrita Anmol
Dang police arrest three leaders of Chand outfit for extortion,"Police on Tuesday arrested three district leaders of the Netra Bikram Chand-led Communist Party of Nepal from Tulsipur in Dang district.The leaders’ arrest comes at a time when the government has launched a crackdown on Chand-led party leaders following the detonation of an improvised explosive device near the gate of Ncell head office in Nakkhu, Lalitpur, which claimed the life of one person and injured two others on February 22.According to the District Police Office, Dang, Chand-led party’s district party office member Pradip Oli, district secretariat member Ishwari Pandey and district party member Rudra Oli have been arrested as part of the investigation following the spike in incidents of forceful donations and violence in the district.

People in remote Rolpa village rejoice arrival of motor vehicles,"The people of Homa-Hangbang, a remote village in Rolpa district, burst into celebration when a small convoy of motor vehicles reached their village for the very first time on a recent afternoon.They had been anticipating this moment from the day the work started on the final 4km section of the motor track connecting their village with Upper Risbang two years ago. More than 100 villagers, including women and elderly people, had contributed labour to open the track, which is part of the Libang-Homa Liban road.Kamal Budha Magar, chairman of the Hangbang Consumers Committee, said the villagers had donated their labour equivalent to around Rs 1.4 million while constructing the track.“The villagers were involved in every aspect of this project, from taking measurements to digging earth to open the track.
